          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement, teased by Trump on social media, would be the first since the U.S. imposed tariffs on trading partners. Details remain unclear, but discussions have included lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods and removing taxes on U.S. technology companies. The agreement could offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump and offset weaker relations with Europe after Brexit.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but warned that U.S.-China trade tariffs could restrict global container market volumes. The company revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the trade issues are primarily between China and the U.S. and have not yet significantly affected other trade lanes. The company's current policy includes 145% import duties on products from China, prompting Beijing to hit back with tariffs on U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. The forecast comes as the company reported a drop in revenue and profit for its fiscal fourth quarter, largely expected as fans await the new console. Investors are hopeful that Nintendo can maintain its popularity, with shares up 33% this year. However, the company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on countries where Nintendo's consoles are manufactured.</p>

          <p>Prisons minister James Timpson suggests more criminals could be tagged instead of being sent to prison, emphasizing he's not "soft on crime." The government is exploring how technology can monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison. Timpson acknowledges prisons are in a state of "crisis" with limited spare places and a rising population. He is also concerned about serious organized crime in prisons, which contributes to drug use and violence. The government has commissioned a sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Toyota presented a somber outlook, projecting a decline in operating profit for the fiscal year due to headwinds from a stronger yen and President Trump's tariffs.

The murkiness of Toyota's forecast highlights how the tariff agenda is impacting the auto industry.
