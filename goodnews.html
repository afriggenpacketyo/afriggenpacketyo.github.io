          <p>Tottenham is reportedly considering appointing Brentford boss Thomas Frank as their new head coach after Ange Postecoglou's departure. Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, though no dialogue has been confirmed yet. Frank, who has been with Brentford since 2018, led the team into the Premier League and established them as a top-flight club with a small budget. Brentford would be entitled to compensation for Frank, potentially exceeding ¬£10m, depending on his staff choices. The team finished tenth in the Premier League this season, a significant improvement over Tottenham's performance. The move could bring a fresh perspective to Tottenham's coaching strategy.</p>

Chipotle reported its first same-store sales decline since 2020 in the first quarter, citing consumer concerns about the economy. The company has lowered its outlook for full-year same-store sales growth, and shares have fallen 12% this year.

The city and county are increasing efforts to provide shade and cooling, especially in lower-income areas disproportionately affected by heat. Research indicates that trees can lower temperatures by at least 10 degrees, offering relief during record-high temperatures. The initiative aims to address "shade disparity" and improve the long-term viability of communities by maximizing both trees and water resources. The effort includes teaching the next generation about environmental consciousness through school garden clubs.</p>
