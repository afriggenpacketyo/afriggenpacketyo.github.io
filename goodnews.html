        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese customs officials are intensifying efforts to stop smugglers of Pop Mart toys, particularly the Labubu and Molly series, as the demand and prices for these dolls surge globally. Agents have confiscated undeclared toys from passengers attempting to resell them for profit, with hundreds of toys seized at airports in Hunan and Anhui provinces. This trend is driven by travelers buying the toys overseas, where they are sometimes cheaper due to currency fluctuations, and bringing them back to China for resale. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has rapidly expanded internationally with over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined ¬£122.7 million by Ofwat, the UK water regulator, for breaching rules related to sewage operations and shareholder dividends. This is the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, following its most extensive investigation to date, and will be paid by the company and its investors rather than customers. The fine includes ¬£104.5 million for sewage operation breaches and an additional ¬£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has penalized a water company for such payouts. Thames Water, which serves a quarter of the UK population, is under scrutiny for its performance and faces a ¬£20 billion debt, having recently secured a ¬£3 billion emergency loan.</p>

          <p>Tesco is implementing AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record levels in the UK. The technology identifies when items are not scanned properly and shows a replay to the customer, accompanied by a message prompting them to try again. While some shoppers have mocked the new system, comparing it to VAR in football, others have expressed concerns about increased surveillance. This move follows a similar initiative by Sainsbury's and comes in response to a significant rise in shoplifting offenses recorded by both police and retailers, costing the industry billions of pounds annually.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has agreed to pay $82.5 million to the federal government to settle claims related to the 2020 Bobcat Fire, which devastated areas northeast of Los Angeles. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the settlement, stating it provides significant compensation for firefighting costs and extensive damage to public lands. The government alleged the fire started due to inadequately maintained trees contacting electrical wires, leading to the closure of campgrounds and damage to the habitat of endangered species. While SCE will pay the settlement within 60 days, the utility does not admit any wrongdoing or guilt.</p>

The scandal, which emerged during the peak of the cost of living crisis, involved energy firms remotely changing smart meters or forcibly entering homes to install new meters.
