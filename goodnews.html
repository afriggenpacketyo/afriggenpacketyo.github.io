          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter net earnings, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. However, the company's operating earnings, a metric Buffett prefers, saw only a slight decline as its diverse portfolio of businesses generally performed well. The report also noted that Berkshire's massive cash reserve remains near a record high at $344.1 billion, as the company struggles to find attractively priced acquisition targets. This article also highlights speculation about potential mergers involving its BNSF railroad to compete with rivals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Preliminary research from Hiroshima University in Japan suggests that a common sweetener could have anti-cancer properties. The study found that stevia leaf extract, when fermented with a specific bacterium, demonstrated enhanced ability to fight pancreatic cancer cells in a laboratory setting. While researchers believe this substance is a promising candidate for future treatment, medical experts caution that the findings are very early and have not been tested in humans. The study represents a step in the discovery process for new treatments, but more research is required to determine its safety and effectiveness in patients.</p>

          <p>A review of a new memoir by a rural mail carrier in Virginia highlights the essential role the U.S. Postal Service plays in American life. The book, and the accompanying article, explores how postal workers provide a sense of order, predictability, and connection, especially in remote communities and during national crises. The piece reflects on the quiet heroism of mail delivery, detailing the logistical feats required to reach even the most isolated parts of the country. It frames the daily act of mail delivery as a powerful and consistent force in a world that can often feel chaotic.</p>

His business, which grew out of his travel-focused YouTube channel, offers small-group cultural immersion tours to less-traveled destinations like Iraq, Syria, and Pakistan. Last year, the tourism company and his YouTube channel generated a combined revenue of over $164,000, allowing him to build a new life abroad.

          <p>Comedian Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," continues his exploration of personal and societal anxieties, from his cat's health issues to the rise of authoritarianism. This article reviews the special as the third in a loose trilogy, noting Maron's controlled delivery and use of long-form narratives to connect his own psychological state with broader current events. A key segment delves into potential childhood trauma, which he uses not for pity but as a springboard to examine how people process inflicting harm on others. The review praises Maron's consistent and unflinching style of excavating humor from emotional vulnerability.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest and dedicated solely to international travel, is now weathertight, and key structures like baggage systems are being installed. The project is a central part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of the airport, aimed at replacing aging infrastructure to accommodate growing air traffic. The new terminal's design emphasizes natural light and will feature its own resilient microgrid for power.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from Special Counsel John Durham's report has weakened a central claim of an anti-Trump conspiracy during the 2016 election. The document concludes that emails purporting to show a "Clinton Plan" to demonize Trump were likely a fabrication created by Russian intelligence, cobbled together from genuine emails hacked from U.S. think tanks. This finding undermines the narrative, promoted by figures like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, that a "deep state" manufactured intelligence to harm Trump. The disclosure confirms the assessment of the individuals who denied ever writing the incriminating emails.</p>

          <p>The Australian Wallabies secured a hard-fought victory over the British and Irish Lions in the third and final Test match, denying the visitors a series whitewash. Played in Sydney amidst torrential rain and a 40-minute suspension for lightning, the hosts dominated the physical contest, outscoring the Lions three tries to two for a 22-12 win. The brutal conditions contributed to a scrappy game, with multiple players leaving the field for head injury assessments.

          <p>This article tells the story of Amber Meade, a woman who suffered from debilitating, constant pain for months after a foot injury before being diagnosed with chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS is a rare and difficult-to-treat disorder that can occur after an injury, causing extreme pain disproportionate to the original event. After failed treatments, Meade found a comprehensive rehabilitation program that combined specialized physical therapy with emotional coping strategies and medication. While there is no cure, the multi-pronged approach has significantly improved her quality of life and ability to function.</p>
