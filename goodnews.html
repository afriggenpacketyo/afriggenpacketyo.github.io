          <p>Exercise Talisman Sabre, the largest-ever military drill in Australia, has commenced, involving over 35,000 personnel from 19 countries, including the U.S., Japan, and several European and Pacific nations. The biennial exercise, which began in 2005, is being held for the first time partly outside Australia, with activities in Papua New Guinea. Australian officials anticipate surveillance from Chinese spy ships, a common occurrence in past exercises, but stated it would not disrupt the drills. The event highlights Australia's defense alliance with the United States amid complex regional dynamics, occurring concurrently with the Australian Prime Minister's visit to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are making substantial gains in Norway, which is considered a key market for EVs due to its favorable policies and high adoption rate. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG have captured approximately 10% of the market by offering competitively priced and technologically advanced vehicles. Unlike the U.S. and EU, Norway has not imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs, making it a crucial entry point for these brands into the European continent. While Tesla remains the dominant player, the rapid growth of Chinese competitors highlights a significant challenge for Western automakers in the evolving global EV landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, where Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain. The event coincided with the one-year anniversary of the failed assassination attempt on his life, which he commemorated in a statement reflecting on the incident. At the match, Trump was joined by family, advisers, and dignitaries, including FIFA President Gianni Infantino, and presented the championship trophy to Chelsea. The visit also provided an opportunity for his envoy to meet with Qatari officials regarding ongoing Gaza ceasefire negotiations, underscoring the blend of official duties with public appearances at major sporting events.</p>

          <p>German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is traveling to Washington to meet with his U.S. counterpart, Pete Hegseth, to discuss critical security issues. The agenda includes clarifying the U.S. stance on arms supplies to Ukraine, particularly Germany's offer to fund American Patriot air defense systems for Kyiv. Pistorius will also seek confirmation on Washington's commitment to deploy long-range missiles in Germany starting in 2026 and discuss the future of U.S. troop levels in Europe. The visit comes as Germany significantly increases its defense spending to meet NATO targets amid growing concerns over regional security.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation. This strategic move is not an acquisition; instead, Google will gain a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology, while the startup remains independent. The deal highlights the intense competition for top AI talent among major tech companies, following similar moves by Meta and Microsoft. Windsurf has gained popularity for its AI tools that assist developers in writing code, a rapidly growing segment of the software industry.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows, signaling strong institutional interest. Analysts suggest this momentum, fueled by long-term institutional buyers, could propel the cryptocurrency's price even higher in the near future. The rally also comes as the U.S. Congress prepares to deliberate on new crypto-focused legislation aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework, a development long awaited by the digital asset industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, surpassing analysts' expectations. This robust performance was supported by strong shipments to Southeast Asian nations and the European Union, which helped offset a continued, albeit slowing, decline in exports to the United States. Imports also saw a modest 1.1% increase, marking the first rise this year. The data suggests Chinese exporters are successfully diversifying into alternative markets in response to U.S. tariff policies, while a temporary trade truce has eased the decline in U.S.-bound trade ahead of an August deadline for a more durable deal.

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily led by a 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector and a rebound in construction, partly attributed to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy due to unclear U.S. tariff policies.

China is the largest consumer of Australian iron ore, but the transition to green steel requires higher-grade ore, potentially threatening this trade.
