          <p>Pattern Group, a prominent third-party reseller on Amazon, began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker "PTRN" after raising $300 million in its initial public offering. The company, which helps over 200 brands optimize online sales, saw its stock open at $13.50 per share, valuing the e-commerce accelerator at approximately $2.5 billion. The IPO comes amid a revitalized market for tech offerings but also faces uncertainties from global trade tensions and the company's significant reliance on the Amazon marketplace. The offering highlights the growth of third-party sellers, who now account for over half of all goods sold on Amazon's platform. (not investment advice)</p>

Savin founded the club in Russia but re-established it in Cyprus after fleeing his home country and condemning the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which led to him being charged in absentia for "discrediting" the Russian army. The club, which unites a diverse fanbase of Russian-speaking immigrants, was promoted after just three seasons.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion from investors, a move that would value the company at $200 billion. This fundraising effort reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, with competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI also securing massive investments at high valuations. The new capital is expected to fund the development of next-generation AI, including the construction of a large AI computer cluster in Memphis, Tennessee. The company's Grok chatbot has previously faced controversy, but investor interest in foundational AI models remains exceptionally strong.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, President Trump's former national security adviser, to serve as the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, ending an eight-month vacancy in the key diplomatic post. The confirmation, with a vote of 47 to 43, comes just before world leaders gather for the U.N. General Assembly. Waltz's confirmation had been delayed for months, partly due to controversy over a Signal chat that disclosed sensitive military details. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for major U.N. reform while stressing the importance of U.S. participation to counter China's growing influence.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to approximately 6.13%, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $750,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment is now about $4,559, which is over $450 less per month compared to the 7.04% rates seen at the start of 2025. This policy shift, driven by concerns over a weakening labor market, offers increased affordability for new buyers and attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. Over the life of the loan, the savings could exceed $160,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has advocated for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved this week. Kashkari stated that he believes President Trump's tariffs will have only a minimal long-term impact on inflation, creating room for easier monetary policy. His more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite the core consumer price index running above the Fed's 2% target. He believes the effect of tariffs on prices is likely a one-time event that will play out over several years. (not investment advice)</p>

He also suggested that the administration's immigration policies would have a disinflationary effect by easing pressure on shelter prices, putting his views in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee.

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has indicated that the Labour government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, stating the policy change is "on the table." The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. This issue has become a central point in the Labour deputy leadership contest between Phillipson and rival Lucy Powell, both of whom view removing the cap as crucial for tackling child poverty. Research from the Resolution Foundation suggests that axing the policy would lift approximately 470,000 children out of poverty.</p>
