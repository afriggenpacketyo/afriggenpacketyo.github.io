          <p>Several UK newspapers focus on the recent Commons vote backing a bill allowing some terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their lives, although the bill faces challenges in the House of Lords. The Daily Mail reports on peers promising a fight, while The Times notes the uphill battle ahead. The Daily Express celebrates the vote as a victory for campaigners and choice, while the Daily Mirror highlights the joy and protests surrounding the decision. Other front-page stories include a government plan to ban Palestine Action as a terror group after activists vandalized an RAF base, and NHS plans to map the DNA of every baby to assess disease risk. The varying perspectives on the assisted dying bill and the inclusion of other significant news items demonstrate a range of national concerns.

          <p>King Charles has recorded a message for researchers in Antarctica celebrating Midwinter's Day, praising their work in understanding climate change. This marks the 70th anniversary of the BBC's Antarctic Midwinter Broadcast, a tradition aimed at boosting morale in remote research stations during their winter isolation. The King acknowledges the researchers' resilience and commitment in tracking changes in the ice and examining humanity's role in relation to nature. The British Antarctic Survey, which the King praises, uses ice cores to analyze climate changes over hundreds of thousands of years, highlighting Antarctica's importance as a barometer of environmental change. </p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) plans to map the DNA of every newborn baby in England to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows an earlier announcement of a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies. </p>

These signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock before reaching the detector, which shouldn't have been possible. While follow-up observations have not confirmed the signals, researchers hope that larger, more sensitive detectors may be able to solve the mystery. </p>
