          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the more than $500 million financial penalty imposed on Donald Trump and other defendants in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. However, the ruling upheld the non-monetary sanctions, such as the independent monitor, designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The decision represents a significant legal victory for Trump, who praised the court's "courage" in its ruling.</p>

          <p>This article critiques the growing "COVID revisionist" narrative, which claims public health officials knowingly imposed ineffective and harmful pandemic restrictions. While acknowledging some mistakes, such as keeping schools closed too long, the author argues that the broader revisionist view is a dangerous overcorrection. The piece refutes claims that the pre-pandemic consensus was against non-pharmaceutical interventions and challenges the use of Sweden as a successful counterexample. The author warns that this narrative could undermine public health responses to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This increase coincided with a period of declining mortgage rates in May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease price pressure. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be nearing an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2008, he responded to a fatal car crash in which his own 15-year-old son, Ryan, was a passenger. This life-altering event transformed Didone into a national voice on the dangers of reckless and distracted driving, particularly in school zones during the back-to-school season. He now travels the country urging parents, young drivers, and communities to prioritize safety to prevent similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>A new photo essay documents the varied experiences of parents whose children have left home, challenging the traditional, singular image of the "empty nest." Through intimate portraits and interviews with parents in the Los Angeles area, the project reveals a complex mix of emotions, from loss and disorientation to renewal and rediscovered autonomy. The stories highlight that this life stage is not a fixed state but a fluid one, often involving boomerang children, new relationships, and the reimagining of personal identity and purpose.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The idea of "moral offsetting," where individuals donate to anti-factory farming charities to compensate for their meat consumption, is gaining popularity, exemplified by a recent successful fundraiser. Organizations like FarmKind propose this as a pragmatic alternative for consumers who feel guilty about eating meat but are unwilling to become vegetarian. The article explores the wonky math and ethical complexities of this approach, questioning whether it absolves personal responsibility or provides a practical way for a cash-strapped movement to effect change.</p>

          <p>Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the continent's reliance on imported vaccines, African nations are making strides toward building local manufacturing capacity. Projects are underway in South Africa, Senegal, Rwanda, and Kenya, with the goal of producing vaccines for diseases like malaria and yellow fever. Despite this progress and a renewed political commitment, Africa still produces only 0.1% of the world's vaccines and remains heavily dependent on imports. New funding initiatives aim to help local manufacturers become competitive by 2040.</p>

          <p>Ethel Caterham, a British woman recognized as the world's oldest living person, celebrated her 116th birthday on Thursday. Born in 1909, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII and has lived through two World Wars and the reigns of six British monarchs. Caterham, who resides in a care home in Surrey, marked the occasion quietly with her family. She inherited the title of world's oldest person earlier this year following the death of a 116-year-old Brazilian nun.</p>

          <p>In Kiruna, Sweden, the town's historic 113-year-old Lutheran church has been carefully transported three miles to a new location. The massive relocation is part of a multi-year project to move the entire town center. This extraordinary measure is necessary because the ground beneath the original town site has become unstable due to the expansion of a large, nearby iron-ore mine. The event marks a significant milestone in the ambitious and complex process of preserving the town's heritage while accommodating industrial growth.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, writer-director Alex Russell discusses his debut feature film, "Lurker," which explores the insidious relationship between a rising music star and an obsessive fan.

Russell, who has also written for TV shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," explains that he drew on his own experiences as an outsider to craft a story about the universal desire to belong.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have released new details of their trade agreement, confirming that pharmaceuticals and semiconductors will face a 15% tariff, not the much higher rates previously threatened by President Trump. This decision averts potential tariffs of up to 250% on these key sectors. In return for the U.S. lowering tariffs, the EU must first pass legislation to eliminate its own tariffs on U.S. industrial and agricultural goods, after which the U.S. will reduce its 27.5% tariff on European cars to 15%.

          <p>A new study published in Science Advances suggests that public wolf hunting in the Western U.S. is not an effective tool for reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzing data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington found that killing wolves had a minimal impact on cattle and sheep depredation. The study concluded that approximately 14 wolves would need to be killed to save a single cow, questioning the core logic behind many states' wolf management plans that promote hunting as a solution to human-wildlife conflict.</p>
