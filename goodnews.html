          <p>The United States and China have initiated a 90-day temporary trade deal, leading to reduced tariffs on imports between the two countries. This has prompted a surge in efforts to transport merchandise across the Pacific Ocean. Importers are rushing to take advantage of the lowered tariffs, though factory and shipping capacity constraints may lead to increased costs. The tariff reductions highlight the unpredictable nature of trade policies, especially concerning the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>
