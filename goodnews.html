          <p>In an interview, Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence in the imminent release of hostages as part of a U.S.-brokered peace deal between Israel and Hamas. He credited the Trump administration's non-traditional diplomatic approach for achieving what he described as being on the cusp of sustainable peace. Vance also addressed the ongoing government shutdown, placing blame on Senate Democrats and defending the administration's decision to lay off federal workers as a necessary consequence of managing limited resources. He characterized the Democrats' negotiating stance on healthcare policy as "hostage-taking."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>PepsiCo has announced significant changes to the recipes for its popular Doritos and Cheetos snacks, committing to removing all artificial flavors and colors. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services initiative to eliminate petroleum-based dyes like Red 40 and Yellow 6 from food products. In addition to the ingredient overhaul, the company plans to introduce a new line of protein-fortified Doritos and expand its use of avocado and olive oils in other products. The changes are largely driven by growing consumer demand for healthier, more natural food options.</p>

He defeated women's champion Mags Blake in the final round to claim the overall title. This year's event attracted heightened interest following a cheating scandal in the previous year, which organizers believe contributed to a rapid sell-out of competitor spots. The tournament proceeded despite initial fears of a conker shortage due to a dry summer, with donations from across Europe ensuring the games could go on.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has confirmed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of the Gaza peace plan. The summit, led by U.S. President Donald Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, follows a ceasefire agreement brokered by the U.S. While the UK government has asserted it played a key role in shaping the deal, this claim has been disputed by officials from the U.S. and Israel. At the summit, Starmer is expected to pay tribute to the mediating nations and offer the UK's support for the peace process.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-brokered peace plan for Gaza is set to enter its first phase with an exchange of hostages and prisoners between Israel and Hamas. This initial stage, which began with a ceasefire and increased aid, requires Hamas to release all remaining hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Subsequent phases, which remain to be negotiated, include the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of a transitional governing body. Significant challenges lie ahead, including Hamas's refusal to disarm and disagreements over the long-term governance of the territory and the extent of Israeli troop withdrawal.</p>

Speaking at a meeting of foreign ministers in Paris, Wadephul emphasized that any long-term plan must involve Israel and be guided by a United Nations mandate aimed at a two-state solution. This initiative is supported by Germany's ruling coalition, which views rebuilding Gaza as crucial for regional stability, security, and humanitarian reasons. However, the path forward faces diplomatic complexities, highlighted by Israel's criticism of the Paris conference.</p>
