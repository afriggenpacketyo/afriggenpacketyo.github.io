          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's fatal shooting, Utah's Republican Governor Spencer Cox delivered a public address calling for an end to political rage and division. Citing his "Disagree Better" initiative, Cox urged young Americans to embrace difficult conversations and reject violence as a political tool. The governor, known for his efforts to promote civility and bipartisan cooperation, framed the assassination as an attack on the fundamental American principle of free speech. His message of de-escalation stands in contrast to the increasingly polarized national political climate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a $125 million lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-sharing company of systematic discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The lawsuit alleges that Uber violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by refusing service to individuals with service animals or mobility devices, and improperly charging fees. This legal action follows a 2022 settlement where Uber compensated users for charging wait-time fees to disabled passengers. Uber has stated it disagrees with the allegations, asserting a zero-tolerance policy for service denials and driver training on accessibility laws.</p>

Karki, 73, is the first woman to lead the country and her appointment is part of a deal to quell the widespread unrest that saw over 50 people killed. The protests were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew into a mass movement against the political elite.

          <p>With a record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds, investors are watching closely as the Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates. While some on Wall Street predict this "wall of cash" will flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, others are more skeptical. Experts note that money fund assets have historically only declined when rates are near zero, and a minor rate cut is unlikely to prompt a mass exodus from these accounts. The funds have become a primary tool for institutional and corporate cash management, which is less sensitive to small rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to their lowest levels in nearly a year, prospective homebuyers are advised to remember several key strategies to capitalize on the opportunity. This article emphasizes that timing is critical, as lenders often adjust rates in anticipation of Federal Reserve actions, meaning the best rates may appear before an official cut. It also reiterates the importance of having a high credit score to qualify for the most favorable terms and securing a pre-approval to demonstrate seriousness to sellers. Finally, it suggests buyers prioritize finding the right home over waiting for the perfect rate, as refinancing is always a future option. (not investment advice)</p>
