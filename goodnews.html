          <h2>Japan's Gen Z Prioritizes Work-Life Balance, Embracing 'Quiet Quitting'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 01:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting a "quiet quitting" approach, prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that approximately 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with younger employees being the most likely to admit to this behavior. This shift in attitude is driven by a desire for more "me time," a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations, and a recognition that company loyalty no longer guarantees long-term job security. Experts suggest this change is a positive development, potentially leading to happier individuals and a healthier economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 7-5 in 13 innings, overcoming a blown save and a rain delay, but the game highlighted concerns about the team's pitching depth. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw was limited to two innings due to a rain delay, and the bullpen was heavily taxed, pitching 11 innings. Teoscar Hern√°ndez drove in the go-ahead run in the 13th inning, and Luis Garc√≠a closed out the game, but the Dodgers face a challenging stretch of games against playoff-contending teams with a depleted pitching staff, raising concerns about fatigue and future performance.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans for the government to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. The government intends to bypass auctions, allowing for more control over prices, and is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution. This move comes amid criticism that the government has not effectively curbed the recent spike in rice prices, which has hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, nearly double last year's level.</p>

Both steelmakers have welcomed the decision, emphasizing their commitment to American workers and the steel industry.

          <p>China has officially approved the construction of a 767-kilometer canal linking the resource-rich province of Jiangxi to the wealthy coastal province of Zhejiang. This Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, estimated to cost 320 billion yuan (US$44.4 billion), is part of a larger effort to expand China's inland waterway network. The canal aims to lower logistical costs and integrate less-developed inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. The canal will be able to accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually, connecting Jiangxi's rare earth and copper reserves to Zhejiang's seaports.</p>
