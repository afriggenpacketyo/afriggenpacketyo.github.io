          <p>Chinese sportswear firm Xtep International announced a record interim net profit of 913.6 million yuan, a 6.4% increase from the previous year, driven by a surge in running's popularity in China. The company's professional running brands, Saucony and Merrell, saw the most significant growth, with sales jumping 32.5% and operating profit more than tripling. This success validates Xtep's strategy of taking full control of the brands' distribution in China last year. The chairman noted that the company has effectively leveraged its presence in major marathon events to boost brand visibility and sales across both its high-end and mass-market segments.

          <p>A 47-year-old man from Liverpool has been banned from all football stadiums in the United Kingdom after being arrested for allegedly directing racist abuse at Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo. The incident occurred during a Premier League match at Anfield, causing the game to be briefly halted after Semenyo reported the abuse to the referee. Merseyside Police have conditionally bailed the man, with the ban being one of the conditions. Semenyo later posted on social media, thanking the football community for its unified support and praising the professional handling of the situation by officials and players from both teams.</p>

Despite a 4-0 loss, the event was met with jubilant celebration from fans, who were proud to see their nation represented.

          <p>A fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River has helped solve the nearly 60-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn, who went missing in 1967. The fisherman discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick and alerted authorities, who recovered the vehicle from the river in Sartell, Minnesota. Inside the severely deteriorated car, investigators found human remains and were able to identify the vehicle as belonging to Benn via its VIN. Authorities believe the remains are his and have notified his remaining family, bringing a potential resolution to a case that has been cold for decades.</p>

          <p>A writer reflects on the power of jewelry as a medium for self-expression and reinvention, inspired by a watch inherited from her grandmother. The essay posits that unlike clothing, which changes daily, accessories worn consistently become emblems of our identity, anchoring us through life's fluctuations. The grandmother, a woman who constantly reinvented herself, is remembered through her eclectic jewelry collection, each piece representing a different facet of her personality. The author concludes that these inherited items are not merely superficial adornments but talismans that connect generations and help shape one's own evolving sense of self.</p>

          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk surged after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class medication authorized for this serious and progressive liver condition, which affects a significant portion of U.S. adults. The approval expands the drug's applications beyond weight loss and diabetes, strengthening its position in the metabolic disease market. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the current conflict, following pressure from a cross-party group of MPs who warned of imminent deaths due to Gaza's devastated healthcare system. The children will be selected based on medical need and will travel with family members to the UK via a third country. Given the difficulties of returning to Gaza, it is anticipated that some may enter the asylum system after their treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is running in a crucial by-election in a rural Alberta riding to regain a seat in the House of Commons. Poilievre lost his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the last general election, sidelining him as new Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberal party enjoys a period of popularity. Although he is widely expected to win the safe Conservative riding, the margin of victory will be closely watched as a measure of his leadership strength ahead of a mandatory party review. The race is unusual for featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform.</p>
