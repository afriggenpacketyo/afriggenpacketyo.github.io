        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans are preparing to vote on revoking California's vehicle emissions waivers, which allow the state to set stricter standards than federal regulations. Democrats are calling the planned vote "the nuclear option", arguing that it is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent by overruling the Senate Parliamentarian. The waivers in question include those related to reducing tailpipe emissions and the "EV mandate" that aims to phase out gas-powered cars by 2035. California officials have vowed to sue if Congress revokes the waivers, which are supported by 16 other states and D.C.</p>

          <p>The Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks to Washington, D.C., for a military parade celebrating its 250th birthday, which coincides with President Trump's birthday. The parade, featuring tanks, fighting vehicles, aircraft, and reenactors, has drawn comparisons to Trump's previous attempt at a grand military display. The event is expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, with additional security expenses. The parade will trace the Army's evolution and conclude near the White House, where Trump will administer an oath to new Army recruits.</p>

          <p>Canada is in talks with the U.S. about joining its proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system, aimed at countering futuristic aerial threats. Prime Minister Markey Carney confirmed that "high level" discussions are taking place, though he declined to specify the potential cost or Canada's level of participation. The U.S. President Trump unveiled the $25 billion missile defense system, mentioning Canada's interest in joining the project. The "Golden Dome" is meant to target increasingly sophisticated aerial weapons, including hypersonic missiles, and will include space-based sensors and interceptors.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) regained control of their headquarters after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void." The ruling followed a lawsuit by USIP leaders after they were forcibly removed from their positions. The Justice Department plans to appeal the ruling, which deemed the ousting of the board and staff unlawful. USIP was established by Congress to provide analysis and resources for peace efforts worldwide and to reduce the chance of U.S. involvement in foreign conflicts.</p>
