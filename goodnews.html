        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a ¬£14.2 billion investment in the Sizewell C nuclear project, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasizing the project's role in creating 10,000 jobs and ensuring energy security for the country. The project aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources, particularly in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has driven up global gas and oil prices. However, the project faces opposition due to potential costs and environmental impacts, with completion expected in the mid-2030s. The government hopes the investment will attract further private funding, essential for the project to proceed, as part of a broader strategy to stimulate economic growth and tackle climate change.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account," where they make "deposits" through actions that prioritize their partner's happiness. This involves identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated, and then consistently acting on those insights. A positive balance in the account reflects a sense of security and allows couples to handle disagreements more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalating conflicts. The goal is to make more deposits than withdrawals, leading to less intense and frequent arguments, fostering a healthier and more enjoyable relationship. </p>
