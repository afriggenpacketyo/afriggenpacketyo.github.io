          <h2>New Book Argues Iranian Revolution Was a Contingent Event, Not Historical Inevitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 11:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," explores the argument that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was a product of historical contingency rather than an unavoidable outcome. The book focuses on the shah's hubris, U.S. obliviousness, and a series of miscalculations that allowed Ayatollah Khomeini to establish a theocratic dictatorship. Anderson posits that the revolution's success was largely an accident, shaped by the specific actions and inactions of key players in the months leading up to the event. This perspective challenges grand theories about Iranian culture or Islam being the sole drivers of the upheaval.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether buying an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, especially given current economic conditions. Purchasing an annuity at this age can provide a larger, guaranteed income stream for life, as insurers calculate higher payouts based on a shorter life expectancy. However, potential drawbacks include a lack of liquidity, as the principal is tied up, and the risk of not recouping the investment if one has health issues suggesting a shortened lifespan. The best decision depends on individual health, financial goals, and the need for predictable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Muhammad Yunus, the leader of Bangladesh's interim government, has announced that the country will hold its next general election in February 2026. This will be the first election since a mass uprising led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in the previous year. In a broadcast marking the one-year anniversary of Hasina's removal, Yunus confirmed that his caretaker government would transfer power to an elected body following the vote. The announcement marks a significant step in the country's political transition.</p>

The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a reduction in the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. While pass rates for National 5 and Highers are returning to pre-pandemic levels, Advanced Higher results remain slightly lower. Alongside the academic results, a record number of young Scots have been offered university or college placements, marking a positive development for the education sector.</p>

Management also reaffirmed the timeline for spinning off its electronics business, Qnity, which is seen as a positive catalyst due to its connection to the AI and semiconductor industries.

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 14.9% drop in murder and nonnegligent manslaughter and a 4.5% overall decrease in violent crime. Property crimes also saw a significant decline, with motor vehicle thefts falling by 18.6%. While experts note this continues a downward trend from a post-pandemic spike, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain high and that many crimes go unreported to police.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For Americans struggling with significant credit card debt, debt settlement, or forgiveness, can be a viable option. Financial experts advise that to qualify, individuals typically need over $7,500 in unsecured debt and must be able to document a clear financial hardship, such as job loss or medical crisis. The first steps include organizing all financial documents and accessing credit reports to get a full picture of one's debt. When negotiating with creditors, either directly or through a reputable firm, it is crucial to get any final settlement agreement in writing to ensure the terms are legally binding.

The list includes damaged canned goods, which can harbor the botulinum toxin, and certain large tropical reef fish that may contain ciguatoxin, both potent neurotoxins. The expert also advises against consuming undercooked pork due to the risk of neurocysticercosis, a parasitic infection that can cause seizures. Finally, the article warns against unpasteurized milk, a known source of dangerous pathogens that can lead to severe and irreversible brain damage, meningitis, or coma.</p>
