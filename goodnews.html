          <p>The 60th annual World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire, UK, has crowned a new champion, first-time contender Matt Cross from Lincolnshire. After a cheating scandal brought increased attention to last year's event, hundreds of competitors participated in the quirky tournament. Cross defeated the women's victor, Mags Blake, in a final showdown to claim the overall title. The event nearly faced cancellation due to a shortage of quality conkers from a dry summer, but donations, including from the royal estate at Windsor, ensured the competition could proceed.</p>

          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a defensively dominated game held in London, extending their winning streak to three games. The Jets' offense struggled immensely, managing only 82 total net yards and allowing nine sacks on quarterback Justin Fields. Despite their offensive woes, the Jets briefly took the lead in the third quarter after a safety. However, a late 27-yard field goal by Denver's Wil Lutz proved decisive, sealing the win and leaving the Jets with a winless 0-6 record for the season.</p>

          <p>Downing Street has announced that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer will attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, to mark the signing of the Gaza peace plan. Starmer is expected to pay tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in brokering the deal and will call for swift progress toward the next phase of the truce. The UK's participation has drawn some criticism, with an Israeli official suggesting British actions had previously emboldened Hamas, though a UK minister asserted the nation played a key role behind the scenes.</p>

This initiative is framed within a broader political context aimed at establishing a two-state solution and ensuring Israel's long-term security. The proposal has received support from Germany's ruling coalition, citing humanitarian, security, and migration policy reasons, though it faces challenges, as an Israeli minister criticized a related preparatory meeting in Paris as "unnecessary and harmful."</p>
