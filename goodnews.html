          <p>President Donald Trump has commenced his second state visit to the United Kingdom, a historic occasion as he is the first modern elected leader to be hosted twice by a British monarch. He and the first lady were officially welcomed by King Charles III and other senior royals at Windsor Castle with significant pomp and ceremony, including a large guard of honor and a military flypast. The visit is intended to reinforce the "special relationship" between the two nations ahead of the 250th anniversary of the United States' founding. The itinerary includes a formal state banquet and a subsequent meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss policy matters.</p>

          <p>While President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom features extensive royal pageantry, including a carriage procession and state banquet at Windsor Castle, it has also been met with public controversy. Four individuals were arrested for projecting an image of Trump with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein onto the castle walls, highlighting ongoing public scrutiny. Protests against the president's policies have been organized, contrasting with supporters who also gathered to welcome him. The visit, which involves extensive security measures, underscores the dual nature of his reception in the UK: official diplomatic warmth combined with visible public dissent and criticism.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh has made baseball history by hitting his 55th and 56th home runs of the season in a single game against the Kansas City Royals. His first homer of the night broke Mickey Mantle's 1961 record for the most home runs in a season by a switch-hitter. In the following inning, Raleigh hit another home run, tying Ken Griffey Jr.'s franchise record for single-season homers. Raleigh, who leads the major leagues in home runs, expressed humility about the achievement, stating his name shouldn't be mentioned alongside legends like Mantle and Griffey Jr. The Mariners are currently leading the American League West division.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United Reports Record Financial Revenue Despite Team's Poor Performance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 07:29:16 EDT</div>

          <p>Manchester United has announced record financial revenues of £666.5 million for the last fiscal year, despite the men's team's disappointing 15th-place finish in the Premier League. The club's commercial success was driven by a new front-of-shirt sponsorship deal with Snapdragon, which contributed to record commercial and matchday revenues. This financial performance allowed the club to significantly reduce its overall losses by over 70% compared to the previous year. The club's chief executive, Omar Berrada, highlighted the organization's resilience and stated that efforts are underway to improve all areas of the club for long-term success.</p>

          <h2>Sharp Drop in Interest Rates Leads to 58% Surge in Mortgage Refinance Applications</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates to their lowest level since last October has triggered a massive increase in demand for home loan refinancing. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance surged by 58% last week and were 70% higher than the same period last year. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.39%, prompting many homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek lower monthly payments. In contrast, applications for mortgages to purchase a new home saw a more modest increase of 3%, suggesting the rate drop has been more impactful for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs rookie pitcher Cade Horton delivered another strong performance, leading his team to a 4-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his last 11 starts, Horton has an impressive 8-1 record and has allowed only six runs. This accomplishment puts him in elite company, as he is the first pitcher since Hall of Famer Bob Gibson in his dominant 1968 season to record at least eight wins while allowing six or fewer runs over an 11-start span. The win improves the Cubs' record to 87-64 as they continue their push for a playoff spot in the National League.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is finalizing its transition to electronic payments for Social Security and other federal benefits, with a mandate set to take effect this month. The move, aimed at reducing costs and preventing fraud associated with paper checks, will require most beneficiaries to receive their funds via direct deposit or a Treasury-sponsored debit card. While the vast majority of recipients already use electronic methods, the change could present challenges for individuals who are unbanked, disabled, or live in remote areas. The Treasury Department has established a waiver process for those who may qualify to continue receiving paper checks under specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the chaotic and brief 1998 marriage between NBA star Dennis Rodman and model Carmen Electra, contrasting their unconventional relationship with more mainstream modern celebrity pairings like Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. It frames the Rodman-Electra union as a "neon fever dream" that appealed to misfits and outsiders, celebrating their defiance of norms in fashion, gender expression, and race. The author argues that their provocative and turbulent romance represented a different kind of celebrity spectacle, one that was less polished and more rebellious than today's algorithm-friendly love stories. The piece explores how their visibility challenged cultural conventions during a distinct media era.</p>

          <p>Following Germany's recent EuroBasket championship victory, the country is celebrating a golden era for its national basketball program. However, this success is shadowed by concerns over the changing landscape of player development due to the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policies in U.S. college sports. The article explains that the significant money now available to student-athletes in the NCAA is attracting top young German talent away from domestic leagues like the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL). While this offers individual players valuable experience, German basketball officials worry about the long-term impact and are seeking ways to receive compensation for developing players who leave for the U.S. college system.</p>

          <p>Joel Willett, a former CIA officer whose security clearance was recently revoked by the Trump administration, has announced his candidacy as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate seat in Kentucky currently held by Mitch McConnell. Willett was one of 37 intelligence officials targeted in a recent purge, an act he describes as a "nakedly political" attempt to silence dissent. He states that this experience strengthened his resolve to run, citing concerns about the weaponization of government against political opponents. Willett's campaign will focus on issues including economic inequality and the fentanyl crisis, which has personally affected his family.</p>
