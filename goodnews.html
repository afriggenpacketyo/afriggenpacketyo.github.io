          <p>A psychologist and mother-to-be critiques what she terms "therapy culture," which promotes the idea that a mother's every action can have lasting psychological consequences for her child. The article challenges the scientific basis of this pressure, citing research that suggests parenting has less deterministic influence on a child's adult traits compared to genetics and peer groups. It argues that this focus on achieving psychological perfection creates immense guilt and anxiety for mothers, diverting attention from the lack of structural supports like affordable childcare and paid leave. The author advocates for a shift away from obsessive self-scrutiny toward addressing these larger societal issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from a series of international correspondent snapshots reflects on the cultural and social importance of the banyan tree in India. The author describes how these sprawling trees serve as central gathering places, offering shade and a space for rest, prayer, and play in both Hindu and Muslim communities. Accompanied by a photograph from a village in Gujarat, the piece highlights a scene of men resting in the heat near a banyan tree, contrasting their stillness with the labor of women carrying water nearby. The tree is presented as a life-giving and revered symbol woven into the fabric of daily life.</p>

The tech giant is committing an additional $100 billion, bringing its total planned U.S. investment to $600 billion over the next four years. This new pledge includes the creation of an "American Manufacturing Program" aimed at expanding Apple's domestic production capabilities. The event follows President Trump's persistent calls for Apple to move its manufacturing from countries like China and India back to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has rejoined first-team training after holding constructive discussions with the club, though he still hopes to secure a transfer to Newcastle United. Relations had been strained after Wissa left the team's pre-season training camp in July to push for the move, which would offer him Champions League football. While talks have eased the immediate conflict, sources indicate Brentford will only consider a sale for a price significantly higher than Newcastle's current offer of £25 million plus add-ons. The club's ability to find a suitable replacement before the transfer deadline is also a key factor in any potential deal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elaine Castillo's new novel, "Moderation," is reviewed as a powerful examination of modern emotional life through the lens of a tech worker. The story follows Girlie Delmundo, a Filipino immigrant's daughter who becomes a content moderator for a major tech company to support her family, forcing her to view horrific material daily. The review highlights how the novel uses its protagonist's sharp wit and stoicism as a coping mechanism for both professional trauma and personal grief. As Girlie navigates her grim job and a budding romance, the book explores how technology provides new ways to dissociate from feelings, reflecting a world where people increasingly hide from themselves.</p>

          <p>An unexploded 250-kg British bomb from World War II was successfully defused in the eastern German city of Dresden, requiring a massive public safety operation. Approximately 17,000 people were evacuated from a wide area, which included famous landmarks like the Frauenkirche, after the bomb was discovered during demolition work on a bridge. Unexploded ordnance from the war is still regularly found across Germany, often necessitating large-scale evacuations.

          <p>ESPN has acquired the exclusive streaming rights for WWE's major live events, including WrestleMania, in a five-year deal valued at approximately $1.6 billion. Starting in 2026, the events will move from NBCUniversal's Peacock to ESPN's new direct-to-consumer streaming service, which launches this month. The deal nearly doubles the previous rights fee and is part of ESPN's strategy to attract a broader, more diverse, and younger audience to its new platform. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro noted that the consistent schedule of WWE's marquee events will also help with subscriber retention throughout the year.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are declining in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West, offering modest relief in a tight housing market. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops from their 2022 peaks, with median listing prices falling nearly 15% and 19% respectively. This trend is attributed to higher housing inventory in these areas, partly due to a pandemic-era construction boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face sticky high prices and limited inventory, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing prices climb significantly.

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning the Amadea, a 348-foot superyacht seized from a sanctioned Russian billionaire as part of a task force targeting oligarchs after the invasion of Ukraine. The vessel, valued at over $300 million, features a helipad, pool, and cinema. To place a bid in the September 10 auction, potential buyers must have a net worth of at least $500 million and provide a $10 million deposit. A holding company tied to the yacht disputes its ownership by the sanctioned individual, claiming it belongs to another non-sanctioned Russian, but this claim has been rejected by the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Lee Castleton, a former sub-postmaster and a prominent victim of the Horizon IT scandal, is suing the Post Office and Fujitsu for more than £4 million in damages. Court documents reveal a detailed claim for past and future financial losses, as well as damages for mental distress and malicious bankruptcy, after he was wrongly pursued for £25,000 in 2007. Castleton, who was bankrupted by the original legal costs, is the first individual to take legal action against both organizations. His legal team alleges that the Post Office and Fujitsu conspired to pervert the course of justice by deliberately withholding evidence about the faulty software.</p>
