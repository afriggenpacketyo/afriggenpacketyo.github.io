          <p>Female refugees in Germany face significant challenges entering the workforce, with unemployment rates much higher than their male counterparts due to a "threefold disadvantage" of being women, immigrants, and refugees. The article highlights systemic issues like childcare shortages, difficulty in getting foreign qualifications recognized, and language barriers that disproportionately affect women, many of whom arrive with children. It profiles several women and the nonprofit organizations like "Work for Refugees" that are helping them overcome these obstacles through counseling, training, and mentorship, aiming to dismantle recruitment hurdles and foster integration.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell demonstrated a return to his Cy Young-winning form, striking out 10 batters over five scoreless innings in a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays. After a four-month recovery from a shoulder injury, Snell's performance signals that the Dodgers' formidable starting rotation is finally materializing as envisioned. The offense provided strong support, including Shohei Ohtani's 40th home run of the season. With Snell, Tyler Glasnow, and others now healthy and performing well, the team is building significant momentum as it heads towards the postseason.</p>

While standing in street clothes on the edge of the sideline, Lamb was accidentally leveled from behind by a sprinting official who was watching the play on the field. The collision resulted in a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty against the Cowboys for making contact with an official. Lamb appeared uninjured and was seen laughing about the incident with teammates, but the penalty negated part of a long gain for Dallas.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' 31-21 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, several new players made a strong case for larger roles this season. Rookie running back Blake Corum was particularly impressive, rushing for 32 yards and two touchdowns, suggesting he could effectively share the workload with starter Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also played with confidence, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns. The game highlighted the Rams' emerging depth at key offensive positions as they prepare for the upcoming regular season.</p>

          <h2>'Loud Luxury' Fashion Makes a Resurgence as Brands Seek to Revitalize Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "quiet luxury" trend of subtle, understated fashion is giving way to a "loud luxury" comeback, characterized by bold branding and statement designs. Ailing high-end brands like Gucci and Burberry are making this shift to inject novelty and reignite consumer desire amid slowing sales and soft consumer sentiment. This sartorial shake-up, driven by new creative directors and leadership changes, aims to reverse the fortunes of brands that struggled while ultra-luxe, discrete labels like Hermes thrived. Analysts suggest this move could be a turning point for the industry, which is also grappling with post-pandemic price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for "functional beverages" that promise to induce calm and relaxation is booming, but nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical of their advertised benefits. These drinks often contain supplements like Lion's Mane, L-theanine, and Ashwagandha, but experts say the quantities are likely too small to have a significant physiological effect. One brand, Trip, recently had an ad banned for making unsubstantiated health claims about stress and anxiety. A psychologist suggests that the feeling of calm may be a placebo effect, created by the ritual of setting aside time for a perceived treat.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last remaining newspaper hawker in France, is set to be awarded the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in Paris's Left Bank, selling papers on the streets of Saint-Germain. He has witnessed the decline of his trade from a thriving community of hawkers to being the sole survivor in the digital age, yet he continues for the joy and independence of the job. President Emmanuel Macron, who once bought papers from him as a student, will present the award.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman commented on the "crazy intense" competition for top AI talent, where tech giants are offering massive compensation packages to a very small pool of engineers. He explained that the industry is betting that a "medium-sized handful of people" possess the unique knowledge to discover the final algorithmic ideas needed to create superintelligence. While companies are focused on poaching a few big names with offers reportedly exceeding $100 million per year, Altman believes the actual pool of capable individuals is much larger, potentially in the tens of thousands, and not limited to the few currently being pursued.</p>
