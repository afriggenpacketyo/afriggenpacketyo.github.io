          <p>Health organizations across the globe have strongly refuted the Trump administration's recent claims connecting acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. Agencies from the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Australia issued statements reaffirming the drug's safety for pregnant women, citing a lack of new evidence to warrant a change in recommendations. International health experts emphasized that robust scientific studies, including a major Swedish study of 2.5 million children, show no causal link between paracetamol and neurodevelopmental disorders. The global consensus underscores that the administration's announcement is based on misinformation, not scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>Actress Scarlett Johansson is making her directorial debut with the new film "Eleanor the Great," starring 95-year-old June Squibb in a leading role. Squibb portrays a 94-year-old woman who moves to New York City after her best friend's death and inadvertently gets involved in a lie with a Holocaust survivors' support group. Johansson, who has wanted to direct since she was 12, feels the project came at the right time in her career, allowing her to apply her extensive acting experience. Squibb praised Johansson's leadership on set, highlighting a positive and collaborative production experience for the film.</p>

During their visit, Prince William and Catherine spoke with teachers and pupils at the schools the girls attended and praised the community's resilience, exemplified by a new memorial playground. Prince William paid tribute to the pastoral work of the school staff and the grace of the bereaved parents, promising continued support for those impacted by the tragedy.</p>

The dog went into a total panic, making it impossible for Friedman to get him home safely on the slippery sidewalks. A man named Blake noticed their distress, first offering to help walk the dog home and then, when that failed, driving them both home in his car. Friedman expressed immense gratitude for the help from Blake and his friend Bubba, calling them "angels" who rescued her and her dog from a dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500, a list of 500 of the largest U.S. public companies, is not just a market barometer but also a significant source of revenue for its creator, S&P Global. The company earns hundreds of millions annually by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial products like index funds and ETFs, which have trillions of dollars in assets. The index's dominance is attributed to its trusted brand, economies of scale, and its role as a common language for benchmarking investment performance, creating a strong "moat" against competitors. Recently, the index has faced criticism for being heavily weighted towards a few tech giants, raising questions about its diversification for investors.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, its most affordable level in three years, providing relief for homebuyers. For a $350,000 mortgage, this new rate translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128 per month. This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments at the start of the year when rates were above 7%, saving a borrower over $75,000 in total interest over the life of the loan. The lower rates have also spurred an increase in refinancing applications, offering existing homeowners a chance to reduce their monthly costs.</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer indicated he is considering taking profits on one of the Investing Club's bank stock holdings as the sector experiences a significant rally. Shares of major banks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have been trending higher, driven by the expectation of continued interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Portfolio director Jeff Marks noted that while megacap tech stocks have been driving overall market gains, the average stock has not performed as well, keeping the S&P 500 in a balanced, non-overbought state. The discussion highlighted the strategy of managing winning positions in a strong market environment. (not investment advice)</p>

While the financial terms were not disclosed, the move provides the USL with significant backing from a high-profile finance executive.

This will be the first crewed lunar mission in over 50 years and serves as a critical test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The crew will not land but will travel further into space than any previous mission, testing life-support and navigation systems in preparation for a future lunar landing. The mission's success is crucial for the subsequent Artemis III mission, which aims to return humans to the Moon's surface.</p>

          <p>A young male moose nicknamed Emil, who gained thousands of social media followers while roaming across central Europe, has been safely captured in Austria. The moose, believed to have traveled from Poland or the Czech Republic, was tranquilized near a busy motorway after spending the summer on his odyssey. Wildlife officials fitted Emil with a GPS tag and released him near the Czech Sumava national park, which has an existing moose population. The incident has sparked debate in Austria about wildlife protection and the need for better wildlife corridors along major transportation routes to prevent such situations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It has been nearly 30 years since a German footballer, Matthias Sammer in 1996, won the Ballon d'Or, the sport's top individual honor. An analysis suggests several reasons for this drought, despite Germany's continued success at the club and national levels. One key factor is that the award has overwhelmingly favored attacking players, and Germany has not produced strikers on par with historical legends like Gerd Müller. Furthermore, the era was dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who won the award almost exclusively for 15 years. With their dominance waning, there is hope for young German talents like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz to contend for the prize.</p>

These archives create 'snapshots' of web pages at specific moments, which can be crucial for fact-checkers, researchers, and the public to track how information and statements from public figures evolve over time. While not all content can be saved, these tools challenge the notion that what is deleted from the internet is gone forever.</p>
