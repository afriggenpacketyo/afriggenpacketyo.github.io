          <h2>New York City Ends Land Acquisition Program in Catskills Watershed</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 13:52:04 EDT</div>

          <p>New York City has ceased its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which began in 1997 to protect the city's drinking water supply by purchasing land in the watershed. The city acquired over 156,000 acres to prevent pollution and avoid costly filtration, but the program faced resistance from local communities due to restrictions on development. An independent review concluded further land purchases would have minimal benefit, leading to a focus on a new Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, requiring local approval for land use and balancing environmental protection with community needs. This article highlights the shift towards a more collaborative approach to watershed management and the challenges of balancing urban needs with rural interests, also noting concerns about gentrification impacting local residents.</p>

          <p>France's former interior minister, G√©rald Darmanin, has apologized to Liverpool fans for wrongly blaming them for the chaos at the 2022 Champions League final at the Stade de France. Darmanin admitted that security arrangements were inadequate and his initial remarks blaming English fans were a mistake, acknowledging that the real problem stemmed from delinquents robbing fans. Police had used tear gas on Liverpool supporters, and some fans were mugged by gangs. Darmanin called the night the biggest failure of his career, explaining that security was designed for football hooligans rather than muggers, marking a significant shift in accountability for the event.</p>
