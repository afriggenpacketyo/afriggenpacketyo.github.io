        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial criticism, the FIFA Club World Cup has proven to be a financial success, prompting discussions about its future expansion. FIFA President Gianni Infantino's vision was vindicated by a $1 billion prize fund that attracted top clubs, with suggestions the tournament could expand to 48 teams in 2029 or even be held biennially. The event generated significant revenue and high viewership, particularly in Brazil, validating the investment from broadcaster Dazn. However, concerns about player welfare amid a packed schedule remain a significant, unresolved issue for players' unions and domestic leagues.</p>

          <p>This archival article from July 16, 2005, reports on the addition of Macau's historic center to the UNESCO World Heritage list. The designation, which included 29 sites, was seen as a significant boost to Macau's efforts to diversify its image beyond being just a gambling destination. The landmarks, celebrated for their role in the early encounters between Eastern and Western cultures, joined prestigious sites like China's Great Wall. At the time, Macau's chief executive, Edmund Ho Hau-wah, described the collection of sites, which feature unique Portuguese-style buildings on Chinese soil, as a "peerless jewel" for the region.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Updates Sex Education to Include Anti-Misogyny and Online Dangers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 02:41:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update the relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) curriculum to address contemporary issues like misogyny, consent, and the dangers of AI-generated deepfakes. The curriculum will teach students to identify positive male role models and understand unhealthy online influences, such as incel culture. Unlike a previous draft, the new guidance will not impose strict age limits for topics but will outline what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school. The changes, which also emphasize parental consultation, aim to better equip students to navigate the modern world safely.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated Summer League game, Bronny James delivered one of his strongest performances, scoring 17 points with five rebounds and five assists for the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite his impressive showing, which drew a crowd of sports dignitaries including his father LeBron James, the Lakers fell to the Los Angeles Clippers 67-58. James demonstrated growing confidence, particularly with his shooting, but the Lakers struggled as a team with poor shooting percentages and numerous turnovers. Clippers forward Jordan Miller was the star of the game, scoring 19 points and leading his team to victory.</p>

          <p>To encourage the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is introducing a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric cars. The grants, funded by a £650 million scheme, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and will be available for three years. While the government hopes this will make EVs more affordable, critics and industry experts point out that the lack of public charging infrastructure remains a major barrier. With only 82,000 public charging points currently available, there are concerns the country is not ready for a mass shift to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to resume selling its H20 artificial intelligence chip to China, a product previously halted by U.S. export controls. The company stated it is filing for the necessary licenses and has been assured by the U.S. government that they will be granted. This move comes as Nvidia faces increased competition from Chinese tech firms like Huawei and after the export ban cost the company an estimated $15 billion in sales. In addition to resuming H20 sales, Nvidia is also introducing a new, less powerful AI chip tailored to be fully compliant with U.S. regulations for the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's remarkable success over the past year is being credited to his work with renowned putting coach Phil Kenyon. Before collaborating with Kenyon, Scheffler was statistically one of the worst putters on the PGA Tour despite being the best from tee to green. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a crucial switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the turning point. Within a year, Scheffler transformed his putting performance, leading to a dominant season that included seven wins, a second Masters title, and an Olympic gold medal.</p>

          <p>Mainland China is on track to issue a record number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) this year, driven by favorable regulations and strong investor demand. In the first half of 2025, Chinese fund managers launched 166 new ETFs, already more than half of the all-time high of 277 set in 2021. This surge is part of a broader global trend and is supported by streamlined approval processes and reduced fees in China. The majority of these new funds track domestic stock indexes, with others focusing on bonds and overseas markets, reflecting growing investor appetite for diversified, exchange-traded products.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily intervened to maintain protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans, preventing their potential deportation. The Trump administration had moved to end their Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which allows them to live and work in the U.S. legally. An immigrant advocacy group sued the administration over the decision, and while a lower court judge allowed the lawsuit to proceed, they did not halt the revocation. The appeals court has now issued a one-week stay, keeping the protections in place while it considers the case, providing a brief reprieve for the affected individuals.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with EVs now accounting for over 93% of new car sales in 2025. This success is attributed to a long-term strategy of strong government incentives, including VAT exemptions, reduced taxes, and access to bus lanes, combined with high taxes on polluting vehicles. The country has also invested heavily in a robust public charging infrastructure, with over 10,000 fast chargers now available nationwide. This comprehensive approach has made EVs a common sight, improving air quality and reducing noise in cities like Oslo.</p>

The development will feature homes, offices, and schools built using cross-laminated timber, a sustainable alternative to steel and concrete. The project aims to showcase sustainable urban development, as timber construction has a significantly lower carbon footprint. Architects and developers note that building with wood is also faster and creates aesthetically pleasing environments, which they believe will make the new district highly attractive to residents and businesses.</p>
