          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka attended a federal court status conference following his arrest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. Baraka was taken into custody on trespassing charges while supporting members of New Jersey's congressional delegation touring the facility, which he and others claim lacks necessary permits. U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba stated Baraka ignored warnings to leave, while Baraka maintains he was invited inside and did not trespass. He was held for four hours before being released, and the trespassing charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article discusses the rise in popularity of 'Earlybirds Club,' a roving dance party catering to women who prefer to dance in the early evening and be home before traditional nightclubs even open. Founded by two Gen Xers in Chicago, the club provides a safe, judgment-free zone for women, trans, and nonbinary people to enjoy pop anthems from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. The gatherings provide a sense of community and liberation for attendees, many of whom are mothers or caregivers seeking a break from their daily routines. One of the founders, Susie Lee, is battling stage IV breast cancer, which motivates the crowd to dance harder and embrace the joy of the moment.</p>

          <p>Walmart cautioned that even with recent tariff reductions on Chinese imports, the company may need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that the tariffs create cost pressures, particularly in categories like electronics and toys. Despite efforts to absorb some costs, the retailer anticipates price hikes later this month. CFO John David Rainey warned that a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels could significantly impact financials and jeopardize earnings growth. The warning comes amid concerns about consumer spending and potential economic impact from ongoing trade policy uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after growing more than expected in the first three months of the year, according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The 0.7% growth in the January-to-March period was "very encouraging," but shadow chancellor Mel Stride said it was "a bit premature to be popping the champagne corks." The growth was helped by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warned the strong rate of growth was unlikely to continue due to US tariffs and increased employer taxes. The Bank of England lowered UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and hinted more cuts could follow in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The UK is in discussions with other countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for failed asylum seekers, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The government is exploring sending asylum seekers abroad for processing after their claims have been rejected in the UK. The proposals are focused on countries in the western Balkans, but Albania has stated it is not part of the talks. This differs from the previous Conservative government's Rwanda scheme, which was scrapped by Starmer.</p>
