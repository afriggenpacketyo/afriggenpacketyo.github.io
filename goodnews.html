          <p>The United States and South Korea have solidified significant economic and defense agreements, featuring South Korean companies' $150 billion investment pledge in the U.S. and Korean Air committing nearly $50 billion to purchase Boeing aircraft and GE engines. These deals, encompassing energy cooperation to develop Alaska's natural gas reserves, aim to bolster U.S. manufacturing and strengthen bilateral trade relations. During the summit, President Trump also expressed a desire to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un this year, indicating a potential for renewed diplomatic engagement on the Korean Peninsula. This article highlights the comprehensive nature of these partnerships, which build upon a previous trade agreement that lowered U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports and underscores a deepening strategic alliance between the two nations.</p>

Playing on the 28th anniversary of her US Open debut at Arthur Ashe Stadium, Williams demonstrated her enduring passion and skill, despite recent struggles with fibroids that previously impacted her health and performance. The article notes her improved physical condition after surgery, allowing her to compete without pain, a key motivation for her continued play. Williams expressed pride in her performance and has not ruled out competing next year, though she prefers tournaments in the U.S.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad, following an earlier scrub for an oxygen leak. This milestone mission is critical for testing numerous fixes and upgrades after three previous catastrophic failures, aiming to clear the way for a faster launch cadence. A successful flight would accelerate SpaceX's plans for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, essential for NASA's Artemis moon landing program by 2027 and future Mars missions. Despite challenges and skepticism from some experts regarding the 2027 moon landing timeline, SpaceX remains confident in achieving its ambitious goals, leveraging its rapid development and testing approach.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is currently located in the central Atlantic Ocean, approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, and is expected to continue weakening over the next couple of days. Forecasters predict the storm will become a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating by Wednesday, posing no threat to land. Fernand, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, is the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar area. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had forecast an above-normal hurricane season this year, predicting 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine expected to become hurricanes.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung successfully employed a strategy of flattery during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, aiming to avert potential criticism despite Trump's earlier social media post regarding South Korea's internal affairs. Lee praised Trump's rapport with Kim Jong Un, positioning him as a potential "peacemaker" for the Korean Peninsula and even joking about a "Trump Tower in North Korea." While the meeting saw some economic agreements, such as the Korean Air deal, it yielded no concrete resolutions on broader trade tariffs or defense spending issues, which were high on Seoul's agenda. The article highlights Lee's primary goal was to ensure he left the Oval Office on Trump's good side, emphasizing the personal dynamics in international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have successfully performed a pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's feasibility and offering hope for addressing the global organ shortage. The genetically modified pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours (nine days) without signs of hyperacute rejection or uncontrolled infection. This breakthrough, detailed in a study from Guangzhou, is a significant advancement in xenotransplantation, a field that has seen recent progress in heart and kidney transplants. The article emphasizes that lung xenotransplantation presents distinct challenges due to its anatomical complexity and direct contact with the outside air, making this sustained functionality particularly noteworthy.</p>

A July 28 article in Nature Communications details the team's continued development of an "insect robot factory," which has improved the robotic cockroach's turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees. This enhanced precise control was verified through a series of experiments. The article highlights the potential for these "insect-computer hybrid robots" to significantly reduce mass production time and cost, thereby opening doors for practical applications in emergency response and search-and-rescue operations.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Utah has ruled that the state's current congressional map, drawn in 2021, is unlawful and must be redrawn for the 2026 midterm elections. The judge found that the Republican-controlled legislature violated voters' rights by circumventing an independent commission established to ensure non-partisan district boundaries. The existing map had divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among the state's four congressional districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans by wide margins.

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This move addresses the Raiders' urgent need for a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell suffered a wrist injury, sidelining him for 6-8 weeks. Pickett, who has 25 NFL starts, previously backed up Jalen Hurts during the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory last season. His departure leaves the Browns' backup quarterback role wide open, with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders competing behind starter Joe Flacco, especially after Pickett's training camp hamstring injury.

Second, focus on building core and back strength through regular exercises, rather than striving for stiffness, noting that simple movements can lift tension. Finally, address mindset, recognizing that stress and emotional factors significantly contribute to back pain, and sometimes easing one's schedule is as important as physical adjustments.</p>
