          <p>England's cricket team has announced its 16-man squad for the Ashes 2025 series against Australia, with Will Jacks receiving a surprise recall as the back-up spinner. Harry Brook has been elevated to vice-captain, a move that could intensify debate over Ollie Pope's position at number three. The squad includes a strong pace-bowling lineup, despite injury concerns for key players like Mark Wood, who has not played a Test in 15 months. The team aims to maintain loyalty in selection under coach Brendon McCullum, hoping for a successful tour down under.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Increased SALT Deduction Limit Offers Significant Tax Savings in High-Tax States</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's 'big beautiful bill' temporarily raises the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for 2025. This change is expected to provide substantial tax benefits, particularly for homeowners in high-tax states such as New York, California, and New Jersey. While the benefit phases out for higher earners, it represents a notable increase from the previous cap imposed in 2017. The article highlights that these savings are a simulation based on various assumptions, and actual benefits may vary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, which posed a significant threat to the city's telecom systems, particularly during the UN General Assembly. Investigators discovered 300 SIM servers containing over 100,000 SIM cards in abandoned buildings, capable of sending millions of text messages per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers. Early analysis indicates the network facilitated communication among foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and human trafficking rings. The ongoing investigation, launched after telephonic threats to U.S. officials, has yet to result in arrests.</p>
