          <p>Singapore experienced a cooler-than-expected inflation rate in July, dropping to 0.6%, its lowest point since January 2021. This figure was below economists' forecasts and June's 0.8%, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has already eased monetary policy twice this year, anticipating a global trade slowdown and projecting lower core inflation for 2025. The nation faces potential weaker growth and trade tensions, including a baseline tariff on exports to the U.S. from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group surged to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private in a deal valued at approximately $7 billion. The company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. This restructuring aligns with China's efforts to consolidate its automotive sector and enhance competitiveness. Despite a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed 33%, with VOYAH series sales soaring 84.8%.</p>

          <p>SpaceX rescheduled its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from Starbase, Texas, after encountering an issue with ground systems during fueling. This comes after three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures, with this test aiming to evaluate numerous upgrades and deliberately stress the vehicle. The flight plan included a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf and for Starship in the Indian Ocean, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and performing an in-space engine restart. The Starship program is crucial for launching next-generation Starlinks and NASA's Artemis moon missions, with the latter requiring 10-20 successful refueling flights.</p>

This widespread optimism followed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals at Jackson Hole, indicating a potential easing of monetary policy next month. Mainland China's CSI 300 also extended gains to a 37-month high. Analysts suggest maturing time deposits could shift into equities, and Fed rate cuts might trigger capital rotation from the U.S. to China, driving recent market momentum across the region.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani displayed an unexpected moment of sportsmanship by high-fiving a heckling San Diego Padres fan after hitting his 45th home run of the season. The gesture occurred during the ninth inning of the Dodgers' 8-2 victory, amusing fans and his manager, Dave Roberts, who noted it was "very out of character" for Ohtani. Known as a "unicorn" for his elite pitching and hitting, Ohtani's interaction defused the intense rivalry between the teams, which has seen previous incidents of fan misconduct and on-field altercations.</p>

          <p>China's central bank set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, reacting to growing bets on Federal Reserve rate cuts. This move by the People’s Bank of China follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference, signaling a potential interest rate cut in September. The offshore yuan also climbed to its strongest level since late July, reflecting market confidence in the Fed's easing stance. Analysts now consider a September rate cut by the Federal Reserve almost certain.</p>

Cramer advises investors to focus on housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs, with specific stock recommendations like Toll Brothers and Goldman Sachs.
