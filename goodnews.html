          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 17:30:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Middle and major powers are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology to exert influence, reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik. This approach, while agile and ambiguous, carries risks of entanglements that could escalate instability, requiring leaders to balance relationships between multiple powers without fully committing to any single one. This strategy, exemplified by Henry Kissinger's approach in the 1970s, aims to prevent adversaries from uniting against a nation by fostering closer ties with multiple powers while maintaining strategic ambiguity. The current geopolitical landscape, characterized by declining post-war institutions and rising military budgets, makes triangular diplomacy a prominent approach for leaders. The effectiveness of this approach will depend on careful management of relationships to avoid unintended consequences. The optimism score is calculated with these aforementioned realities.</p>

          <p>The New York City Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice is running "Flip the Script," a program that trains at-risk teens and young adults in filmmaking to steer them away from gun violence. Participants, aged 18 to 24 and often with gun charges, are paid $20 an hour and mentored by entertainment industry professionals, learning both hard and soft skills. The program aims to provide a transformative outlet for processing trauma and establishing a pipeline to full-time jobs, with a high percentage of graduates remaining employed.

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) deployed a custom-wrapped food truck in front of the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to troll President Trump over his tariff policies. The stunt, intended to mock Trump's tariff policies with the acronym TACO ("Trump Always Chickens Out"), was widely criticized and ridiculed by conservatives on social media. Republican figures and commentators derided the effort as a cheap gimmick and an example of the Democratic Party's struggles with messaging during Trump's presidency. The DNC defended the stunt, stating it was meant to highlight Trump's tendency to back down on his tariff threats. The optimism score is based on the general political climate surrounding the event.</p>
