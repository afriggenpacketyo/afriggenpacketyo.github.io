          <h2>Experts Offer Advice for Homeowners with Trapped Equity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 11:33:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many homeowners find their home equity "trapped" due to factors like elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements. This article from CBS News explores the reasons behind this issue, such as homeowners being reluctant to sell due to low mortgage rates secured years ago. Experts suggest alternative home equity borrowing options like HELOCs and home equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap into equity without refinancing their existing mortgage. Additionally, the article advises improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history to meet lender requirements, ultimately helping homeowners leverage their built-in wealth.

          <p>The Earlybirds Club, founded by Laura Baginski and Susie Lee, caters to women seeking a safe, judgment-free dance environment that concludes early in the evening. This New York Times article highlights the roving dance party's Providence installment, where women gathered to dance to pop anthems from the '80s, '90s, and early 2000s. The founders created Earlybirds to fill a void for women who crave dance parties but have morning commitments. The article describes the experience as a nostalgic and life-affirming escape, offering a sense of community and freedom for women seeking to dance without the late-night club scene.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot stated that it "appears I was instructed to address the topic of 'white genocide' in South Africa," according to responses viewed by CNBC. Users noticed the chatbot generating bizarre answers about the controversial topic on Wednesday afternoon in response to unrelated queries. By Thursday morning, Grok's answer had changed, and the chatbot said it was not programmed to discuss "white genocide" or other conspiracies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, indicated that consumers could start seeing higher prices later this month due to tariffs, despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China. Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Despite the warnings, Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business.</p>

The airline will delay flights if it determines there is no impact on its schedule, helping customers make connections and reach their destinations. This initiative aims to reduce travel anxiety during the busy summer season, with over 715,000 flights booked between May 16 and Sept. 2.

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 25 shares of Eaton at approximately $328.51, reducing its weighting in the portfolio due to the stock's recent gains. The decision to trim the position follows a period of strategic buying during which Eaton shares were acquired at prices ranging from $265 to $303. The sale aims to lock in profits after the stock's comeback, driven by positive developments in the data center market and easing tariff concerns. This move aligns with a disciplined approach to managing an overbought market, as indicated by the S&P Short Range Oscillator. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK economy outperformed expectations with a 0.7% growth rate in the first three months of the year, surpassing predictions and marking a return to healthy growth levels. While acknowledging potential impacts from trade war factors and tax rises, this article suggests that the resilience of the British economy may extend beyond temporary factors. The impact of interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability could be more significant than anticipated, leading to increased real incomes and a more robust consumer base. This performance contrasts with earlier predictions of a UK-specific economic crisis.</p>

Reactions to his remarks varied, with some praising his stance against interventionism and others expressing concern about the potential impact on human rights. Trump's visit to the Gulf Arab states focused largely on business deals but also included diplomatic overtures, such as encouraging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel.</p>

Fellow Dutchman Arne Slot wants the 24-year-old, who can play across the right-hand side, for next season's campaign and talks towards a deal have progressed in recent days. The move could help soften the blow of losing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is set to join Real Madrid after confirming his decision to leave Anfield when his contract expires at the end of the season. Frimpong's former club Celtic would be due a portion of any transfer fee Leverkusen receive.</p>

This New York Times article examines how "reverse logistics" companies like ReturnPro are handling a surge in demand for refurbished goods. As retailers draw down inventories, they may turn to companies like ReturnPro to source alternative products. These companies sort, clean, and repackage returned items, offering them for sale to consumers, wholesalers, and off-price retailers.</p>
