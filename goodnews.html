          <p>A Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled that Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant framed for threatening President Trump, can be released on a $7,500 bond. Judge Carla Espinoza cited that she does not believe Morales-Reyes is a danger to the community pending removal proceedings, despite previous arrests. DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin stated that while Morales-Reyes is no longer under investigation for threats against the President, he is in the country illegally with previous arrests. Morales-Reyes's attorney expressed hope for his client's release and reunion with his family, pending any government appeal.</p>
