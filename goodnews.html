          <p>OpenAI has launched new parental controls for teen ChatGPT accounts, allowing parents to manage usage hours, disable voice mode, and prevent chat history from being saved or used for model training. These measures follow a lawsuit alleging ChatGPT encouraged a teen's suicide, prompting enhanced regulatory and public scrutiny. The system will also notify parents of potential self-harm signs, with an option to contact law enforcement in imminent threats if a parent cannot be reached. The article highlights OpenAI's commitment to providing age-appropriate experiences and its plans to build an "age prediction system" to automatically apply teen settings, though advocacy groups still call for stronger laws.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, a group of whitewater raft guides is leading extensive cleanup efforts along the Nolichucky River. The storm's remnants hurled debris, including railroad tracks and household items, into the river, forcing most rafting companies to close for the season. State-funded relief grants are now enabling out-of-work guides to remove trash, using their rafts to pile high amounts of garbage, even as the landscape has changed dramatically. The article highlights the community's resilience and determination to restore the river, with officials aiming for boat ramps and access points to reopen by the 2026 season, marking a rebirth for the now-dubbed "New-lichucky" and its outdoor tourism economy.</p>

          <p>Nepal, ranked 18th in the world, achieved a historic T20 cricket series victory over the West Indies, a full member nation, by bowling them out for just 83 runs in the United Arab Emirates.

The article highlights the significant upset for West Indies, which has faced recent struggles, including a crushing Test defeat by Australia and failure to qualify for the 2023 50-over World Cup. Nepal, coached by Australian Stuart Law, is now preparing for 2026 T20 World Cup qualifiers, celebrating a landmark achievement in their cricketing history.</p>

          <p>Starbucks has introduced a new line of protein lattes and cold foam drinks in the U.S. and Canada, hoping these year-round offerings will catalyze its turnaround efforts. Analysts predict the launch could significantly boost U.S. same-store sales by roughly 2.5 percentage points, tapping into the growing consumer trend for protein, with 70% of Americans trying to add more to their diets. This initiative is the first major innovation under CEO Brian Niccol's new "Starting 5" stage-gate testing process, designed to vet customer demand and operational feasibility. The article suggests that if successful, these drinks could lend credibility to Niccol's broader restructuring plans and restore investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory, despite ongoing near-term headwinds.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist, Dr. Rebecca Heiss, argues that conventional stress management advice often misses a crucial element: channeling stress energy outward to help others. Her research indicates that 58% of people feel more stressed when trying to control it internally, while programs encouraging charity work effectively improve well-being. The article explains that stress releases oxytocin, a hormone that motivates social connection, suggesting stress is designed to be a social experience rather than one to conquer alone. This "stress springboarding" approach, focusing on contributing to communities and supporting colleagues, can literally rewire the brain to handle stress more effectively, offering significant professional and personal benefits by turning stress into a competitive advantage.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are banking on Blake Snell to be their postseason ace, with the pitcher expected to start Game 1 of their wild-card series against the Cincinnati Reds. Snell, who signed with the Dodgers for $182 million, has had an injury-limited but effective season, posting a 2.35 ERA in 11 starts since returning from shoulder soreness. The article highlights Snell's past playoff struggles, including a controversial Game 6 exit in the 2020 World Series, and his personal mission to become a more efficient, deeper-inning pitcher. His recent top form, including a no-hitter last year and improved efficiency, suggests he is ready for this crucial role, aiming to prove himself as a bona fide October ace.</p>
