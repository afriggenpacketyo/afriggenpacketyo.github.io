        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that Elon Musk's tenure overseeing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has permanently altered how Americans view federal spending, despite criticisms. DOGE estimates it saved taxpayers $160 billion, though some sources claim the figure is closer to $63 billion, which is still a substantial amount. The piece highlights the speed and transparency with which DOGE identified and cut wasteful spending, citing examples such as funding for a former Taliban member and Sesame Street broadcasts in Iraq. Musk's approach has made bureaucrats more accountable and has opened up federal spending to public scrutiny, even though some Republicans may not be eager to codify the cuts.</p>

          <p>After a four-year, $70 million renovation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Michael C. Rockefeller Wing, which celebrates the arts and culture of Africa, the Pacific islands, and the Americas, has reopened. The wing, supported by the Rockefeller family, showcases a collection inspired by Nelson Rockefeller's passion for Indigenous art and catalyzed by his son Michael's collecting efforts in New Guinea before his disappearance. Michael's twin sister, Mary Rockefeller Morgan, played a crucial role in preserving and displaying the family's collection. The remodeled wing features 1,726 artifacts, representing about a quarter of the museum's trove of Indigenous art, emphasizing the importance and sophistication of these artistic traditions.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a star emitting an unusual combination of radio waves and X-rays, marking it as a rare member of the "long-period radio transients" class. Located 15,000 light-years from Earth, this star flashes every 44 minutes in both radio waves and X-ray emissions, setting it apart from other known examples. Researchers hypothesize that it may be a magnetar or a white dwarf with a companion star, but neither explanation fully accounts for its observed behavior. The discovery was made using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the ASKAP telescope in Australia, offering a unique opportunity to study the behavior of stars.</p>
