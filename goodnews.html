          <h2>Netflix Reports Strong Q2 Growth Driven by Hit Content, Price Hikes, and Ad Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 16:57:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has announced robust second-quarter financial results, with revenue climbing 16% to $11.1 billion and exceeding Wall Street expectations. This impressive growth is attributed to a combination of factors, including the global success of popular content like the third season of "Squid Game," recent subscription price increases, and a rapidly expanding advertising business. While the company no longer reports quarterly subscriber numbers, it raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling strong confidence in its current strategy. The ad-supported tier is a particular bright spot, now reaching over 94 million monthly active users and becoming a key driver of future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In celebration of its 70th anniversary, Disneyland has debuted a new attraction, "Walt Disney — A Magical Life," featuring a remarkably realistic audio-animatronic figure of Walt Disney himself. The show aims to illustrate the company's origins and connect modern audiences with the visionary man behind the global brand. The creation of the animatronic has been a complex and debated project, with Imagineers striving for lifelike accuracy in movement and appearance. While the figure has been praised as a technological marvel, it has also sparked controversy, with some, including Disney's own granddaughter, raising ethical concerns about immortalizing a person as a robot.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states are participating in a coordinated day of action to protest the policies of the Trump administration. The event, titled "Good Trouble Lives On," is being held on the fifth anniversary of the death of civil rights icon and Congressman John Lewis. With over 1,500 planned rallies, marches, and voter registration drives, the protests aim to carry forward Lewis's legacy of engaging in "good trouble, necessary trouble." Organizers are demanding an end to what they describe as crackdowns on civil and voting rights, the targeting of minority groups, and deep cuts to social programs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the GENIUS Act, its first major standalone legislation aimed at regulating the cryptocurrency market, specifically targeting stablecoins. This landmark bill, which received broad bipartisan support, is considered a significant victory for the crypto industry and President Trump, who has advocated for U.S. leadership in digital assets. The new law establishes a regulatory framework that requires stablecoin issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves and implement anti-money laundering protocols. However, critics argue the legislation is not sufficiently stringent and was heavily influenced by the crypto sector's intense and well-funded lobbying efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced mild swelling in his lower legs. In a press briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the circulatory condition as benign and common, particularly for individuals over the age of 70. The diagnosis was made following a comprehensive medical examination which ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. The White House also attributed recent bruising seen on the president's hand to frequent handshaking combined with his regular use of aspirin, asserting that Trump remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>Mark Johnson, a former HSBC currency trader who was convicted of fraud in the U.S. in 2017, has had his conviction completely overturned by an appeal court, ending a nine-year legal ordeal. Johnson was accused of "front-running" by manipulating the price of sterling before a massive $3.5 billion trade for a client. His defense consistently argued that his actions constituted a normal industry risk-management practice known as "pre-hedging." After serving time in both U.S. and UK prisons, his appeal was finally granted following a 2023 court decision that invalidated the law used in his original prosecution, leading to a full acquittal.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical reflection on the evolution of air travel, tracing its transformation from a glamorous and awe-inspiring miracle to the often stressful and unpleasant experience it is today. The piece argues that while many romanticize a past "golden age" of flying, early air travel was actually more expensive, dangerous, and less comfortable than its modern counterpart. It posits that industry deregulation, aggressive corporate cost-cutting, and heightened security measures have systematically degraded the quality of service, turning a remarkable feat of engineering into an endurance of "tiny indignities." The author concludes that this journey from miracle to mundane is the natural life cycle of any world-changing technology.</p>

          <p>Uber has announced a major partnership with electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro to deploy a fleet of over 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years. As part of the landmark agreement, Uber will make a $300 million investment in Lucid, which caused the EV maker's stock to surge 36% upon the news. Nuro will supply the Level 4 self-driving technology for the vehicles, which will be purpose-built for the Uber platform. The companies plan to launch their first driverless service in a major U.S. city next year, marking a significant acceleration in the commercialization of autonomous ride-hailing technology.

          <p>The British government has officially announced its intention to introduce legislation that will lower the national voting age from 18 to 16 for all UK-wide elections. This reform, a key campaign promise of the ruling Labour Party, is part of a broader package of what it calls "seismic changes" aimed at modernizing the country's democracy. The move would enfranchise an estimated 1.6 million teenagers. Proponents argue that 16-year-olds who can work, pay taxes, and join the army should have a voice in government, while critics continue to question their maturity and political knowledge necessary to vote responsibly.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the GENIUS Act, a historic piece of legislation designed to regulate cryptocurrency, after its passage was temporarily jeopardized by political infighting. A rebellion by a small group of right-wing Republicans initially stalled the bill, requiring direct intervention from President Trump to secure their support and move forward. The holdouts had attempted to package the bill with other controversial measures, leading to a nearly 10-hour procedural vote. Ultimately, a deal was struck, allowing the stablecoin regulation bill to pass with broad bipartisan support and advance to the president's desk for signature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg and other top executives at Meta have agreed to settle a massive, multibillion-dollar lawsuit brought by a group of shareholders regarding the company's handling of user privacy violations, most notably the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The shareholders were seeking $8 billion in damages to reimburse Meta for the extensive fines and legal costs incurred due to the privacy breaches. The final settlement amount has not been publicly disclosed. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants, including Zuckerberg, failed in their fiduciary duties, leading to significant financial and reputational harm, and the settlement allows them to avoid testifying under oath in court.</p>
