          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high, marking their best performance in five years, after the company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profits. The investment giant's success was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest such gain since June 2021. This positive result, fueled by returns from both private and public portfolio companies, signals a significant turnaround from the losses reported in the same period last year.

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a preliminary injunction to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of non-citizens and temporary residents. This marks the fourth court decision to halt the policy nationwide since a key Supreme Court ruling limited the scope of such injunctions. The judge certified the lawsuit as a class action, arguing the plaintiffs were highly likely to succeed in their claim that the order violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
