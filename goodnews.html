          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans. This article details the maximum borrowing amounts, which vary by dependency status, year in school, and degree level. For instance, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate limit for graduate students is $138,500. Since these limits often don't cover the full cost of attendance, the article suggests exploring private student loans to bridge the financial gap after exhausting federal options.

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting consumers seeking value amid economic pressures. CEO Russell Weiner stated that industry headwinds are creating opportunities for the company, which reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, exceeding estimates. The success is attributed to promotions like its $9.99 deal and new products, which have appealed to customers across all income levels. While facing challenges like competition from at-home dining, Domino's strategy parallels that of other brands successfully marketing value over fast-food rivals.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist and state senator Omar Fateh has secured the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party's endorsement for Minneapolis mayor, defeating incumbent Jacob Frey. Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the state senate, ran on a platform focused on affordability and public services. The endorsement process was contentious, with Frey's campaign alleging voting system flaws and planning an appeal. Despite losing the endorsement, Frey can still compete in the November general election, which uses a ranked-choice voting system.</p>

          <p>Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has revealed it holds approximately $2 billion in bitcoin and related digital assets, which now constitute about two-thirds of its liquid assets. The announcement, which caused the company's stock (DJT) to rise, marks a significant step in its pivot toward becoming a crypto and financial services firm. This move aligns with President Trump's broader embrace of cryptocurrency, which now accounts for a majority of his on-paper wealth. Critics raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest between his financial holdings and his administration's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary piece celebrates the surprising efficiency of the U.S. State Department's online passport renewal service. The author recounts receiving a new passport just 14 days after applying online, a stark contrast to previous bureaucratic experiences. The article credits the system's success to a dedicated team of public servants who modernized an outdated process that was struggling to keep up with millions of annual applications. This success challenges the common stereotype of government inefficacy and serves as a positive example of a public service that works exceptionally well for its citizens.</p>

The process of launching a missile is governed by strict, redundant protocols to prevent any single individual or crew from acting alone. It requires multiple officers in separate locations to simultaneously turn keys and levers after verifying encrypted orders. These extensive safeguards are designed to ensure that the ultimate weapon can only be used following a legitimate and confirmed command from the highest authority.</p>

Researchers like Dr. Melanie Cree are studying how GLP-1 drugs, which improve insulin sensitivity and aid weight loss, can also reduce PCOS symptoms like irregular periods and high testosterone levels.
