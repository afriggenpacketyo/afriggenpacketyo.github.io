          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to President Trump, the Philippines will eliminate all tariffs on U.S. goods, a detail Manila has not yet confirmed, while Indonesia will drop tariffs for 99% of its trade with the U.S. The deals also include provisions for military cooperation with the Philippines and the removal of Indonesian export restrictions on critical minerals. These agreements were reached ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to secure trade deals or face higher U.S. tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The general manager of the Washington Commanders and the D.C. mayor have expressed little concern over President Trump's recent comments about the football team's name. Trump had threatened to block the team's plans for a new stadium in the capital unless they reverted to their former name, the Redskins. Mayor Muriel Bowser indicated she remains focused on finalizing the stadium deal, suggesting a blockage is unlikely and noting the president is a fan of quarterback Jayden Daniels. Similarly, Commanders GM Adam Peters stated that the team is concentrating on its on-field performance and not on non-football-related matters like the stadium or name controversy.</p>

          <h2>India Defeats England by 13 Runs to Secure Women's ODI Series Victory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 15:49:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's women's cricket team clinched a 2-1 series victory over England after winning the final one-day international by 13 runs. Chasing a record 319 for victory, England's captain Nat Sciver-Brunt scored 98, but her dismissal proved to be a turning point. Despite contributions from the lower order, England was bowled out for 305. India's strong performance was anchored by captain Harmanpreet Kaur's century and a remarkable bowling display from 21-year-old Kranti Goud, who took six wickets. The result leaves England with significant challenges to address before the upcoming World Cup in India.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the current 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs between the United States and China will likely be extended beyond its August 12 expiration. Bessent expressed optimism about the state of trade relations, stating that upcoming talks in Stockholm will address the extension and other economic issues. The discussions aim to persuade Beijing to reduce its manufacturing surplus and curb its purchase of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This development follows a period of intense trade conflict where both nations had imposed tariffs exceeding 100% before agreeing to a temporary truce. (not investment advice)</p>

Key provisions include Indonesia dropping tariffs on internet data flows, removing pre-shipment inspections that hindered U.S. agricultural exports, and accepting U.S. motor vehicle safety standards. The deal also requires Indonesia to lift export restrictions on critical minerals, a significant concession for U.S. manufacturing and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson has been recalled to England's Test cricket team for the first time in eight years ahead of the fourth Test against India. The opportunity arises after an injury to Shoaib Bashir, who required surgery on his finger. Dawson, a 35-year-old all-rounder, offers a different style and more batting depth compared to the younger Bashir, strengthening England's lower order. His selection comes after a long period of being overlooked despite a strong domestic record. The recall places him in a key position to help England secure a series victory against India and potentially earn a spot in the upcoming Ashes tour.</p>

The suspension removes a significant overhang for the company, particularly alleviating concerns that the inquiry could disrupt the planned spinoff of its electronics division.
