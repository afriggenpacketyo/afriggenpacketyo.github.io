          <p>China has emerged as a dominant force in the global electric vehicle market, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023. Companies like BYD, which overtook Tesla as the top EV manufacturer, have expanded aggressively due to significant government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a strong battery supply chain. This rapid growth has prompted regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. and E.U., with new tariffs imposed to protect domestic industries from what they allege are anti-competitive practices. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, cementing its manufacturing dominance.</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese war approaches, China is positioning itself as a primary guarantor of the post-World War II international order. This stance challenges the Western narrative that often portrays China as a revisionist power seeking to disrupt the global system. Chinese officials emphasize the nation's immense sacrifice during the war, with an estimated 35 million casualties, as the foundation of its commitment to upholding global norms. The article explores how China's historical contributions as a key Allied power are central to its contemporary diplomatic messaging.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, projecting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive overall results, the company's stock fell in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. Nvidia's guidance suggests the global AI infrastructure buildout remains robust, with the company forecasting between $3 and $4 trillion in related spending by the end of the decade.

During a political summit, Padilla emphasized the importance of the November vote, which aims to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states. While he did not rule out a future gubernatorial campaign, he pivoted all inquiries back to the immediate need to focus on the ballot measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

A blackout was narrowly averted ahead of major sporting events, including the start of the college football and NFL seasons. The core of the dispute centers on the programming fees Fox is demanding from YouTube TV for the right to carry its content.</p>

          <p>Amid rising vehicle prices and interest rates, financial experts from Edmunds have highlighted five costly errors consumers should avoid when buying a car. These mistakes include purchasing a vehicle outside one's financial means, relying solely on dealership financing instead of securing pre-approval, and trading in a car with negative equity. The analysis notes a record number of buyers are committing to monthly payments of $1,000 or more, underscoring the importance of smart financial planning.

          <p>With a high probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, financial experts are advising savers on how to strategically manage their certificates of deposit (CDs). To maximize returns before rates fall, recommendations include shopping for the highest rates, which are often found at online banks, and locking in the longest-term CD that fits one's financial situation. Accurately determining the deposit amount is also crucial to avoid early withdrawal penalties that could negate any interest earned. Proactive measures now can help savers secure favorable rates before they decline. (not investment advice)</p>
