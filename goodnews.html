          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has elaborated on the company's $2.5 billion investment into its long-term partner Corning, which will manufacture all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at its Kentucky facility. Cook praised the quality, cost-effectiveness, and innovation of Corning's "ceramic shield" technology, highlighting its durability. The investment is expected to increase the factory's workforce by 50% and triple its production, positioning it as a world-leading site for specialized glass manufacturing. Both Cook and Corning CEO Wendell Weeks emphasized the positive economic impact of domestic manufacturing on local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have approved Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by overriding local zoning laws to permit denser housing near public transit. The bill, which now heads to Governor Gavin Newsom's desk, allows for the construction of buildings up to nine stories tall adjacent to major transit hubs. Proponents, like bill author Senator Scott Wiener, argue it is a necessary step to increase housing supply and affordability. However, the bill has faced criticism from local officials and residents who fear it will strip communities of their zoning authority and alter the character of single-family neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing generative AI to create real-time language translation devices, bringing a long-standing science fiction concept closer to reality. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, capable of instantly translating several languages. This move places Apple in direct competition with Google's Pixel phones, which feature "Voice Translate" that preserves a speaker's vocal inflections, and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. The rapid development of this technology signals a new competitive frontier in AI and could potentially reshape industries reliant on human interpreters.</p>

          <p>A loan estimate document for a home purchased by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook shows she declared the Atlanta property as a “vacation home,” potentially countering allegations of mortgage fraud leveled by the Trump administration. Critics have accused Cook of improperly claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences to secure favorable loan and tax terms. However, this document suggests she was transparent with her lender about the property's intended use. The revelation comes as Cook is fighting a dismissal order from the President, a move seen as part of a larger battle over the Federal Reserve's independence.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced a new five-week mentorship program called "OpenAI Grove," designed to support entrepreneurs in the earliest phases of building an AI-focused company. The program will provide a select cohort of about 15 participants with guidance from OpenAI's technical leaders, early access to new tools, and in-person workshops at its San Francisco headquarters. Unlike its Pioneer Program, Grove is aimed at individuals at the pre-idea or pre-seed stage. This initiative places OpenAI alongside other tech giants like Google and Microsoft in fostering the next generation of AI startups through dedicated accelerator programs.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff acknowledged competitor Palantir as an "inspiring" company but also took a swipe at its high costs, calling its software the "most expensive" he has ever seen. While Palantir's revenue is much smaller than Salesforce's, its rapid growth and high market valuation have clearly caught Benioff's attention. This public commentary highlights the growing rivalry between the two enterprise software giants, which sometimes compete for major government contracts. Palantir CEO Alex Karp has previously responded to similar remarks by stating his company is focused on value creation and is compensated accordingly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The state of Massachusetts has filed a lawsuit against the predictions market platform Kalshi, alleging that it is operating as an illegal sports gambling business without the required state license. Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell stated that Kalshi's "events contracts," which allow users to wager on the outcomes of sporting events, constitute sports betting under state law. Kalshi, which is regulated by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has maintained that its federal oversight supersedes state-level gaming regulations. The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kalshi from offering sports-related contracts in the state while the case is pending.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of conspiracies related to his efforts to overturn his 2022 reelection loss, including attempting to instigate a military coup. He was sentenced to over 27 years in prison and has been barred from seeking public office again. The author of this article draws parallels between Bolsonaro and Donald Trump, noting both tested democratic norms, claimed electoral fraud after losing, and saw their supporters riot. The conviction is presented as a significant act of democratic accountability, contrasting with the ongoing legal and political battles involving former presidents in other nations.</p>
