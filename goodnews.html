          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is leading a company-wide initiative to eliminate internal bureaucracy and reset the corporate culture to operate more like a startup. Speaking at a conference, Jassy explained that as companies grow, they can accumulate unnecessary processes that stifle the speed and innovation essential for staying competitive. To address this, Amazon has implemented measures like flattening its organizational structure and creating a "no bureaucracy email alias" for employees to flag inefficiencies. This effort is part of a broader strategy to slash costs and do more with less while investing heavily in new areas like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Democrat Xp Lee has won a special election in Minnesota, securing the House seat previously held by former Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated in June. Lee's victory over Republican Ruth Bittner restores a 67-67 tie in the state House, preserving a crucial power-sharing agreement between the two parties. The election took place amid heightened concerns over political violence, following both Hortman's killing and the recent assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lee's win prevents Republicans from gaining control of the House for the first time since 2018.</p>

          <p>A Metro train derailed at the 7th Street/Metro Center Station in downtown Los Angeles on Tuesday, causing major service disruptions during the evening commute. While the train remained upright and no injuries were reported, the incident halted service on the A and E light rail lines at a central hub. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not provide an estimated time for service restoration, stating the derailed train needed to be moved first. Commuters were advised to use alternative routes, including subway lines and shuttle buses, to navigate the significant delays.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has revealed plans to expedite the European Union's move away from Russian oil and gas imports. In a statement, she emphasized that Russia's war economy, funded by fossil fuel revenues, is financing the conflict in Ukraine. The announcement followed a call with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has linked further U.S. sanctions on Russia to Europe's actions. The EU's current timeline aims to halt Russian gas imports by 2028 and oil by 2027, but the new proposal seeks to achieve this goal sooner.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong presents a compelling case to co-host China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Shanghai's front-runner status. While Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure and political backing, Hong Kong's unique "one country, two systems" framework could provide a strategic advantage. The city's independent judiciary and legal system might help alleviate Western skepticism and encourage broader international participation in the initiative. This move could position Hong Kong at the center of China's AI diplomacy and influence the development of global AI standards amid ongoing U.S.-China tech tensions.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk, Dan Cooper, has spoken out after his attacker was sentenced to eight years in prison, 20 years after the sexual assault occurred. Cooper was 17 when he was attacked in 2004 by Shaun Gilder, but he was inspired to re-report the crime in 2018 after serving on a jury and witnessing the courage of others giving evidence. The long journey to justice highlights the lasting trauma of the attack, which led to a diagnosis of complex PTSD. By waiving his anonymity, Cooper now uses social media to share his experience and support other survivors.</p>

          <p>Some landlords in the United Kingdom are selling their rental properties in anticipation of the new Renters' Rights Bill, a major legislative overhaul of the private rental sector. The bill aims to provide tenants with greater security by banning "no-fault" evictions, allowing challenges to rent increases, and making it illegal to discriminate against tenants with children or on benefits. While renters' advocates welcome the changes, some landlords express concern that the new regulations will make their business untenable, potentially shrinking the private rental market and pushing rents higher. The government maintains the bill will level the playing field and is on track to become law this year.</p>

San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies later arrested 29-year-old Rashawn Lee at the shopping center in connection with the incident. No injuries were reported in the unusual confrontation.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the career of Robert Redford, who consistently chose complex, challenging roles over the easy path of a conventional Hollywood leading man. Despite his classic good looks, Redford gravitated toward characters that questioned American ideals, from selfish victors to tragic figures and frustrated idealists. His iconic roles in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men" used his all-American appeal to explore the nation's underbelly and hidden rot. As a director and founder of the Sundance Institute, he championed independent filmmaking, leaving a legacy that valued artistic integrity and substance over superficial celebrity.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's office has announced that five partially built homes in Laurel Canyon will finally be demolished under a plea agreement with the current developers. The structures, part of a project halted in 2002, have been the subject of a decades-long legal fight after the city ordered them torn down in 2003. Over the years, a series of owners failed to comply with the demolition order. The current owners, who faced 35 criminal charges for restarting construction, have pleaded guilty to failure to comply with city orders and must demolish the homes by August 2026 or face significant penalties.</p>

Currently valued around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has performed strongly, and Cramer notes that the entire banking sector is experiencing a positive trend with expanding price-to-earnings multiples.

          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a substantial increase from just over 6% a decade ago. According to the AA, the trend is largely driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, as electric and hybrid vehicles do not use manual gearboxes. Driving instructors note that automatics can make learning easier and safer, allowing drivers to concentrate more on the road, suggesting this trend will continue as the industry moves toward electrification.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds stirred up old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs when dry, loose ash is lifted back into the air, particularly during periods of drought. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not due to any new volcanic activity, and the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, the resuspended ash is considered hazardous and poses a potential risk to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant shift in strategy under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the free-scoring approach of the previous season. The team's recent 1-0 Champions League win against Villarreal marked their fourth clean sheet in five games, a stark contrast to their record at the same point last year. Players have spoken about a new "clean sheet mentality," focusing on a strong defensive structure that makes them difficult to beat. While this pragmatic style has been effective in preventing goals, it has also resulted in fewer offensive fireworks, with the team managing only one shot on target in their latest victory.</p>
