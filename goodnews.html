          <p>A new wellness trend called the "Great Lock-In" is gaining popularity on social media, encouraging people to use the autumn season to build healthy habits and reset routines before the holidays. Health experts suggest starting with small, realistic goals to build momentum, such as taking short walks or adding more produce to meals. They emphasize focusing on consistent progress rather than perfection and avoiding burnout by pacing oneself. The ultimate aim is to make these positive changes sustainable, turning them into long-term habits that extend beyond the season.</p>

          <p>As Halloween costume prices rise, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes made from thrifted items. With the average costume price increasing by 11% this year, many families struggle to afford the single-use expense. Waggoner spends thousands annually to collect, redesign, and store the costumes, which he then gives away for free at community events. He believes every child deserves to celebrate Halloween and hopes his efforts inspire others to help their communities, creating a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>Nathan Thomas, a sophomore at Jefferson County High School, has proposed the creation of a Youth City Council to the Wrens City Council in Georgia. His vision is to provide a platform for young people to gain a voice in their community and organize youth-focused events. The proposed council would mirror the structure of the actual city government, with positions like a youth mayor and council members. Thomas hopes this initiative will serve as a model for a similar county-level organization, fostering future leaders and encouraging civic engagement among the area's youth.</p>

          <p>Amidst recent market volatility, an Invesco senior portfolio manager suggests that income funds employing options-based strategies can offer investors structural protection. These strategies provide downside protection and income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle. This approach is gaining traction as investors seek reliable income sources independent of Federal Reserve policies. For those considering such investments, it is advised to seek ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be wary of unsustainable yields with high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the popular stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a recent study from the Kinsey Institute indicates that men are more likely to rush relationship milestones like moving in together or marriage. The primary motivating factor appears to be financial, as men are more inclined to speed up these steps to save money in the current economic climate. Experts also suggest that for heterosexual men, romantic relationships often serve as their main source of social and emotional support, making them more eager to secure a partnership to improve their psychological well-being.</p>

The International Atomic Energy Agency announced that both Russian and Ukrainian forces established special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. Restoring off-site power is critical for cooling the plant's six shutdown reactors and preventing a potential nuclear incident. The plant, Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since early in the 2022 invasion, and its power lines have been severed multiple times during the conflict.</p>

Another key mistake is not applying to enough scholarships; Greene suggests aiming for 100 to 200 applications to increase the odds of success.
