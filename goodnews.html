          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an Instagram photo of seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," a phrase used by critics of President Trump. The post sparked outrage from the Trump administration, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem alleging it was a call for the assassination of the president. Comey later deleted the post, claiming he didn't realize the numbers were associated with violence and that he opposes violence of any kind. This article highlights the ongoing tension between Comey and the Trump administration, and the Secret Service is taking the rhetoric seriously.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors sought safe havens amid trade tensions initiated by President Trump. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest monthly inflow since 1996. The article suggests that Trump's tariff policies altered global investors' outlook on the U.S. economy, leading them to diversify into markets like Japan. While confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, the surge highlights Japan's appeal as a safe haven during times of global economic uncertainty.</p>
