          <p>Tesla is planning to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip from the factory to a customer's house anticipated on June 28. The initial rollout will feature a limited number of Model Y vehicles in a geofenced area, monitored by remote drivers as a backup. Elon Musk stated that the robotaxis will operate only in the safest parts of Austin, with remote operations centers overseeing the vehicles. Analysts believe this venture could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, despite the company playing catch-up with competitors like Waymo.</p>

          <p>Tesla has signed its first agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, a project valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million). The plant, which Tesla claims will be the largest of its kind in China, will utilize Megapack batteries to balance electricity supply and demand. Tesla's Shanghai factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter of the year, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.

          <p>A $100,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide monthly payments ranging from approximately $627 to $652 for a single life annuity, or about $570 for a joint life annuity, but the exact amount depends on factors like gender, interest rates, and payout structure. Women typically receive lower payments due to longer life expectancies, and higher interest rates at the time of purchase result in larger monthly checks.

          <p>The Offer in Compromise (OIC) program allows eligible taxpayers to settle their tax debt with the IRS for a lower amount than what is owed. The IRS evaluates eligibility based on a taxpayer's ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, and applicants must have filed all required tax returns and made necessary estimated payments. The IRS calculates a reasonable collection potential, and the offer must equal or exceed this amount, with realistic and honest financial reporting being crucial for acceptance. Applying for an OIC requires substantial paperwork, including detailed financial statements and documentation, and the review process can take six to 24 months.</p>

          <p>To secure low student loan rates for the fall 2025 semester, it is important to maximize federal funding options by completing the FAFSA and then compare private lender rates, fees, and repayment terms. Optimizing your credit profile, using a cosigner if possible, and taking advantage of rate discounts and incentives can significantly lower borrowing costs. Choosing shorter repayment terms may also lead to lower rates, but it is important to balance this with affordability.
