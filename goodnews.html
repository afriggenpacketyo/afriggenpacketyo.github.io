          <p>Actor Ryan Reynolds shared an anecdote about a moment he infuriated Denzel Washington while filming the 2012 movie "Safe House." During an emotionally intense death scene for Washington's character, Reynolds' cell phone went off, playing his Frank Sinatra ringtone and ruining the take. Reynolds humorously recalled pretending the phone belonged to someone else to deflect the legendary actor's anger. The story was told during a discussion at the Toronto Film Festival, offering a lighthearted glimpse into the pressures of filmmaking.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, who is on President Trump's shortlist for the next Federal Reserve chair, stated that the central bank's monetary policy must be "fully independent of political influence." His comments come amid heightened concerns about White House pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates. Hassett asserted that allowing political leaders to control central banks is historically a "recipe for inflation and misery." The statement underscores a fundamental principle of economic stability even as the current administration challenges institutional norms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious decision by the McLaren Formula 1 team became a major talking point at the Italian Grand Prix. After a slow pit stop dropped Lando Norris behind his teammate and championship rival Oscar Piastri, the team ordered Piastri to let Norris back through to restore the pre-stop running order. The decision was justified by the team principal as consistent with their principles of fairness, as the position change was due to a team error. While the drivers publicly accepted the outcome, the incident highlights the intense pressure and complex dynamics of an intra-team title fight.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of government data shows significant variation in lottery spending across the United States, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 annually, a difference potentially attributed to accessibility in urban versus rural areas. On average, Americans spent about $320 on lottery tickets in 2023. The report also highlights that lottery sales constitute a notable source of state revenue, averaging about 1% of general funds and reaching as high as 3% in some states.</p>
