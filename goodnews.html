          <p>U.S. new vehicle sales have been stronger than anticipated, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units. Analysts attribute the surprising demand to consumer behavior, as many are purchasing vehicles now to avoid potential future price increases from tariffs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits. This pull-ahead effect has benefited major automakers like General Motors and Toyota, though the sales pace is expected to slow in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen, making it a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. A calculation shows that a $40,000 HELOC with a 15-year repayment term now costs approximately $379 per month, down from over $404 a year ago. With further rate cuts anticipated, HELOCs are positioned to become even cheaper, as their variable rates adjust automatically without the need for refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>
