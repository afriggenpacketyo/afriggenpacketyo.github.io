          <p>A new report from S&P analysts reveals that Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. These exports now total approximately $1.6 trillion, substantially more than the combined $1 trillion exported to the United States and Western Europe. The trend indicates a strategic pivot by Chinese firms to mitigate risks from U.S. tariffs and a slowing domestic economy. This shift is reshaping global commerce, potentially making South-South trade a new center of economic gravity with Chinese multinationals as dominant players. (not investment advice)</p>

Merz expressed that his expectations for the Washington summit, which included President Trump and other European leaders, were exceeded. The location for the proposed meeting has not yet been determined. Merz also emphasized that any peace agreement should not force Ukraine to cede territory, likening such a demand to the United States being asked to give up Florida.</p>

The U.S. also signaled it would help guarantee Ukraine's security, potentially through a $90 billion arms deal. The discussions highlighted a divergence on the need for a ceasefire, with European leaders pushing for one while Trump dismissed it as unnecessary for negotiations to begin.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has expressed concern that the artificial intelligence sector may be in an investment bubble, describing current valuations as 'insane.' While warning that some investors are likely to get 'very burnt,' he maintains that AI is a transformative technology and that OpenAI will continue to spend aggressively on infrastructure, potentially trillions of dollars. Despite the froth, market analysts differentiate the current boom from the dot-com era, noting that today's leading tech companies are funding growth with strong cash flows rather than debt, signaling a more structurally sound, albeit overheated, market.

This move is seen as a vote of confidence in Intel as it struggles to compete in the advanced AI semiconductor market and build its manufacturing business. The investment comes amid reports that the U.S. government is also considering taking an equity stake to bolster domestic chip production. The news caused Intel's shares to rise in after-hours trading, reflecting positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

According to data from the AI marketplace OpenRouter, its usage share has climbed to over 20%, second only to Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4. Alibaba claims the model's performance is on par with top competitors, attributing its success to improved training data and reinforcement learning techniques. The rise of Qwen 3 Coder comes as Chinese tech giants like ByteDance and Tencent are increasingly entering the competitive AI coding tool market.</p>

          <p>Coastal provinces in China are rolling out ambitious economic development plans focused on the marine sector, aligning with the national strategy to bolster the 'blue economy.' Regions like Fujian are concentrating on emerging areas such as digitalized marine governance, offshore energy, and tourism. Fujian has already launched a marine data platform aggregating billions of entries to aid in decision-making for ecological protection and emergency response. The province also aims to expand its offshore wind and solar power production, reflecting a broader strategic push to leverage geographic advantages for new economic growth.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign the sport, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues. Speaking during a broadcast, Manfred suggested that grouping teams by region into Eastern and Western conferences could reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television schedules. While such a move would likely face resistance from traditionalists, it could foster stronger regional rivalries. Manfred hopes to have the expansion process, with Nashville and Salt Lake City as potential locations, approved by 2029.</p>

          <p>An international research team is studying sediment cores drilled from the Antarctic seabed to understand centuries of climate and ocean history. By analyzing the layered mud, scientists can reconstruct past marine life, measure historical pollution levels, and calculate the amount of carbon buried on the seafloor. A key focus is using environmental DNA to assess the impact of industrial whaling, which removed vast numbers of whales from the Southern Ocean. This research aims to quantify how much carbon these large animals sequester, providing crucial data on the ocean's role in regulating the global climate.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a massive 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5km away. The relocation is necessary because over a century of iron ore mining has caused ground subsidence, threatening the old city center. The 672-tonne church has been lifted onto giant transporters for the two-day journey. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city's key buildings to safer ground, a process funded by the mining company. For residents, the event is an emotional moment, representing the preservation of their community's history.</p>

          <p>Meal-kit company HelloFresh has agreed to a $7.5 million settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit led by Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleged that the company misled customers with its automatic renewal subscriptions and made the cancellation process difficult, in violation of state laws. While denying any wrongdoing, HelloFresh will pay millions in civil penalties and restitution to affected California consumers who were charged for shipments without their knowledge and were unable to get a refund. The case was brought by California's 'Automatic Renewal Task Force,' which targets deceptive subscription practices.</p>

          <p>Newly-promoted Leeds United secured a victory in their first game back in the Premier League, defeating Everton with a late, controversial penalty. The match, played in a fervent atmosphere at Elland Road, was dominated by Leeds in the first half, though they failed to score. After a more balanced second half, a disputed handball decision against Everton's James Tarkowski led to the decisive goal. The win provides a crucial and optimistic start for Leeds in their campaign to remain in the top flight, while Everton's lackluster performance highlighted potential weaknesses early in the season.</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency regulation to ban the sale of bromazolam, a potent synthetic drug often called 'designer Xanax.' This action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to combat its distribution. The move was prompted by Kentucky's attorney general, who is also leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the federal DEA to enact a nationwide ban. The unregulated drug, linked to dozens of overdose deaths in Kentucky last year, poses a significant public health threat as it is often disguised as legitimate prescription medication.</p>
