          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff. His arrest concludes a multi-agency manhunt that began after the May 16 jailbreak, which officials attributed to significant design flaws and staffing issues at the facility. Groves, who was serving a life sentence for murder and manslaughter, was found in a crawl space after a SWAT team deployed gas canisters. This capture brings a long-awaited sense of justice to victims and the New Orleans community, though questions about the jail's security persist.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that a deal to end the war in Gaza is "very close" following a third day of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt. Mediators reported good progress on prisoner exchange lists and guarantees to prevent renewed fighting, with Hamas agreeing to release all Israeli hostages. The discussions centered on a 20-point U.S. peace plan, including a ceasefire and Israeli troop withdrawals. High-level negotiators, including Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, are involved, with Trump considering a visit to the region. Despite deep gaps remaining, optimism is spreading among participants for a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is undergoing its first brand refresh in 13 years, featuring a brighter aesthetic, a new font called "Domino's Sans," and a short jingle by singer-songwriter Shaboozey. The makeover, aimed at connecting with younger audiences, includes redesigned aprons, hats, promotional T-shirts, and revamped pizza boxes that prominently display the Domino's logo. Executive Vice President Kate Trumbull stated that this refresh, unlike typical rebrands during struggles, is about continuous improvement after years of growth. The company, founded in 1960, generates over 85% of its sales through digital ordering channels globally.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 17:29:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Newsom has signed the Real Food, Healthy Kids Act, a pioneering state law that defines ultra-processed foods and will ban certain "of concern" categories from California schools starting in 2035. The legislation mandates the state's Department of Public Health to identify these foods by 2028, initiating a major overhaul of school cafeteria meals. Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, the bill's author, emphasized the scientific consensus linking ultra-processed foods to health issues like obesity and asthma in children. The law aims to ensure students have access to healthier, more nutritious meals, with vendors prohibited from selling banned items to districts by 2032.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's National Guard Deployment to Oregon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 17:22:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deploying any National Guard units to Oregon, following a legal dispute over the federalization of troops. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut issued a temporary restraining order, ruling that conditions in Portland did not justify federal military intervention and that the president's claims about the city were "untethered to the facts." This decision came after the administration attempted to circumvent an earlier order by mobilizing National Guard troops from California and Texas. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later issued an administrative stay on Immergut's initial order concerning Oregon's own Guard, but the broader prohibition on all National Guard deployments to Oregon remains in effect.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel believes his team will enter the 2026 World Cup as "underdogs" and emphasizes the necessity of team unity for success. Despite reaching recent European Championship finals, England hasn't progressed beyond the World Cup semi-finals since 1966. Tuchel, who took charge in January, highlights that traditional football powerhouses like Brazil, Argentina, Spain, and France have more recent World Cup victories. He also suggests that anticipated extreme heat conditions in North America, where the tournament will be held, could particularly challenge European teams, making his underdog assessment more understandable.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast, dropping below the Category 1 threshold. The storm is bringing high surf conditions and gusty winds to Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. As of Wednesday afternoon, Priscilla had maximum sustained winds of 70 mph and was moving northwest at 8 mph, parallel to the coast. Forecasters anticipate further weakening over the next 48 hours, but warn that large swells generated by the storm will continue to cause life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding in affected areas.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has agreed to settle a $128 million lawsuit brought by four former top Twitter executives, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, over unpaid severance following his 2022 acquisition of the company. The executives claimed Musk fired them "without reason" and denied them severance, which included a year's salary and stock awards. While the settlement terms were not disclosed, this marks another legal resolution for Musk and X regarding unpaid severance, after a previous agreement with roughly 6,000 former rank-and-file employees. The lawsuit alleged Musk's actions were part of a pattern to avoid payments after being compelled to complete the $44 billion purchase.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader trade discussions, and Trump was reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, which would connect Alberta's oil sands to Nebraska, was previously blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations. While the company behind it had "moved on," the conversation signals renewed interest from the Trump administration. This discussion comes as Canada faces domestic pressure to secure trade and security deals amid U.S. tariffs.</p>

Blackburn's niece, Sandy Carmichael, expressed gratitude for the long-awaited resolution, emphasizing that "there's no such thing as a cold case" with advancements in DNA technology.
