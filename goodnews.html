Broadcom expects approximately $15.8 billion in third-quarter revenue, with $5.1 billion coming from AI chip sales, attributing the growth to investments from hyperscale partners. CEO Hock Tan highlighted the company's progress in developing AI chips with major cloud customers, anticipating continued AI growth through fiscal year 2026.

          <p>NATO defense ministers have shown broad support for a historic increase in defense spending, aiming for a total investment plan of 5% of gross domestic product in defense. This move responds to growing threats from Russia and a generally more dangerous global environment. NATO chief Mark Rutte proposed a division of the spending goal, allocating 3.5% of GDP to core defense spending and 1.5% to defense-related investment. The increased spending is expected to strain public finances, particularly in major European economies, but is seen as necessary for maintaining security.

          <p>Using a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off a mortgage offers flexibility, controlled costs, and competitive rates, with interest-only payments during the draw period. However, HELOCs come with variable interest rates, potential prepayment penalties, and the risk of foreclosure. Qualifying requires sufficient home equity, a strong credit score, and verifiable income. Alternatives include refinancing, home equity loans, mortgage recasts, and extra mortgage payments.
