          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a new agreement with Pakistan, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves." Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the US, a significant reversal from a potential 29% tariff. Details remain scarce, including specific tariff rates and the identity of the chosen oil company. This article notes the deal comes shortly after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on India and criticized its trade with Russia, suggesting a strategic realignment in the region, with Trump even suggesting Pakistan could someday sell oil to India.</p>
