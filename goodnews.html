While Trump touts it as a success of his tariff policy, the factory relies on global technologies, not solely American ones. TSMC, a Taiwanese company, is investing billions in the US to avoid tariffs, but the factory's success hinges on international supply chains. The factory is part of the US strategy to gain technological supremacy over China, yet it depends on a global combination of technologies.</p>
