        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers in Japan has requested the Defense Ministry to create an office dedicated to investigating Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. The proposal, submitted to the defense chief, emphasizes the urgency of addressing UAP as a serious national security concern, pointing out that Japan has lagged behind other nations in this area. The lawmakers suggested that the new office should regularly report to parliament, disclose information to the public, conduct scientific analysis, and identify potential threats, modeling it after the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. Optimism that the Japanese government will take the UAP topic seriously is a good sign.</p>

          <p>HiSilicon, Huawei Technologies‚Äô chip design unit, experienced a 100% revenue increase in 2024 due to Huawei's resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, according to Counterpoint Research. The unit's market share grew, capturing 12% of the global premium Android smartphone system-on-a-chip market, up from 8% in 2023, driven by the popularity of its Pura 70 and Mate 70 series smartphones. Other Chinese tech firms, like Xiaomi, are also seeking to design their own chips, with Xiaomi launching its smartphone chipset Xring O1 later this month. This indicates a growing trend of self-sufficiency in chip design among Chinese tech companies.</p>

          <p>The Sunday Times Rich List 2025 reveals a decline in the number of UK billionaires, marking the sharpest drop in the list's 37-year history, attributed to factors like global tariffs and tax changes. Simultaneously, King Charles' personal wealth has increased by ¬£30 million to ¬£640 million, equaling the wealth of Rishi Sunak and his wife, primarily due to his inherited investment portfolio from Queen Elizabeth II. The Hinduja family tops the list for the fourth consecutive year, despite a decline in their fortune, with a recorded worth of more than ¬£35 billion.</p>

          <p>President Trump's four-day trip to the Middle East resulted in a significant shift in policy toward Syria and the announcement of multibillion-dollar deals for U.S. companies. Key developments included a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria, reversing longstanding U.S. policies. The White House claimed the visit secured deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, although details were sparse.

Full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros, with Japan leading annual sales growth, buoyed by strong domestic and tourist spending and a weak Japanese Yen.</p>
