          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season against the Athletics, setting a new single-season record for catchers in Major League Baseball. This achievement surpassed Salvador Perez’s 2021 total and also marked Raleigh’s ninth multi-home run game, setting a new switch-hitter record for a season. The article details his impressive longballs, including a 448ft shot, and notes his journey as a first-time All-Star at age 28, fresh off a six-year, $105 million contract extension. His performance cements his rising prominence, making him a strong contender to lead the American League in home runs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Liverpool John Moores University reveals that insufficient hydration can significantly elevate stress hormone levels. Individuals drinking less than 1.5 liters of water daily exhibited a 50% higher cortisol response to stress compared to those meeting recommended intake. The article explains that exaggerated cortisol reactivity is linked to increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, and depression, as cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone. Experts, including Professor Neil Walsh, suggest keeping a water bottle nearby during stressful times and monitoring urine color as a simple hydration check, emphasizing potential long-term health benefits.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is moving north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, it was located about 295 miles east of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, moving at 13 mph.
