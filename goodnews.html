          <p>President Trump used his social media platform to pressure "everyone" to lower oil prices amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He warned that failure to do so would benefit "the enemy," although he did not specify who he was addressing. The price of U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both experienced slight decreases following Trump's post. Trump also urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling efforts. Optimism surrounding the oil market remains relatively stable despite the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent German study indicates that immigrants arriving in Germany and the European Union are more educated than ever before. In 2024, 32.1% of migrants from non-EU countries held a university degree or equivalent qualification, marking a record level and a continuing upward trend. However, a study by the Institute for Employment Research found that many economically successful foreigners are considering leaving Germany, often citing discrimination as a reason.

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers are voluntarily agreeing to speed up and reduce prior authorizations, a process often criticized by patients and providers. The changes aim to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce the administrative burden on providers. Insurers say the process ensures patients receive medically necessary care and allows them to control costs. The changes could cut into profits if they lead to patients using care more often, though the companies cheered the changes.</p>
