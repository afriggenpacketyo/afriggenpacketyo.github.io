          <p>President Trump is pursuing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, a policy called the "most favored nation" approach. Experts are skeptical about the feasibility of this plan, citing potential legal challenges from drugmakers and the need for congressional approval. The policy aims to address the issue of high U.S. prescription drug prices, which are significantly higher than in other developed nations. The article analyzes the potential impact on patients and the pharmaceutical industry, highlighting the uncertainties and challenges involved in implementing the policy. </p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition and subsequent reduction of triple-digit tariffs on Chinese products disrupted global trade but failed to achieve significant concessions from Beijing. This New York Times article examines the impact of Trump's aggressive trade policy, noting the standstill in trade, rerouting of business, and closure of Chinese factories. While trade talks resulted in reduced levies, the article questions whether the disruptions were worth the limited gains.
