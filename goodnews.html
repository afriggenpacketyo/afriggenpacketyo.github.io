          <p>Epic Games announced that Fortnite remains unavailable on iOS devices worldwide after Apple blocked their submission to reinstate the game on the App Store in the U.S. This action extends the ongoing dispute between the two companies, preventing Fortnite from being accessible on iOS. Epic Games had submitted Fortnite to Apple's U.S. App Store following a judge's ruling regarding commissions on purchases made outside of iOS apps. The article notes that Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, will replace its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, due to a sharp decline in its stock price that stemmed from increased competition for its popular weight-loss drug. The company's stock has fallen by 50 percent in the past year, reflecting challenges from lower-cost copycat versions and competition from Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound. Despite its initial lead, Novo Nordisk is losing market share to Eli Lilly, prompting the board to seek new leadership to navigate the evolving market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's Gulf tour secured what the White House claims is over $2 trillion in combined deals for the U.S. economy, but a Reuters analysis indicates the actual value is closer to $700 billion. Many of the corporate agreements were non-binding memorandums of understanding, and financial experts suggest the headline figures have been padded to showcase cooperation. While the trip included significant orders of Boeing planes and defense equipment, experts caution that the amounts are inflated and some deals would have occurred regardless of the administration.</p>
