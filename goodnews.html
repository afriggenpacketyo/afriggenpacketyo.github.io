          <p>South Korea is holding a snap election on June 3rd after President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law decree caused economic and political turmoil. The ruling conservative party faces losing votes due to the martial law debacle, which voters blame for weaker consumption and export momentum. Liberal Democratic Party frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls, promising stability after months of upheaval, and voters trust him to revive the economy more than conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo. Voters are closely watching economic pledges as consumption has been badly hit, and a win for Lee could spur faster economic growth in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author Salman Rushdie, who survived a near-fatal knife attack in 2022, has written about the experience in his new book, "Knife."

He emphasizes his determination to answer violence with art and to own his story rather than be defined by the attack. Rushdie also touches on the importance of free expression and the challenges of censorship in contemporary society.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia, despite its relatively small population, has produced a surprising number of successful actors in Hollywood. This phenomenon is attributed to factors such as the training provided by institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), a strong work ethic, and a lack of self-importance among Australian actors. NIDA emphasizes classical training, experimental theater, and accent work, preparing actors for international roles. The distance from Hollywood also allows Australian actors to develop their talents without the constant scrutiny of the industry.</p>

          <p>Robots are increasingly being used in sculpture, offering precision and speed but also sparking debate about artistry and tradition. Companies like Robotor use robots to carve marble with 99% accuracy, significantly reducing the time required for complex sculptures.

The use of robots raises questions about the role of the artist and the value of traditional skills.</p>
