          <p>The actors' union SAG-AFTRA has praised California Governor Gavin Newsom for signing new legislation that provides performers with stronger protections against the unauthorized use of their likeness by artificial intelligence. The law allows courts to order the removal of unlawfully replicated images or voices during legal proceedings, preventing ongoing harm to the individuals affected. This legislative action is seen as a significant victory for performers in an era of increasing concern over AI-generated deepfakes and digital misappropriation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Atlanta Falcons defeated the Buffalo Bills 24-14, largely due to a career-best performance from running back Bijan Robinson, who amassed 238 yards from scrimmage. Robinson's 81-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, the longest of the NFL season, was a pivotal moment in the game. The loss marked the second consecutive defeat for the Bills, whose quarterback Josh Allen threw two interceptions, raising questions about the strength of their 4-2 record.</p>

          <p>A woman named Tina, who lost much of her ability to speak after a traumatic brain injury from a fall, has found a new way to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). Her journey was featured in a BBC series where she and other retirement village residents were taught BSL, which uses gestures, facial expressions, and body language. Tina says that learning to sign has helped her relax and given her confidence, demonstrating that sign language can be a powerful tool beyond the deaf community.</p>

          <p>During Game 1 of the National League Championship Series, the Milwaukee Brewers turned a highly unusual double play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. A deep fly ball with the bases loaded bounced off the center fielder's glove and the wall, but a quick recovery and a baserunning error by the Dodgers allowed the Brewers to record two outs and escape the inning without giving up any runs. Despite the remarkable defensive effort, the Dodgers ultimately won the game 2-1.</p>

          <p>Despite recent escalations in their trade dispute, officials from China and the United States held working-level talks, according to China’s Ministry of Commerce. The ministry's statement confirmed that communication channels remain open but also urged the U.S. to "show sincerity for dialogue" rather than engaging in intimidation and threatening new restrictions. The talks occurred after the U.S. expressed frustration over Beijing's expansion of rare earth export controls and alleged refusal to discuss the matter.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, exceeding economists' expectations, though this marked a slowdown from the previous quarter. The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softening construction activity. Despite the positive current data, the country's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, warned that GDP growth is likely to moderate in 2026 as global trade conditions evolve.

          <p>An analysis of social media trends and public opinion data suggests a significant shift in how young people in Vietnam view their powerful neighbor, China. Attitudes appear to be softening, influenced by positive portrayals on platforms like TikTok and growing economic ties, which contrasts with historical tensions and territorial disputes. This evolving sentiment is allowing Vietnamese leaders to pursue more cooperative projects with China that were previously too controversial due to nationalist opposition.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte humorously commented on the state of Russia's naval fleet, joking that a Russian submarine seen in the English Channel was on a "hunt for the nearest mechanic." His remarks came after the diesel-powered submarine Novorossiysk was observed on the surface, with Dutch authorities reporting it was under tow. Russia's Black Sea Fleet denied any malfunction, stating the submarine surfaced to comply with navigation rules for the channel.</p>

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new hands-free law to combat distracted driving, prompted in part by the tragic death of a triathlon volunteer killed by a driver who was video chatting. To enhance enforcement, the state's Department of Transportation is using anonymous telematics data from smartphones and vehicles to identify "hot spots" where distracted driving is most prevalent. This data-driven approach allows for more targeted educational campaigns and increased law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill creating a state commission to study inequalities in youth sports related to factors like race, income, and gender identity. The legislation has drawn criticism from Republicans, who argue it is an indirect way to promote the participation of transgender girls in female sports. This move comes after Newsom himself publicly stated that the inclusion of transgender women in women's sports was "deeply unfair," highlighting the complex and politically charged nature of the issue.</p>
