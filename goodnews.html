          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting and then deleting a social media post that Republicans alleged was an incitement to violence against President Donald Trump. The post featured seashells arranged to spell the numbers "8647," which some interpreted as a threat, as "86" is slang for "get rid of" and Trump is the 47th president. Comey deleted the post, stating he did not realize the numbers were associated with violence and that he opposes violence of any kind. The Secret Service confirmed they are taking the rhetoric seriously and investigating the matter.</p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics committee is partnering with Archer Aviation to provide an air taxi service during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. Spectators could potentially fly through Los Angeles skies, avoiding traffic, with flights between select venues. The piloted Midnight aircraft, an electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), can carry up to four people. Archer Aviation hopes to be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in time for the Games, aiming to offer short-haul air travel comparable in price to a high-end Uber.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is facing challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. Fisherman Brand Little is using a high-tech system with remote-controlled pop-up balloons to avoid whale entanglements, enabling him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to mitigate the risk to migrating whales. The pop-up technology, originally developed by the U.S. military, helps fishermen retrieve their catch without the long lines of rope that can harm whales.</p>

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal has suggested that the recent Blue Origin space flight, which featured an all-female crew, may not have actually occurred. O'Neal's theory centers on his belief that Jeff Bezos would not risk sending his fianc√©e, Lauren Sanchez, into space. He also pointed out discrepancies within a video released by Blue Origin, including the unchanging hairstyles of the crew members. Several celebrities attended the event, and Katy Perry described the experience as "second to being a mom."</p>

          <p>Ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge connecting the continents. The study of fossils, including Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, revealed mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses undertook multiple migrations between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges occurring in both directions. The findings provide insights into the evolutionary history and dispersal patterns of ancient horse populations.</p>
