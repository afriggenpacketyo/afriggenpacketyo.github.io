          <p>A federal judge ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University doctoral student from Turkey, who had been detained by immigration authorities. The judge, William K. Sessions III, expressed concerns that her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens, emphasizing the importance of First Amendment rights. Ozturk's lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel that she co-wrote. The judge ordered her release without any form of monitoring. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be immediately released from immigration custody on bail as she pursues a challenge to her detention after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. The judge said Ozturk raised "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was taken into custody. Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville residence. The Department of Homeland Security said Ozturk "had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'"
