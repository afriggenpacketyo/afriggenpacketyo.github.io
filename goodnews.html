        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Sunday Times Rich List 2025 reveals a decrease in the number of UK billionaires, attributed to criticism of tax changes implemented by the new Labour government, while King Charles' personal wealth has increased significantly. The number of billionaires in the UK has fallen from 165 to 156, marking the sharpest decline in the list's history, with concerns raised about the impact of tax changes on both homegrown and overseas entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, King Charles' wealth grew by ¬£30 million to ¬£640 million, elevating his rank to 258 alongside Rishi Sunak and his wife. The Hinduja family remains at the top of the list with a fortune exceeding ¬£35 billion. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan witnessed record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking refuge from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows since 1996. The shift was largely driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, who aggressively bought equities, while bond purchases were fueled by reserve managers, life insurers, and pension funds. As the U.S. softens its trade stance, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, potentially impacting the future appeal of Japanese assets.</p>

          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice suggests that the UK should draw inspiration from Dubai's national pride and low crime rates. Tice, who frequently visits Dubai, praised the city's safety, where belongings are purportedly left unattended without risk of theft, and the practice of instilling national pride in schools. While acknowledging Dubai's imperfections, Tice argues that politicians are neglecting valuable lessons from countries that are "getting it right." His comments follow Isabel Oakeshott's praise of Dubai as a "multi-cultural success story" with a "booming economy" and "culture of respect."</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law allowing preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches to the government. The government aims to be fully operational with these measures by 2027, reflecting its ambition to enhance cybersecurity capabilities to levels comparable to the United States and major European nations. An independent panel will be established to provide prior approval for data acquisition, analysis, and actions to neutralize hostile servers, while specific provisions in the law aim to uphold personal rights.</p>

          <p>Nissan is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. The struggling company, which employs thousands of people in the UK, said it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally." Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. This week, Nissan also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.6bn; ¬£3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs putting further pressure on the struggling firm.</p>
