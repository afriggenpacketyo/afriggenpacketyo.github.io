          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London, revealing insights into a luxurious Roman villa. The fragments, found in 2021, have been pieced together to reveal detailed paintings of musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, indicating the affluence of the area during Roman times. One fragment includes the Latin word 'Fecit,' suggesting the presence of skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire. The discovery sheds light on the early development and sophistication of Roman London, depicting it as a thriving settlement with wealthy suburbs.</p>
