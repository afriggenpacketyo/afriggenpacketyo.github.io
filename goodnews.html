          <p>Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras to advance to the Club World Cup semi-finals, but the match was highlighted by a stunning goal from Palmeiras's 18-year-old phenom, Estevao Willian. The highly-touted Brazilian, who has already signed with Chelsea in a deal worth up to £52m, scored a brilliant equalizer in what was his final game for the Brazilian club. Despite the loss, Estevao's performance generated significant excitement among Chelsea fans and management for his future at the London club. A late own goal ultimately decided the match in Chelsea's favor.</p>

          <p>The Hamas organization has publicly stated it issued a "positive response" to the latest ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, Egypt, and Qatar. This development follows President Trump's announcement that Israel had agreed to a two-month ceasefire framework, a statement he remains optimistic about. Palestinian officials indicated that Hamas is seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war following the truce. The ongoing conflict, which began after the October 7th attack, has resulted in a significant number of casualties in Gaza.</p>

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Oasis officially reunited for their first concert in 16 years, performing to a sold-out stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The show marked the beginning of their global "Live '25" tour, ending a long and famously acrimonious feud between brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher. Fans from around the world attended the highly anticipated event, which featured a setlist packed with the band's classic 1990s hits. While the brothers maintained some distance on stage, their performance was powerful and well-received by the ecstatic crowd.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, during his first official visit. The award symbolizes the deep historical and friendly ties between the two countries, which date back to the 19th-century arrival of indentured Indian laborers. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships in sectors like energy and health, and Modi announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards, allowing them to live and work in India.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly sticking to their existing trade deadline plans despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy. While the initial injury appeared severe, tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage, and Muncy is expected to return in about six weeks. With a comfortable timeline for his recovery before the playoffs, the team's management feels no urgent pressure to acquire a high-profile replacement. The Dodgers plan to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to fill the position in the interim, confident they can weather Muncy's temporary absence.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaway peninsula in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to shore. Officials used drone technology to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure the safety of beachgoers enjoying the holiday. The sightings were confirmed near several locations, leading to a brief shutdown of at least one beach area before it was reopened. The incident comes as New York state authorities have increased shark surveillance measures along Long Island beaches for the summer season.</p>

          <p>This article examines the evolving perceptions of crying in the workplace, prompted by a recent emotional appearance by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves. While traditionally seen as unprofessional, many experts now argue that showing emotion can be a sign of strength and emotional intelligence. The piece includes anecdotes from both men and women who have cried at work and explores whether it can impact career progression. The consensus suggests that while some biases still exist, modern workplaces are increasingly valuing authenticity and compassionate leadership, reframing emotional expression as human rather than a liability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny marine creatures called zooplankton in mitigating climate change through a process of seasonal migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists have calculated that this "seasonal vertical migration pump" sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of about 55 million cars. This discovery underscores the profound and previously underestimated importance of these obscure animals in regulating the planet's climate.</p>
