Ryan rents a two-bedroom apartment in one of the city's tallest residential towers for just $850 per month.

          <p>After more than 20 years of extensive renovation, the tomb of Amenhotep III, one of ancient Egypt's most prominent pharaohs, has reopened to the public. Located in the Valley of the Kings near Luxor, the tomb had been under a Japanese-led restoration project to preserve its intricate wall paintings and structure. Amenhotep III, who ruled during the 18th Dynasty, was known as Amenhotep the Great. The reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism industry, a crucial source of foreign currency, ahead of the official inauguration of the Grand Egyptian Museum near the Giza Pyramids.</p>

Risher recalled that Bill Gates called it the "stupidest decision" he had ever heard. However, Risher was won over by Bezos's intense focus on the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Amazon surpassed that goal a year early, hitting $1.6 billion in revenue in 1999, with Risher playing a key role in its expansion into new product categories like music and movies.</p>

          <p>Kelsey Mora, a child life specialist and therapist, recommends a unique practice for parents: creating an email address for each child at birth and sending them messages over the years. This digital time capsule serves as a living legacy of love, advice, and cherished memories that the children can access when they are older. She writes to her children on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to process her own feelings. Mora sees it as a way to preserve connection and ensure her children will always have a collection of reminders that they were seen and loved.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new album, "The Life of A Showgirl," has ignited fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song describes another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie," which fans connect to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife," allegedly written about Swift. In an accompanying film, Swift explained the new song is a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation.</p>

          <p>Urenco USA, the only commercial uranium enrichment facility in the United States, is expanding its New Mexico plant to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This increased demand is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing. The expansion is also critical as the U.S. prepares to ban Russian uranium imports by 2028, which currently account for 20% of its supply. While the industry faces a pivotal moment, challenges remain, including bottlenecks in the nuclear fuel supply chain and the need for significant upgrades to the aging U.S. electric grid.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after persistently requesting early screening. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI revealed two suspicious masses, leading to a diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma. Because the cancer was caught early, her prognosis is excellent, and she underwent a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy. Her oncologist credits Del Barrio's self-advocacy for the favorable outcome, highlighting the importance of understanding personal risk factors and pushing for appropriate medical care, as breast cancer rates are rising in younger women.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, attributed her health and activism in part to a plant-based diet she adopted over 50 years ago. She made the change after looking at a pork chop and connecting it with the fear, pain, and death of an animal. Goodall's decision was driven by ethical opposition to factory farming and concern for the environmental damage caused by meat production. She often spoke about feeling better and lighter after eliminating meat and encouraged others to consider a plant-based lifestyle for the well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.</p>

An iconic moment, when the chimp she named David Greybeard gently took her hand, symbolized her life's mission of fostering connection and understanding.

Koerner accelerated the process by liquidating retirement funds to start construction immediately, rather than waiting for insurance payouts.

This trend is driven by Gen X and Millennial parents who fear their children won't be able to achieve the same lifestyle, leading them to compromise on prestige for better financial value. As a result, universities once considered regional are rising in prominence, while the dominance of traditional elite institutions is being challenged.</p>
