          <h2>Early Vote Counts Suggest Government Reelection in Australia</h2>

          <p>Early vote counting in Australia's general election suggests the ruling center-left Labor Party is likely to be reelected for a second term, amid major campaign issues such as energy policy and inflation. The Australian Electoral Commission's early projections gave the Labor Party 70 seats and the conservative opposition coalition 24 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese noted his government improved relations with China, removing trade barriers costing Australian exporters $13 billion annually. The election occurs during a cost-of-living crisis, with both sides promising policies to aid first-home buyers, and may result in a minority government if Labor loses more than two seats.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, marking a potential comeback for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released in southern Mexico City in 2017 and 2018, finding they survived and gained weight, indicating successful hunting and predator avoidance. This success in both artificial and restored wetlands suggests potential for scaling back habitat degradation and climate change effects. Axolotls, named after an Aztec god, are culturally significant to Mexicans and medically valuable due to their regenerative abilities, making their conservation a priority.</p>
