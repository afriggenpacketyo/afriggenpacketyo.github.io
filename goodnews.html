          <p>Shohei Ohtani's significant batting struggles in the Dodgers' National League Division Series, where he managed only one hit in 18 at-bats with nine strikeouts, are raising alarms ahead of the NL Championship Series. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the challenge of facing numerous left-handed pitchers but stressed that Ohtani's "at-bat quality needs to get better." Roberts explicitly stated the Dodgers cannot achieve a World Series victory with such a performance, urging the superstar to critically re-evaluate and adjust his approach. The article underscores the immense pressure on Ohtani to improve his game, as his contribution is vital for the team's championship aspirations this season.</p>

          <p>Doncaster heavyweight boxer David Allen experienced a unanimous points defeat against Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a highly anticipated fight at Sheffield Arena. Despite the overwhelming support from a 9,000-strong home crowd, the 33-year-old, who had previously retired from the sport, was outscored by Makhmudov. The judges' scores were 115-111, 117-109, and 116-110 in favor of the Russian. Allen, known as the 'White Rhino,' expressed profound gratitude for the atmosphere and insisted he is "not finished," signaling his determination to continue his boxing career despite this latest challenge.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK are scheduled to go back by one hour on Sunday, October 26, 2025, signaling the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, occurring at 02:00 BST, grants most people an extra hour but extends night shifts. The change brings earlier sunsets, making nights draw in noticeably faster. Originating during World War One to conserve fuel, the practice continues to be debated, with arguments for permanent summer time citing economic benefits and reduced accidents, while opponents highlight the extremely dark winter mornings, especially in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's debut in a preseason game for the Lakers remains uncertain, with coach JJ Redick stating it's "to be determined" for Sunday's matchup, despite Doncic's full practice participation. The star guard expects to play in two preseason games, but the team faces a significant challenge with LeBron James sidelined for three to four weeks due to a sciatica nerve issue. Doncic acknowledges James's absence as a "big change" but stresses the team's "next man up" mentality. The article underscores the Lakers' need to adjust their strategy and lineup without James, relying on Doncic and others to carry the load.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen recounts her initial shock and subsequent journey to understanding her 86-year-old mother Patsy's decision to donate her body to medical science. Patsy, motivated by gratitude for her own medical treatment and a desire to contribute to future doctors' education, has made all necessary arrangements with a university. This choice, however, presents emotional challenges for the family, who must wait for a funeral while the body is used for up to three years. Owen's investigation into Cardiff University's anatomy center sheds light on the educational value of such donations and the declining rates, emphasizing the profound impact on both medical students and grieving families.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, with many individuals reporting severe symptoms from common colds, flu, and Covid-19. Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" created by increased indoor gatherings, children returning to school, and adults resuming work as the weather cools. Rhinovirus, or the common cold, is the most prevalent, alongside new Covid variants and an earlier-than-expected rise in flu cases among younger age groups. Despite the high number of people feeling unwell, the UK Health Security Agency states that overall illness levels are not exceptionally high, emphasizing vaccination for vulnerable populations and basic hygiene.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is officially ending support for its Windows 10 operating system on October 14, which will leave millions of devices vulnerable to security risks without crucial updates. Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to Windows 11 for free, although many older computers lack the necessary compatibility. Consumer groups have criticized this decision, arguing it will result in significant unnecessary expenditure and increased electronic waste. An Extended Security Updates (ESU) program is available, providing updates until October 2026, but typically requires a Microsoft account and may involve a fee.

          <p>China is currently formulating its 15th five-year plan, a pivotal blueprint anticipated to significantly reshape its approach to infrastructure development. This new plan builds upon decades of rapid expansion, including a substantial 2009 stimulus package that leveraged public works to mitigate the global financial crisis. While previous projects successfully connected vast populations, some also contributed to local government debt. Despite these challenges, officials and economists foresee continued, though more technologically advanced and people-centric, infrastructure investments. There is optimism regarding the scale of spending over the next five years, indicating a strategic evolution in China's national development priorities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that strong US-Gulf partnerships have the potential to undermine China's aspirations for AI leadership, despite Beijing's notable progress, such as its commercial underwater data center in Hainan. The article highlights the significant expansion of data centers in the United Arab Emirates, fueled by multi-billion-dollar agreements with the Trump administration for chip supplies. This strategic collaboration, particularly the Stargate UAE AI data center leveraging US technology, grants the United States a competitive advantage in terms of capital and supply chain alignment with key chip producers like Nvidia. China's limitations in corporate investment present a considerable challenge to its near-term leadership in the data center industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration is prohibited from deploying the National Guard in Illinois, partially affirming a lower court's decision. The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit clarified that while the Guard could remain under federal control, its active deployment within the state was blocked. This ruling supports the stance of Illinois and Chicago officials, who had sued the administration, arguing that the deployment constituted a "grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty." President Trump had justified the deployment citing concerns over crime and illegal immigration, but the judiciary found insufficient evidence of "rebellion" to warrant such federal intervention.</p>
