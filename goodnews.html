The app integrates a wallet, trading, payments, and social features, all running on the company's Base blockchain. This move aims to attract mainstream consumers not primarily interested in speculative trading, diversifying Coinbase's revenue streams. Key features include Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify, and an identity verification system, representing a significant push to drive real-world utility for cryptocurrency.

          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska was canceled after being briefly issued following a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on Wednesday. The quake, which struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially prompted a more severe tsunami warning, leading to evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Authorities later downgraded the alert, advising people to stay away from the water but confirming that large, widespread waves were not expected as the event occurred in shallow water. The region, located on the seismically active "Ring of Fire," experienced multiple aftershocks but no major damage was reported.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. While Trump praised the move as "just better," the company has not officially confirmed the change, only stating that it appreciates his enthusiasm and will share details on new offerings soon. This potential switch would align U.S. products with those in other countries like Mexico and the UK, but has drawn criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned of job losses and increased foreign sugar imports.</p>

          <p>Thousands of flat owners in the UK are planning a class-action lawsuit against the companies that own their apartment blocks, known as freeholders, over alleged secret commissions. The lawsuit claims that freeholders received undisclosed fees from insurance companies for arranging building insurance, then passed these costs on to leaseholders through inflated service charges. Lawyers suggest each flat owner could be due up to £2,000 in compensation. The legal action targets several large freeholding companies, who deny any wrongdoing, and highlights a practice that may have become more profitable following the post-Grenfell spike in insurance costs.</p>

          <p>Traditional media companies are increasingly partnering with established podcasters to attract younger, online audiences who are moving away from cable television. In a recent example, Fox News Media signed a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless," aiming to expand its digital footprint and reach the show's key demographic of men aged 18 to 45. This strategy, also employed by companies like ESPN with Pat McAfee, allows legacy brands to tap into new revenue streams and gain relevance in the digital sphere. The trend reflects a broader industry shift as media giants seek to either compete with or acquire successful online content creators.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is set to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants to the United Kingdom. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to the UK, closing a loophole that existed because the UK is outside the European Union. This commitment is part of a broader UK-German agreement on migration and defense, aimed at disrupting the supply chains for small boats used in dangerous Channel crossings. The move is welcomed by the UK government, which is under pressure to address the rising number of people making the journey.</p>

          <p>United Airlines beat second-quarter earnings estimates and reinstated its full-year profit forecast, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that the "world is less uncertain" now than at the start of the year. After a weak start to 2025, the airline expressed confidence in a strong finish, projecting adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share. The company's second-quarter revenue rose 1.7% to $15.24 billion, though unit revenue declined, particularly on domestic routes. The optimistic outlook signals a potential stabilization in travel demand, especially after operational constraints at its Newark hub had previously impacted performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark UK study has confirmed the birth of eight healthy babies using a technique known as mitochondrial donation, which combines DNA from three people to prevent devastating inherited diseases. The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' embryo into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria, the cells' energy sources. This prevents the transmission of incurable mitochondrial diseases, which can cause severe disability and are often fatal. The results, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, are being hailed as a major breakthrough, offering hope to families affected by these genetic conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that China is making "big steps" in its efforts to control the flow of fentanyl into the United States. This positive assessment marks a significant shift in tone from his previous statements, where he directly linked the fentanyl crisis to the justification for imposing steep tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump's comments come amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries. He acknowledged that while tariffs were a penalty related to fentanyl, Beijing now seems motivated to address the issue, suggesting a potential area of cooperation amid broader trade disputes.</p>
