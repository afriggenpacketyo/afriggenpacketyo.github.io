          <h2>Former Prison Guard Reflects on Executions in Japan</h2>

          <p>A former prison guard in Japan recounts his experiences as a "noose handler," detailing the procedures involved in executions and the emotional toll it took on him. The guard, now in his 70s, says he supported the death penalty as a job but is haunted by the faces of the condemned. He explains that inmates are typically notified only one to two hours before their execution and are provided snacks and drinks, and can leave a verbal will. The Justice Ministry opened the Tokyo Detention House's execution chamber to media organizations in 2010, when the Democratic Party of Japan was in power, but has not responded to requests for further inspections since. The former prison officer pointed out that he does not know how the order of executions is determined, calling it a "black box."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by concerns over ultra-processed foods, retailers and brands are increasingly offering products with fewer ingredients. This trend caters to consumers with allergies and those seeking simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. However, some nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients in the pursuit of minimal processing. While processing ensures food safety and extends shelf life, simplifying formulas and utilizing novel processing technologies can help create less processed products without compromising nutritional value.</p>

Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city's focus is on providing shelter, mental health services, and drug treatment, not criminalizing poverty. While arrests are a last resort, the city's efforts have led to a visible increase in the number of sheltered homeless individuals.</p>

He highlighted Broadcom, Seagate, and Johnson Controls as beneficiaries of the data center trend. Cramer identified subscription model businesses like Netflix and Spotify and uniform-maker Cintas as successful. He suggests buying any of these stocks if they fall 5% to 8% from their current levels. (not investment advice)</p>
