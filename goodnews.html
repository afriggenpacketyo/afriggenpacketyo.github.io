        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has introduced Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to create local communication clusters, allowing for encrypted, ephemeral messages to be passed between nearby devices. This design ensures functionality even during internet outages or censorship, echoing Dorsey's focus on privacy and resilient communication. The beta version is currently available, with future plans to integrate WiFi Direct to enhance its range and speed, furthering the vision for off-grid, user-owned communication tools.</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory in the third stage of the Tour de France, edging out Italy's Jonathan Milan in a dramatic photo finish. The stage was marked by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Despite the chaotic finish, Mathieu van der Poel successfully retained the overall leader's yellow jersey. General classification contenders Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard managed to avoid the late crashes and finished safely within the main group, maintaining their second and third place positions in the overall standings.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed microscopic robots capable of treating sinus infections by directly targeting and eliminating bacteria within the nasal cavity. These dust-sized robots, made of magnetic particles, are guided to the infection site where light activation triggers a chemical reaction that breaks through mucus and destroys pathogens. This targeted, drug-free approach could reduce side effects and combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. While animal trials have been successful, further research is needed to ensure safety and public acceptance before the technology can be widely adopted for human use.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. This performance overtakes the $221 million gross of "Napoleon," setting a new record for the tech company's burgeoning film division. The movie's success has been significantly boosted by a partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total earnings. Despite its high ticket sales, the film, which had a budget between $200 and $300 million, still faces a long road to profitability for Apple.</p>

          <p>Reading council in the UK is considering a new Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) to combat anti-social behavior throughout the borough, including issues like aggressive begging, street drinking, and the misuse of e-scooters. The proposed order would grant council staff and police greater authority to intervene and enforce rules, addressing what they describe as prevalent problems. Officials stated that a previous PSPO was not effective due to a lack of enforcement, a lesson they plan to apply this time. If approved by councillors, a public consultation on the new measures could begin in July.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated 18 lions that were being kept illegally as pets in the densely populated region. The crackdown followed an incident where a lion escaped from a home in Lahore and attacked three people. Keeping exotic animals is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite strict regulations. Officials have also raided dozens of breeding farms and arrested eight people for rule violations. The offense of illegally keeping big cats is punishable by up to seven years in prison.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line calling system to prevent a repeat of a controversial incident caused by human error. The change removes the ability for Hawk-Eye operators to manually deactivate the ball-tracking technology. This follows a fourth-round match where the system was accidentally turned off for a crucial point, leading to a disputed call by the umpire. While the umpire was found to have followed existing protocols, the All England Club stated the error cannot be repeated and will consider implementing a video review system in the future.</p>

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder chose not to pursue the Test record for the highest individual score, declaring his innings at 367 not out against Zimbabwe. Mulder was just 33 runs shy of Brian Lara's iconic record of 400 not out. He explained the decision was made in the team's best interest but also out of respect for the West Indies legend, stating that someone of Lara's stature should retain such a special record. Mulder's score is now the fifth-highest individual total in Test cricket history and the highest ever by a South African.</p>

          <p>An extensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no incriminating "client list" associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and confirmed his 2019 death was a suicide. The findings, detailed in a two-page memo, contradict long-standing conspiracy theories suggesting Epstein was murdered to protect high-profile associates. Investigators found no credible evidence to predicate new investigations against uncharged third parties. The review aims to provide transparency and counter misinformation surrounding the case, reaffirming the official narrative of Epstein's death while in federal custody.</p>
