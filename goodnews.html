          <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Walmart, Costco, and Amazon are best positioned to handle upcoming tariff-related price increases, citing their strong balance sheets and scale. Cramer noted that Walmart's CFO warned of potential price hikes due to tariffs, but these retailers can negotiate better deals with suppliers and leverage private label brands to mitigate costs. He emphasized that these companies can absorb tighter profit margins due to their high sales volumes, maintaining competitive pricing for consumers. Cramer's Charitable Trust holds positions in Costco and Amazon, reflecting his confidence in their ability to navigate the tariff environment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Belgium's parliament voted to scrap its planned nuclear phaseout, reversing a policy adopted over two decades ago, according to DW. The decision comes after the country delayed the phaseout by 10 years due to energy uncertainty caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The move aims to secure a realistic and resilient energy model for the country's economic, environmental, and strategic future. Other European countries like the Netherlands, Sweden, and Italy are also considering building new nuclear plants, while Germany is facing increasing pressure to reverse its own nuclear phaseout pledge.</p>

Trump has also urged Syria to recognize Israel and take steps to combat terrorism.

Medicare supplemental insurance can help cover costs not included in regular Medicare, while long-term care insurance can cover expenses associated with nursing homes, assisted living facilities, or in-home caretakers. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides a financial benefit to beneficiaries after death.

It also found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to distinct genetic traits.
