          <p>A significant technology outage impacted several major online platforms, including Google, OpenAI, Spotify, and Amazon Web Services, causing disruptions for tens of thousands of users. Reports of issues surged around 2:00 PM EST, peaking approximately 30 minutes later before gradually subsiding for most platforms. Cloudflare indicated that intermittent failures were affecting some of its services, attributing the source of the outage to Google Cloud. While most services were restored by late afternoon, some platforms, such as Ecobee, continued to monitor the situation. The outage affected a wide array of services, ranging from communication and collaboration tools to entertainment and e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>The Marines are set to begin operations in Los Angeles, coordinating with the National Guard in anticipation of nationwide anti-Trump protests. Reportedly, 700 Marines were dispatched by President Trump to Seal Beach for nonlethal weapons training, including hand-to-hand combat and crowd control, before moving to Los Angeles for familiarization training alongside the National Guard. While tasked with protecting federal property and law enforcement, the deployment has drawn criticism due to its estimated $134 million cost to taxpayers. Defense Secretary Hegseth defended the deployment as necessary to maintain law and order and protect law enforcement agents. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has seemingly reversed his stance on Chinese students studying in the United States, expressing strong support for them and pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized that allowing Chinese nationals to study in the US is beneficial for both the students and the country, particularly for American schools and companies. He also noted that preventing them from staying would lead to them starting businesses in their home countries instead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate is considering several changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," including adjustments to SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Senators are aiming to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path. Key changes under consideration include lessening the burden on states imposed by the House's SNAP proposal, lowering the cap on state and local tax deductions, reducing the amount of money allocated for border security, and reforming Medicaid. These changes could face challenges in both the House and Senate as lawmakers work towards President Trump's July 4 deadline.</p>
