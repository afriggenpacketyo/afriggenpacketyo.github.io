This change is projected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, along with ¬£13 million for food charities. While the rule change has been largely welcomed, some critics suggest that other measures, like lifting the two-child limit, would be more effective at reducing child poverty. </p>

          <p>A rare oil portrait of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, painted in 1931 in the UK, will be auctioned in London next month. The painting, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is believed to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for. The portrait was created when Gandhi went to London for the second Round Table conference, held to discuss constitutional reforms for India. The works remained in the artist's collection until her death in 1989, after which it was passed down through her family. </p>

          <h2>Call for Police Dog Pensions to Support Retired Heroes</h2>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is calling for police dogs to be supported with a pension to help pay for vet costs after their years of service. Each year, 50 to 70 dogs retire and are often adopted by members of the public or their former handlers, but they frequently come with complicated medical needs. Laura Meller, who has adopted three former service animals, has spent an estimated ¬£12,000 looking after them. The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of ¬£3,000 more a year compared with taking on an equivalent dog. </p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has made a pitch to WWE legend Paul "Triple H" Levesque to bring WrestleMania, the wrestling promotion's biggest event, to London. Khan told CNBC's Tania Bryer that he would "love for WrestleMania to come to London." Speculation about London as a potential destination has been ongoing since 2023, when John Cena supported the idea. If the event were to come to London, it would be the first time it is hosted outside of North America, opening a completely new market for the WWE. </p>
