          <p>Local elections in parts of England are underway, marking the first major electoral test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Labour retained several mayoralties but with reduced majorities, while Reform UK showed strong performance, coming in second in all Labour-held mayoral races. A recount is ongoing in Runcorn and Helsby, with Reform and Labour separated by only four votes. Results from council elections are expected later, with Reform aiming for gains against both Conservatives and Labour, and these early results indicate potential shifts in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused significant debris accumulation. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on the sport fish population by comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Initial findings suggest that things look within normal range, but the full data will provide a clearer picture. Sport fishing is crucial to the area's tourism, and the cleanup efforts are nearly complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>

The appointment highlights the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, but also raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the delegation of duties.</p>
