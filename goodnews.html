        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral video claiming to show President Trump giving a "Nazi salute" at a Fourth of July White House event has been fact-checked and found to be misrepresented. The authentic, unaltered clip shows the president blowing two kisses to the crowd and waving, gestures which do not align with the historical definition of a Nazi or Roman salute. Despite widespread circulation on platforms like TikTok and X with captions making the false claim, the context shows a standard interaction with supporters. A White House spokesperson dismissed the claim as untrue, clarifying the president's actions during the fireworks celebration.</p>

          <p>An online rumor claiming that U.S. Representative Jasmine Crockett personally donated $25 million to victims of the recent Texas floods has been thoroughly debunked as false. The story, which circulated widely on Facebook, was fabricated and spread through websites designed to generate advertising revenue with sensational, fictional content. There is no evidence from news reports or Crockett's financial disclosures to support the claim; her declared assets are far below the rumored donation amount. The congresswoman has expressed her condolences and prayers for the victims but made no such donation.</p>

Rather than undertaking a lengthy overhaul of its data centers for liquid cooling, AWS developed this new plug-in solution to support the scale of its operations.

In contrast, Real Madrid appeared shapeless and disjointed, with new star Kylian Mbappé struggling to make an impact against his former team. The result emphasizes PSG's successful post-Mbappé rebuild and raises questions about Madrid's ability to integrate its star attackers into a cohesive unit.</p>
