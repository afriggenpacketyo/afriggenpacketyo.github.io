          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlock due to Justice Amy Coney Barrett's recusal, upheld the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision to block the state from establishing the nation's first religious charter school funded by taxpayer dollars. The ruling leaves in place the lower court's judgment that taxpayer-funded religious schools violate the establishment clause of the First Amendment. This decision avoids setting a nationwide precedent, meaning the issue may be revisited in future cases from other states. Advocates for public and independent charter schools are relieved, fearing that a ruling in favor of the Catholic school would disrupt education systems nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court deadlocked in a 4-4 decision, effectively blocking Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leaving the court evenly divided. The decision upholds the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling that the school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, would violate the state's constitution and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. This outcome prevents public funds from directly supporting religious curriculum and activities, maintaining the nonsectarian requirement for charter schools in Oklahoma.</p>

The company, founded in 2014, will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "HNGE." While the IPO values Hinge Health at around $2.6 billion, this is significantly lower than its private market valuation of $6.2 billion in 2021. The digital health sector is closely watching Hinge's IPO, as it has seen few public offerings since 2021, facing challenges in recovering from a post-Covid slowdown.</p>

This enhanced deduction would be available from 2025 to 2029 and could lower taxes for many seniors.
