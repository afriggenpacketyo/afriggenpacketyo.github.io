          <p>A senior Chinese economic official has indicated a policy window for providing stronger support to the private sector, acknowledging that the country's business environment still has room for improvement. This follows the passage of a law earlier this year designed to ensure equal legal treatment and protections for non-state firms. The official emphasized the importance of stabilizing market sentiment, revitalizing investor confidence, and strengthening property rights. The government also aims to regulate law enforcement concerning businesses and enhance overall government services, signaling a concerted effort to foster a more predictable and equitable operating landscape for private enterprises in China's economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully disrupted a sophisticated telecommunications network in the New York tri-state area, which presented a significant threat to the city's communication infrastructure, particularly during the UN General Assembly. This operation, the largest of its kind, uncovered 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute, with the potential to disable cell phone towers and block emergency services. Officials indicated the network was "well organized and well funded," used by foreign governments and known organized crime groups. Although no arrests have been made, the immediate threat to New York and the UN has been neutralized.</p>

It directly refutes President Trump's unsubstantiated claims linking Tylenol (paracetamol) use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism. Medical organizations worldwide, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, affirm the drug's safety and efficacy as the primary treatment for pain and fever in pregnancy. The article emphasizes that scientific consensus points to autism being a result of complex genetic and environmental factors, not a single cause like Tylenol, thereby debunking misinformation.</p>

          <h2>Creator Updates Retirement "4% Rule" to 4.7% Amid Evolving Financial Landscape</h2>

          <p>Financial planner William Bengen, the originator of the popular "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has revised it to a "4.7% rule," citing more advanced research and significant shifts in the modern financial environment. The updated guideline, detailed in his new book, now considers seven diverse asset classes, including various US and international stocks and bonds, offering a more generous yet "safemax" withdrawal rate. This adjustment aims to accommodate factors like longer lifespans and increased living costs since the rule's 1994 inception. The article stresses that while the 4.7% serves as a useful benchmark, individual financial planning should always be tailored to personal circumstances and discussed with a financial advisor.

          <p>This article delves into the common decline in sex drive experienced by many individuals after childbirth, attributing it to a combination of physical, hormonal, and emotional factors. Dr. Jennifer Lincoln, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist, highlights drastic drops in estrogen and progesterone, which can cause vaginal dryness and make sex painful, alongside the physical healing required post-delivery. Reality TV personality Holly Hagan-Blyth shared her personal experience, stressing the importance of transparent communication with her husband to alleviate pressure and misinterpretations. The article advises that couples facing persistent difficulties should consider seeking professional support, such as counseling or sex therapy, to navigate these significant relationship changes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the profound ethical dilemmas inherent in modern embryo testing, including PGT-A and polygenic screening, for selecting specific traits like disease resistance or intelligence. It critically examines the fine line between pursuing a healthier baby and engaging in "eugenics-y" practices, especially given the substantial costs that could exacerbate societal inequalities. The piece also highlights scientific uncertainties, such as pleiotropy, where single genes influence multiple traits, and warns of potential psychological harm if children perceive they failed to meet parental expectations based on genetic selection. Ultimately, the article advocates for parents to make "good enough" decisions, resisting commercial pressures to optimize every aspect of their child's biology.</p>

          <p>A UCLA annual survey debunks the prevailing "NIMBY" stereotype in Los Angeles, revealing that an overwhelming 86% of Angelenos support building more apartments, including within their own neighborhoods and on streets predominantly featuring single-family homes. This data contradicts the assumption that residents oppose increased housing density, offering a clear mandate for city leaders. The article advocates for Mayor Karen Bass to restore and potentially expand her affordable housing plan, Executive Directive 1, to leverage this public consensus. It emphasizes the importance of using representative survey data to guide policy decisions, rather than being swayed by vocal minorities, to effectively address the city's urgent housing scarcity.</p>

          <p>An archaeological mission has unearthed evidence of a long-submerged ancient Egyptian harbor near the Taposiris Magna Temple, a significant discovery that enriches understanding of the Ptolemaic period and advances the search for Queen Cleopatra VII's lost tomb. Led by Dr. Kathleen Martinez, the team utilized advanced sonar to map a former shoreline and inner harbor, yielding artifacts like anchors and amphorae. Martinez, who has dedicated two decades to this quest, hypothesizes Cleopatra chose Taposiris Magna—a religiously significant site outside Roman control—as her final resting place to evade Roman capture or posthumous humiliation. The team is set to commence its first underwater excavations, hoping to unravel more mysteries.</p>

She also lauded the "power of the people" for influencing Disney's decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's show following his suspension, citing consumer boycotts. Furthermore, Harris voiced strong support for California's Proposition 50, a redistricting ballot measure backed by Newsom, which aims to increase Democratic representation.
