        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard soldiers in Illinois. The administration had intended to use the troops to protect federal facilities and agents in Chicago from what it described as violent protesters. However, Judge April Perry ruled that the deployment would likely "add fuel to the fire," expressing skepticism about the federal government's claims of violence and suggesting the move was rooted in political animus. The order will remain in effect for two weeks, a decision praised by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker but opposed by the White House, which has vowed to appeal.</p>

Fellow rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart also had a strong performance, throwing for one touchdown and running for another, finishing with 195 passing yards. The Giants' defense was also effective, sacking Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts three times and forcing his first interception of the season, contributing to Philadelphia's recent struggles.</p>

          <p>Chinese regulators have announced new measures to address intense and disorderly price competition within certain industries. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) will guide industry associations to establish reasonable prices based on average production costs. Authorities are now required to monitor markets for signs of price wars, warn businesses engaging in such practices, and conduct cost investigations when necessary. This policy aims to prevent self-destructive cost-cutting that harms industry development, product innovation, and the overall health of the national economy, with legal action threatened for any violations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured their spot in the National League Championship Series with a thrilling 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in 11 innings. The game ended on a critical error when Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering, with the bases loaded and two outs, fumbled a ground ball and made a panicked, errant throw home. This allowed the winning run to score, clinching the series for the Dodgers three games to one and keeping their hopes for a second consecutive World Series title alive. The dramatic conclusion followed a tense pitching duel and highlighted the intense, high-stakes nature of the postseason matchup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for South Korean semiconductor giants SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics surged to record highs, jumping 10% and nearly 6% respectively. This boost followed news of potential collaboration between OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which is expected to increase demand for high-performance memory chips used in artificial intelligence technologies. The rally in Asian markets reflects broader investor optimism in the AI sector, further fueled by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments about strong demand and the company's involvement in funding Elon Musk's xAI startup. This performance highlights the significant financial impact of the ongoing AI boom on global technology companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maine's term-limited Democratic Governor, Janet Mills, is reportedly planning to launch a campaign for the U.S. Senate next week. She is expected to challenge longtime Republican Senator Susan Collins in what is anticipated to be one of the most closely watched races in the upcoming midterm elections. Mills, who previously served as the state's attorney general, has been a top recruit for national Democrats. Her entry would position the Maine Senate race as a key opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a Republican-held seat and contest the current GOP majority in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party leadership race positions her to become the country's first female prime minister and signals a potential ideological shift. Known as a staunch conservative and nationalist, her rise could mark a departure from the centrist pragmatism of her predecessors. This article analyzes how her leadership might reshape Japan's domestic and foreign policy, with a focus on reviving Abenomics with a nationalist twist, including state-led industrial investment and a stronger defense posture. Her approach could also alter economic relationships with Southeast Asian partners, tying aid and investment more closely to strategic cooperation.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a package of bills aimed at strengthening the California FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort, following massive losses from recent wildfires. The new laws will allow the plan to issue bonds and secure lines of credit to cover catastrophic claims, helping to stabilize its finances. Additionally, the legislation increases legislative oversight of the FAIR Plan's governing committee, which has been criticized for a lack of transparency. These reforms are designed to make California's insurance market more resilient as the state continues to face the growing threat of climate-fueled firestorms.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, which includes an immediate ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages. Following the Israeli cabinet's approval, the Israeli military will withdraw to an agreed-upon line, controlling about 53% of the Gaza Strip. In exchange for the release of 20 living hostages and the remains of 28 others, Israel will free approximately 1,950 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The plan also calls for a significant increase in humanitarian aid, with hundreds of trucks expected to enter Gaza daily to address the ongoing famine.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that prohibits streaming services from playing commercials at a volume significantly louder than the program content. The bill, SB 576, was inspired by the experience of a legislative staffer whose infant was repeatedly awakened by blaring ads. While a similar federal law, the CALM Act, already applies to broadcast and cable television, it did not cover streaming platforms like Netflix and Prime Video. By closing this loophole, California's law is expected to set a national precedent, compelling streaming companies to standardize ad volume for all users, not just those in the state.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson just one week before it was scheduled, ordering a review of his case based on new scientific evidence. Roberson was sentenced to death for the 2002 death of his two-year-old daughter, a conviction based on a diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome. His defense team argues that this diagnosis is now considered unreliable "junk science" and that the child actually died from severe pneumonia. The court's decision allows for the trial court to re-evaluate the conviction in light of evolving medical understanding, reflecting a growing trend of exonerations in similar cases.</p>

          <p>A nearly complete skeleton discovered on Dorset's Jurassic Coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a prehistoric marine reptile. Named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "sword dragon of Dorset," the dolphin-sized creature is distinguished by its long, sword-like snout and is the only known example of its kind. Scientists believe it lived around 185 million years ago, filling an important gap in the evolutionary record of ichthyosaurs. Marks on the skull suggest this individual may have been killed by a bite from a much larger predator, offering a glimpse into the dangers of Mesozoic oceans.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law making it illegal for veterinarians to declaw cats for non-therapeutic reasons. The procedure, which involves amputating the first bone in a cat's toes, will now be permitted only in cases of medical necessity for the animal's health. Authored by Assemblymember Alex Lee, the bill was supported by animal advocates who describe the practice as an outdated and inhumane mutilation performed for owner convenience. While the California Veterinary Medical Association opposed the bill, arguing it limits professional judgment, the law follows New York's 2019 ban and similar restrictions in several California cities.</p>
