        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warsaw's pro-EU mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, secured a narrow victory in the first round of Poland's presidential election with 31.36% of the vote, closely followed by national-conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki at 29.54%. With a runoff vote scheduled for June 1, the support from far-right candidates, who garnered a combined 21.15% in the first round, will be crucial. Trzaskowski's potential win would empower Prime Minister Donald Tusk to advance his EU-friendly reform agenda, which has faced resistance from the current nationalist president. The opposition, led by the right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS), supports Nawrocki. Relevant context includes Poland's ongoing political divisions between pro-EU centrists and national conservatives.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister Taku Eto faced criticism after stating he does not need to buy rice due to receiving ample supplies from supporters, amidst rising rice prices affecting households. This occurred as his ministry released rice from emergency stockpiles to curb prices that have doubled due to a poor harvest. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called Eto's remarks "very problematic" and apologized for appointing him. The government has faced scrutiny for its delayed response in releasing stockpiled rice, exacerbating consumer struggles with rising food and energy costs. The context involves public dissatisfaction with the government's handling of soaring rice prices.</p>

While this move is projected to increase production costs by 10%, Leapmotor intends to maintain current prices, focusing on expanding its sales and service network to boost volume. Leapmotor aims for at least 10% of its global vehicle sales to originate outside China by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Weather forecasts, crucial for daily planning and safety, rely on a global network of measurements collected from satellites, Doppler radar, and automated weather stations. These measurements, including wind speed, precipitation, and barometric pressure, are fed into supercomputers that run complex mathematical models to predict future weather patterns. Human forecasters then interpret the computer-generated results and translate them into accessible formats for the public, such as smartphone apps and TV broadcasts. The National Weather Service provides free, detailed local forecasts, and issues warnings for severe weather events.

          <p>Verizon has ended its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies to gain FCC approval for its $20 billion deal to buy Frontier Communications. The FCC cited Verizon's commitment to ending DEI-related practices in its approval announcement. Verizon is removing references to DEI from training materials and websites, ending bonuses tied to increasing the percentage of women or minorities, and dissolving its DEI-focused HR department. This move reflects a broader retreat from DEI across corporate America amid pressure from the Trump administration. The context involves the changing regulatory landscape surrounding DEI and the government's influence on corporate policies.</p>

          <h2>Vegan Diet Matches Meat for Muscle Gains in Strength Training</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that a vegan diet can be as effective as a meat-based diet for muscle gains during strength training, challenging previous assumptions about the superiority of animal protein. Studies have shown that plant protein can provide comparable muscle-building potential when consumed in sufficient quantities. While animal protein is generally of higher quality on a gram-for-gram basis, these differences become less significant in the context of a balanced diet. Mindful plant-based eating, with a variety of protein-rich foods, can deliver the necessary amino acids for muscle growth. The context involves changing perspectives on protein sources and the importance of balanced nutrition for fitness.</p>

          <h2>China's Economic Resilience Mutes Stimulus Speculation</h2>

          <p>Analysts suggest Beijing may be less inclined to implement aggressive fiscal stimulus measures in the upcoming quarter, as April's macroeconomic data indicates China's economic resilience against U.S. tariff headwinds. Major investment banks have already revised their growth outlook for China's economy following a 90-day tariff truce with the United States and a supportive policy package from China's central bank. While economic growth slowed in April compared to the first quarter, the deceleration was not significant. The context involves the ongoing trade tensions between China and the U.S. and China's efforts to maintain economic stability.</p>
