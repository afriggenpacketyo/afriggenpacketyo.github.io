          <p>The Princess of Wales, Catherine, has co-authored an essay warning that the overuse of smartphones and other digital devices is causing an "epidemic of disconnection" within families. She argues that while technology promises connection, it often results in people being physically present but mentally absent, undermining the warm relationships essential for lifelong health. The essay, part of her early years education campaign, highlights the risk of raising a generation that is simultaneously more connected digitally and more isolated in reality. This disconnection impedes the development of crucial social and emotional skills in children, creating significant challenges for their future well-being.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a review of what it calls "outdated" licensing rules, which could lead to extended opening hours for pubs and bars in England and Wales. The proposed reforms aim to support the hospitality sector by cutting red tape, making it easier for venues to serve food outdoors and host live music to boost economic growth. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the goal is to help local pubs thrive, framing them as the heart of communities. However, critics, including the charity Alcohol Change UK, have warned that relaxing these rules could lead to increased antisocial behavior and place additional strain on emergency services.</p>

          <p>HSBC has proposed to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private in a deal valuing the Hong Kong-based lender at over $37 billion. The offer represents a 33% premium over Hang Seng's recent average share price, causing its stock to surge nearly 30% while HSBC's shares fell. HSBC, which already owns about 63% of Hang Seng, stated the move is a strategic priority to grow its presence in Hong Kong and reflects confidence in the city's role as a global financial hub. The privatization aims to resolve governance issues associated with dual listings and allow for greater investment in Hang Seng's brand and services. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal is expected to significantly reduce tariffs and boost annual trade by over £25 billion by 2040. During the visit, Starmer also announced that three Bollywood films will be produced in the UK starting in 2026, highlighting the deepening cultural and business connections between the two nations.</p>

He stated that cultural and institutional differences should not hinder cooperation, emphasizing the need for mutual understanding of each other's core interests. The visit is part of Beijing's efforts to improve relations with the European Union, which have been strained by ongoing trade disputes. These tensions were recently highlighted by the EU's proposal of measures to protect its steel industry from what it describes as overcapacity originating from China, underscoring the challenging diplomatic landscape.</p>

          <p>Scotland's national football team has a realistic chance of securing a World Cup play-off spot by the end of the week, following a strong start to their qualifying campaign. Head coach Steve Clarke is targeting victories in two upcoming home games against Greece and Belarus, which would take their points total to ten. This would guarantee at least a second-place standing in their group. If Greece also loses its subsequent match against Denmark, Scotland's play-off position would be confirmed with two games to spare, leaving them to compete with Denmark for automatic qualification in November.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough, largely attributed to the personal intervention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who applied significant pressure on both sides. While the agreement facilitates the release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, it represents only the first phase of a broader plan and does not guarantee a permanent end to the war. Key, contentious issues remain unresolved, including the disarmament of Hamas, the long-term governance of Gaza, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's need to navigate political opposition from ultranationalist coalition partners who oppose the deal.</p>

          <p>China has successfully switched on a first-of-its-kind thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring an innovative dual-tower design. The plant uses nearly 27,000 mirrors to focus sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, which heats molten salt to store thermal energy. This stored heat is then used to create steam that drives turbines, allowing the plant to generate electricity continuously, even after sunset or on cloudy days. According to state media, the dual-tower system is approximately 25% more effective than a single-tower design and requires fewer mirrors, marking a significant advancement in concentrated solar power technology.</p>

The regulator's primary goal is to ensure the financial sustainability of clubs and protect them from irresponsible ownership.

          <p>Following the announcement of a peace deal in Gaza, attention has turned to the Nobel Peace Prize, an award President Donald Trump has openly coveted. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which recently concluded its secret deliberations, has faced an unprecedented public campaign from Trump and his allies, who argue his diplomatic efforts merit the prestigious honor. The committee maintains its independence from political pressure, but the high-profile nature of the Gaza negotiations has made Trump a prominent, if polarizing, figure in this year's considerations. The final decision will be announced on Friday, concluding months of speculation.</p>

A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team was called to the scene, where they determined the device was safe to transport.

          <p>The recent agreement on the first phase of a Gaza peace plan is being attributed largely to the direct and forceful intervention of U.S. President Donald Trump. Unlike previous failed attempts, Trump personally engaged in the process, applying significant pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and leveraging his relationships with Hamas patrons Qatar and Turkey to compel the group to release its hostages. By making himself the face of the deal, he has created strong political incentives for all parties to adhere to the terms. This hands-on approach overcame the political inertia that had previously stalled negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release.</p>
