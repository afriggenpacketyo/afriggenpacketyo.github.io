          <h2>Homeowners in Coastal Regions Adopt Climate-Resilient Building Designs Amid Worsening Storms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 20:08:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As forecasters predict an increasingly active hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient home designs. These structures often feature aerodynamic shapes to reduce wind pressure, reinforced roofs, and foundations anchored deep into the ground with flood vents. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in building these hurricane-resistant houses, which are rated to withstand winds up to 190 mph. While costing about 10% more than traditional construction, these homes can lead to long-term savings, including significantly lower insurance premiums, and offer greater peace of mind in storm-prone areas.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting at the White House to discuss the ongoing war in Gaza and the potential for a ceasefire. The discussion came as a U.S. envoy indicated that Israel and Hamas were down to a single remaining issue to secure a 60-day truce, which would include the release of some hostages. While Trump stated that talks were progressing well, Qatar, a key mediator, cautioned that more time was needed to reach an agreement. Netanyahu affirmed his goal to dismantle Hamas's capabilities but acknowledged that negotiators were actively working towards a deal.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President JD Vance, to discuss security and regional stability. The visit occurred amid ongoing ceasefire negotiations in Gaza and follows criticism from some lawmakers over recent U.S. military actions against Iran. In his remarks, Netanyahu emphasized the strong coordination with the Trump administration, stating it has created new opportunities for peace while reaffirming the goal of dismantling Hamas. The discussions highlight the diplomatic efforts to navigate the complex political landscape of the Middle East and maintain the U.S.-Israel alliance.</p>

          <p>China has significantly accelerated its development of offshore wind energy, adding over 4.4 gigawatts (GW) of capacity in the first half of 2025, matching its total for all of 2024. A report from Global Energy Monitor projects China will install at least 9 GW this year, accounting for more than half of all global additions. This expansion is part of a broader government strategy to advance the nation's marine economy, with strong central support through financial subsidies and strategic planning. The push is exemplified by the recent operational start of the country's farthest offshore wind project, located 85.5 km from the coast in Jiangsu province.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an Instagram post by television personality Gemma Collins for illegally promoting a prescription-only weight-loss medication. The post advertised the Swedish brand Yazen, a service that combines an app with prescription drugs. Although the specific medication was not named, the ASA ruled that the advert illegally promoted such drugs to the general public. This action was part of a broader crackdown by the regulator, which banned nine similar adverts from various companies for breaching rules against the direct-to-consumer promotion of prescription medications.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's new £60m signing, João Pedro, made a stunning first start for the club, scoring two goals against his former side Fluminense in the Club World Cup semi-final. The Brazilian forward, signed to bolster Chelsea's attack, showcased his skill with two brilliant strikes that secured his team's place in the final. His performance highlighted his versatility, as he was involved in link-up play all over the pitch, not just acting as a traditional striker. The impressive debut suggests the 23-year-old could be the effective and dynamic forward the club has been seeking under its new ownership.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed a bullish outlook on the online used car retailer Carvana, recommending it to investors as a long-term holding. He praised the company's convenient online sales model and its potential to capture more market share in the fragmented auto sales industry. Cramer noted that Carvana is also positioned to benefit from potential interest rate cuts, which make financing easier, and from new U.S. tariffs on foreign automakers that could make used cars more attractive. Despite the stock's recent strong performance, he advised investors to start with a small position and wait for a pullback to buy more due to its volatile nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at all U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the policy is effective immediately, citing dramatic evolution in security technology over the past two decades. The rule was first implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident. While passengers will still need to remove laptops and liquids from bags, this change aims to streamline the airport experience for millions of travelers, though TSA may still require shoe removal for additional screening on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a massive transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific coast. The proposed 4,500-kilometer (2,800-mile) project would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the port of Chancay, Peru, potentially shortening shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days. The agreement, signed between Brazil's state-owned Infra S.A. and a subsidiary of China State Railway Group, initiates a five-year study of the project's technical, environmental, and economic viability. Estimates for the ambitious infrastructure project place the potential cost upwards of $70 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A central government campaign in China aimed at curbing wasteful spending and potential corruption among civil servants is having unintended social consequences. The strict rules, which ban officials from consuming liquor and "high-end dishes" at official receptions, have made many public employees fearful of dining out at all, even for purely social or family events. This has created a climate of fear where even casual meals can be perceived as a violation, leading some officials to avoid restaurants and social gatherings entirely. The measures are part of a broader effort to address public resentment over official extravagance and reinforce discipline within the government.</p>
