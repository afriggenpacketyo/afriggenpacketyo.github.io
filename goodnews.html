Raleigh, who entered the All-Star break as the major league's home run leader, is the first catcher and the first switch-hitter to ever win the competition. He advanced through the rounds with impressive hitting from both sides of the plate, pitched to by his father. The victory marks the second time a Mariners player has won the derby, following Ken Griffey Jr.</p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations and keeping it on track to meet the government's annual target of 5%. Despite this, the growth rate slowed from the previous quarter, and indicators like retail sales and real estate investment showed signs of weakness. Industrial output, however, expanded more than anticipated. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged an unstable external environment and insufficient domestic demand, while economists remain cautious about future headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced its intention to restart sales of its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. The sales of these chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development follows a preliminary trade deal between Washington and Beijing and lobbying efforts by Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, who argued against the restrictions. Huang also announced a new, fully compliant GPU designed for industrial applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A four-person crew, including retired NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, has departed the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule to begin their journey back to Earth. The mission, organized by Axiom Space, included astronauts from India, Poland, and Hungary, marking the first time in over 40 years their respective government programs have sent astronauts on a human spaceflight. After spending 18 days conducting research in microgravity, the crew is expected to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. This flight was the fourth commercial mission to the ISS arranged by Axiom Space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's annual salary report for top earners often excludes many of its biggest stars, creating an incomplete picture of talent compensation. This is because the list only includes individuals directly employed and paid by the license fee, not those hired through independent production companies, including the BBC's own commercial arm, BBC Studios. Consequently, stars from major shows like 'Strictly Come Dancing,' 'The Traitors,' and 'The Apprentice' do not appear. This distinction is made to allow BBC Studios to compete fairly in the commercial market without disclosing its talent fees.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the United States. The administrative stay, granted after a motion by the advocacy group Casa, will remain in effect until July 21. The group filed a lawsuit challenging the administration's decision in April to end deportation protections for Afghans and Cameroonians, arguing that conditions in their home countries do not warrant the change. The Department of Homeland Security has until Wednesday to respond to the court's order.</p>

The method involves a novel way to rapidly cool forged turbine discs made of superalloy, a core engine component. The quality and durability of these discs, which must withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, have been a persistent challenge for China's aerospace industry. This technological advancement is crucial as China works to develop advanced engines for its next-generation fighter jets, an area where it has historically lagged.</p>
