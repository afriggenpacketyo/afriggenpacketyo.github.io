          <p>CBS News has launched a new local station in Atlanta, featuring an immersive, tech-forward newsroom designed to move beyond traditional formats. In just five weeks, the station hired 50 staff members, attracting a mix of veteran journalists and local talent returning to their hometown. Anchors and reporters expressed excitement about the entrepreneurial energy of the new venture, which is backed by the resources of the national CBS News organization. The station, CBS News Atlanta, began broadcasting with evening newscasts and plans to expand its programming to include a morning show.</p>

          <p>According to Vanguard's 2025 "How America Saves" report, households earning $150,000 or more have an average 401(k) balance of approximately $336,000, with a median balance of $188,000. This data highlights a significant savings gap even within the upper-income bracket, suggesting that a high salary does not automatically lead to a large retirement fund. The article notes that for many affluent individuals, the 401(k) is just one component of a broader financial strategy that often includes brokerage accounts, IRAs, real estate, and other investments.

          <p>On CNBC's "Investing Club," host Jim Cramer strongly advocated for purchasing Boeing stock, stating he wants to "pound the table" on the aerospace giant. The recommendation comes after Boeing's shares declined following reports of delays in certifying its new 777X jet, presenting what Cramer sees as a buying opportunity. The show also discussed China's antitrust allegations against Nvidia, which Cramer believes are politically motivated and may be resolved through broader trade negotiations. He suggested that positive movement in U.S.-China trade talks reduces his concern over the investigation's impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Stephen Graham won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor for his performance in the Netflix drama "Adolescence." In his acceptance speech, Graham, who is of mixed-race heritage and grew up in Kirkby, Merseyside, expressed his humility, stating that such an honor doesn't typically happen to someone with his background. He credited his father for sparking his love of film and paid an emotional tribute to his wife, Hannah Walters, calling her his "rock" and "soulmate." Graham is known for his acclaimed roles in productions like "This Is England" and has spoken openly about his past mental health struggles.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged after a recent antitrust ruling delivered lighter-than-feared penalties, with a judge deciding against forcing the divestment of its Chrome browser. Alphabet's shares have risen over 30% this year, significantly outperforming the Nasdaq index. The milestone comes as the company navigates increased competition in the artificial intelligence sector and heightened regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <h2>Common Mistakes Can Significantly Increase the Cost of Credit Card Debt</h2>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates near 22%, consumers are warned against simple errors that can make balances more expensive. Paying a bill late can trigger immediate fees and the loss of a grace period, causing interest to accrue on new purchases instantly. Carrying a balance allows interest to compound daily, rapidly increasing the total amount owed, while high credit utilization can damage credit scores. The article advises consumers to explore options like 0% balance transfers or debt consolidation loans to manage and reduce high-interest debt effectively.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom are set to announce more than $10 billion in economic deals during President Donald Trump's state visit to London. According to senior U.S. officials, the agreements will focus on three main areas: a new science and technology partnership, cooperation on civil nuclear power, and advancements in defense technology. The visit includes meetings with King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This marks Trump's second state visit to the UK, with the primary goal of strengthening economic and foreign policy ties between the two allied nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, Trump argued the shift would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. This revives a proposal from his first term that did not result in policy changes. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides essential transparency and timely information for investors.

          <p>A CBS News analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark found that renewable sources are the most cost-competitive for producing electricity. According to data from investment bank Lazard, onshore wind and utility-scale solar are cheaper to generate than coal, natural gas, or nuclear power, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report notes that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are very low. The analysis also considers the impact of the Trump administration's policies, which are phasing out clean energy incentives while expanding tax breaks for fossil fuels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate this week, which could provide relief for consumers with variable-rate debt. Experts advise several key financial moves in anticipation of lower rates, including aggressively paying down high-interest debt like credit cards, as the rate reduction will be modest. Savers are encouraged to lock in current high yields with CDs or high-yield savings accounts before rates drop. The move could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable and potentially unlocking inventory as more homeowners decide to sell. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Monday, a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments, U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF). This action suggests some minor tightness in the financial system as banks sought overnight cash to meet funding obligations. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding shortages. The demand for cash coincided with a large Treasury security settlement, pushing the cost of overnight borrowing slightly above the interest rate the Fed pays on bank reserves. Analysts believe the liquidity pressure is temporary and not indicative of a major funding squeeze. (not investment advice)</p>
