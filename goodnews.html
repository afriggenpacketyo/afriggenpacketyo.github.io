        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Discontent is growing in the Tokyo metropolitan area due to proposals to construct giant data centers in residential areas, leading to industry groups working to smooth relations between locals concerned about the "eerie" facilities' imposing nature and the companies that operate them. Some projects are being scrapped due to opposition from residents worried about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of their natural light. Municipalities are taking action, with Tokyo's Koto Ward requiring data center business owners to install signs announcing construction earlier and to clearly indicate the location of heat-emitting outdoor units. Inzai has begun considering whether to set restrictions on the construction of data centers near residential areas. It is important for business owners to disclose information and steadily work to build trust with the communities affected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest rate since late 2023, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Monday, in part helped by the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays. Retail sales last month jumped 6.4% from a year earlier, sharply beating analysts' estimates for a 5% growth in a Reuters poll and accelerating from the 5.1% growth in the previous month. Growth in industrial output slowed to 5.8% year on year in May from 6.1% in the prior month, coming in slightly weaker than analysts' expectations for a 5.9% rise. The rise of retail sales came as a surprise, likely boosted by the lasting effects from consumer goods trade-in program, though falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos surged as much as 15.23% Monday after it received a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The takeover bid led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG follows two confidential, non-binding and indicative proposals from the same consortium on Mar. 21 and Mar. 28, according to Santos. The consortium also includes the Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and global private equity firm Carlyle Group, offering a cash offer price of $5.76 (8.89 Australian dollars) per Santos share, which translates to a 27.73% premium from its closing price last Friday. Santos' board said it intends to "unanimously recommend" the company's shareholders to vote in favor of the potential transaction, in the absence of a superior proposal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has requested eight countries and regions to block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, a government source said Monday. It is a crime in Japan to gamble with overseas-based betting sites, prompting the government to address the issue by urging the operators to cut off access to their sites. Japan has moved to crack down on illegal gambling following media revelations that some professional athletes and celebrities have used online casinos. A police survey estimated that more than 3 million people in the country have gambled online, with authorities believing that approximately $8.6 billion is spent annually by gamblers in Japan.</p>

Ohtani had a successful pitching career with the Angels, going 38-19 with a 3.01 earned-run average over 86 starts since coming over from Japan before the 2018 season.

          <p>China's economic data sent mixed signals in May, with US tariffs continuing to weigh on the country‚Äôs manufacturing and exports but domestic consumption picking up slightly in the run-up to a major online shopping festival. Retail sales rose by 6.4 per cent in May, compared with the 5.1 per cent growth observed in April, exceeding forecasts. The stronger consumption figures came as China gears up for one of its largest online shopping festivals of the year on June 18, and with the government continuing to boost consumer spending via a large-scale trade-in programme for appliances and other household goods. Industrial output, pressured by US tariffs and fierce domestic competition, grew in May by 5.8 per cent, year on year, according to the NBS data.</p>
