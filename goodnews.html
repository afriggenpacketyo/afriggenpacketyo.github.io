          <p>Gap Inc. shares experienced a significant drop after the retailer announced that new tariffs could negatively impact its business by $100 million to $150 million. This projection accounts for mitigation efforts such as diversifying the supply chain and reducing reliance on China, which is expected to represent less than 3% of sourcing by year-end. Despite tariff concerns, Gap's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, with sales rising 2% to $3.46 billion and earnings per share at 51 cents versus an expected 45 cents. The company anticipates full-year sales growth of 1% to 2%, while navigating potential impacts from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, in an interview with "CBS Sunday Morning," revealed his conflicting views on the Trump administration, noting that while he agrees with much of what the administration does, he also has some differences of opinion. Musk explained that he feels "stuck in a bind" because he doesn't want to publicly criticize the administration but also doesn't want to be held responsible for all of its actions. He expressed disappointment with a recent budget bill passed by House Republicans. The interview occurred shortly before SpaceX's Starship experienced a setback during its ninth test flight and before Musk's departure from DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency).</p>

          <p>A federal court initially froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump, deeming them illegal and exceeding the president's legal authority. The ruling halted the 10% tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner and tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that Congress did not grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs. However, an appeals court temporarily halted this ruling, reinstating the tariffs pending further review. The White House defended the tariffs, citing trade deficits as a national emergency (not investment advice).</p>
