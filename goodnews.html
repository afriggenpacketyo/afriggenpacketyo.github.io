          <h2>WK Kellogg Shares Surge Over 50% on Reports of Potential Acquisition by Ferrero</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 16:51:07 EDT</div>

          <p>Stock for cereal manufacturer WK Kellogg experienced a dramatic jump of over 50% following a report that it may be acquired by Ferrero. The Italian confectionary giant, known for its hazelnut chocolates, is reportedly close to finalizing a deal valued at approximately $3 billion. This potential acquisition comes as WK Kellogg, which spun off from Kellanova in 2023, has seen its share price decline this year. The move reflects a broader trend of consolidation within the packaged foods industry as consumer preferences shift away from sugary cereals toward healthier or private-label options.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. The cryptocurrency's rise occurred as Nvidia's market capitalization touched the $4 trillion mark for the first time. Despite significant inflows into bitcoin ETFs, the digital currency has traded within a narrow range recently, but it remains a risk asset that often moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks. Investors anticipate further gains in the latter half of the year, driven by increased corporate buying and potential progress on crypto-related legislation in Congress.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses secured a crucial victory against the Netherlands, reviving their chances of advancing in the Euro 2025 tournament after a disappointing opening loss to France. Manager Sarina Wiegman made key tactical adjustments, including repositioning players Lauren James and Jess Carter, which proved highly effective and led to a commanding performance. The win demonstrated the team's resilience and creativity under pressure, with players and Wiegman expressing relief and renewed focus. With qualification for the quarter-finals now in their own hands, England must defeat Wales in their final group stage match.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has experienced a minor decline, dropping about 4% from its recent highs and prompting questions about whether now is an opportune time to invest. Despite the dip, the precious metal's value has seen a significant upward trend throughout 2024, with many analysts predicting it could eventually reach $4,000 per ounce. The article suggests that the current lower price may be a short-lived opportunity, as factors like inflation reports and Federal Reserve meetings could influence future price surges. Gold is often sought by investors as a hedge against inflation and a tool for portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Embeth Davidtz, known for roles in "Schindler's List" and "Junebug," has made her directorial debut with the film "Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight." The movie is based on Alexandra Fuller's memoir about growing up in colonial Rhodesia and serves as a way for Davidtz to process her own childhood in apartheid-era South Africa. She discusses the personal connection to the material, including witnessing institutional racism and dealing with her father's alcoholism, which she views as a response to the oppressive political system. The film aims to explore the insidious nature of casual, everyday racism from a white perspective.</p>

          <h2>Eli Manning No Longer Pursuing Ownership Stake in New York Giants, Citing High Cost</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the team, primarily because the soaring valuation has made it too expensive. With the franchise's valuation potentially reaching $10 billion, even a small percentage represents a massive investment. Manning also cited potential conflicts of interest with his role on ESPN's "ManningCast" and his ability to interact with players as other contributing factors. The decision comes as NFL team valuations are skyrocketing, with several recent sales exceeding initial estimates by a significant margin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has recommended relaxing a cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could improve access to homeownership for first-time buyers. The proposal would allow individual lenders to issue more than 15% of their new mortgages at a loan-to-income ratio higher than 4.5, potentially creating up to 36,000 new mortgages annually. Major lenders like Nationwide have welcomed the change, stating it will help those struggling with high rents and saving for a deposit. The recommendation aligns with a government push to stimulate economic growth, though millions of existing homeowners still face rising monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial Florida law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into the state. This decision keeps the law, passed by the Republican-controlled legislature, on hold while legal challenges proceed. A federal judge had previously ruled that the state law likely oversteps into the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The law, which imposes mandatory minimum sentences, was challenged by the ACLU and other advocacy groups who argue it is unconstitutional, cruel, and dangerous.</p>
