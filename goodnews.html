Nadler, first elected in 1992, served as the influential chair of the House Judiciary Committee and was a key figure in the first impeachment of former President Trump.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive exhibition titled "Listen to the Echo" is being held in Germany to celebrate the 70th birthday of acclaimed South African artist William Kentridge. The show, spanning venues in Essen and Dresden, features his diverse body of work, including his famous charcoal drawing animations, sculptures, tapestries, and multimedia installations. Kentridge's art often explores themes of colonialism, social power, and the legacy of apartheid in South Africa, reflecting his upbringing as the son of prominent anti-apartheid lawyers.</p>

          <h2>Tax Experts Highlight Opportunity for 0% Capital Gains Harvesting Under New Tax Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 09:00:33 EDT</div>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that new tax legislation from the Trump administration could create a "golden opportunity" for more investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket. With higher standard deductions and other new tax breaks for 2025, individuals with taxable income below $48,350 (or $96,700 for joint filers) can sell profitable assets without paying taxes on the gains. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka has stated that she "feels great" after drinking tequila, suggesting it is "much better on the body" than other liquors. While industry insiders note a trend of positioning high-quality, additive-free tequila as a "cleaner" spirit, health experts caution against viewing any alcohol as a wellness product. Experts clarify that while pure agave tequila has fewer congeners, which can worsen hangovers, alcohol itself still impairs muscle recovery and poses health risks, and no alcoholic beverage is truly "hangover-proof."</p>

Financial experts recommend comparing different online banks, which can offer higher rates and lower fees due to their reduced overhead costs compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>A federal jury in Arkansas has found that State Farm unfairly underpaid customers for cars deemed a "total loss" by systematically factoring in a "haggling discount" during valuation. The class-action lawsuit, representing 37,000 plaintiffs, argued that the software used by the insurer assumed customers could negotiate a lower price from used car dealers, a practice no longer common. The lead plaintiff was found to have been underpaid by approximately $600 on a $4,700 vehicle, and similar lawsuits are now being pursued in other states.</p>

          <p>The Manhattan office leasing market showed strong momentum in August, with activity suggesting that the year's total volume could surpass 40 million square feet for the first time since before the pandemic. This resurgence is driven by a return-to-office push, low unemployment, and a "flight to quality" as tenants seek out new or renovated buildings. Consequently, the availability rate for office space has fallen to its lowest point since January 2021, and average asking rents are beginning to rise. (not investment advice)</p>
