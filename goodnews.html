          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix reported record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, largely fueled by sustained, strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology. As a key supplier to AI giant Nvidia, the company has capitalized on the aggressive investments in artificial intelligence by major tech firms. SK Hynix expressed confidence for the remainder of 2025, citing stable customer inventory levels and anticipating continued healthy demand in the server market, projecting that its HBM sales will double compared to 2024.

          <p>A panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit has declared President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship to be invalid and unconstitutional. The court found that the policy, which sought to curtail citizenship for many children of undocumented immigrants, directly contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to alter the long-standing interpretation of citizenship for all persons born in the United States.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has finalized a settlement with the Trump administration, agreeing to pay over $220 million to resolve federal investigations into its handling of antisemitism on campus. In exchange for the payment, the government will restore $400 million in federal research grants that it had frozen. As part of the deal, Columbia will codify a series of reforms, including adopting a new definition of antisemitism, banning face masks intended to conceal identity, and having an independent monitor oversee its progress for the government.</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market is still largely considered a seller's market, some realtors see a slight shift occurring that may favor homebuyers as more properties become available. In May, the number of sellers nationally surpassed buyers at the highest rate since 2013, though median home prices still hit a record high in June. Experts advise that market conditions vary significantly by location, with inventory rising in places like Austin and Phoenix, while areas like Newark and Long Island remain highly competitive for buyers.

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a crucial extra-time winner against Germany, securing Spain's first-ever spot in a Women's Euro final. Her decisive goal completes a remarkable personal journey, as she had been hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began and was not fully fit. After starting the competition on the bench, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner demonstrated her world-class talent when it mattered most, capping a dominant but challenging semi-final performance for her resilient team in Zurich.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, has issued a unanimous advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. Spearheaded by the island nation of Vanuatu, the effort sought to clarify if polluters can be held legally accountable for climate change impacts. While not legally binding, the ruling establishes a powerful precedent, affirming that nations must use all available means to prevent climate harm and provide "full reparations" for damages caused, potentially influencing climate litigation worldwide.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which are designed to study the complex interaction between the solar wind and Earth's protective magnetic field. This phenomenon creates "space weather," which can disrupt and endanger critical infrastructure like satellites, power grids, and GPS communications. By flying in tandem formation, the identical spacecraft will provide precise measurements of how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere, helping scientists to better understand and eventually predict these potentially hazardous events.</p>

          <p>South Korea successfully avoided a technical recession, with its economy expanding by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. This growth marks a positive reversal from the 0.2% contraction experienced in the first quarter of the year. The expansion was primarily driven by a 0.7% increase in total consumption and a significant 4.2% rise in exports, particularly for semiconductors and petroleum products. The data provides a degree of stability amidst ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have opened their training camp widely regarded as a Super Bowl contender, boasting a mix of veteran talent like quarterback Matthew Stafford and rising young stars. However, the team faces several key concerns as they prepare for the upcoming season. These issues include managing Stafford's recent back soreness, addressing significant uncertainty at the left tackle position due to injuries and a new signing, and relying on a largely unproven group of cornerbacks.

          <p>Freddie Freeman delivered a clutch two-out, two-run single in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Los Angeles Dodgers a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Minnesota Twins. The dramatic hit saved the team from another painful bullpen collapse, which had wasted a stellar seven-inning, 12-strikeout performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. The win provided a much-needed boost for the Dodgers, but the article notes it does little to solve the team's ongoing concerns about its bullpen's recent struggles and heavy workload this season.</p>
