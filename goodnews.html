        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing increasing regulatory and trade pressures in the U.S., Temu and Shein are strategically pivoting to Europe and the UK as key growth markets, increasing advertising spending and expanding warehouse capacity. However, these platforms are encountering similar regulatory scrutiny in Europe, including a proposed customs fee and investigations into deceptive business practices. A French bill targeting ultra-cheap platforms like Shein and Temu seeks to penalize fast-fashion products for their environmental impact. Consumer spending data indicates a slowdown in U.S. growth for Temu and Shein, with some customers shifting to traditional retailers, while growth is observed in the UK and EU, particularly in France. The challenges in Europe include stricter regulations on product safety and consumer protection, requiring significant investments in compliance and operational transparency. Optimism is somewhat tempered by the regulatory hurdles facing the companies.</p>

          <p>China's policy of non-interference is being tested by its relationship with Niger's military government, which initially received substantial financial support from Beijing. However, relations have soured following disputes over salary disparities between expatriate and local workers in Chinese oil companies. Niger has ordered China National Petroleum Corporation to terminate contracts of expatriate employees with over four years of service, highlighting the challenges of Beijing's regime-agnostic approach. Experts suggest that China's non-interference policy, while intended to avoid entanglement, can incur economic costs as nationalism rises in some nations, as China tends to invest heavily in the economic priorities of ruling regimes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership positions. The report acknowledges insufficient efforts to close gender gaps by 2030, referencing Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership roles to about 30% by 2020, the target has been delayed, as the proportion remains low. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring more opportunities for women in decision-making, focusing on local economies and small businesses to combat female brain drain in rural areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to Southeast Asian industrial centers have increased significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit percentage growth compared to the same period in 2024. This shift is attributed to Chinese manufacturers rerouting exports through Southeast Asia to circumvent U.S. tariffs, with factories in these countries adding local content to qualify for re-export. Analysts note that this diversification of exports reflects closer economic and investment ties between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <h2>UN Report Highlights 'Unprecedented Decline' in World Fertility Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) highlights an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have the number of children they desire. The report cites financial limitations, lack of time, and absence of a suitable partner as key reasons for the decline. A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries found that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UNFPA urges caution in responding to low fertility, warning against panicky policies and emphasizing the need to avoid nationalist, anti-migrant, and gender conservative policies.</p>
