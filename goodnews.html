        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that music therapy is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. The therapy involves a combination of talk, music, and lyrical composition, allowing patients to express emotions and process their experiences with the guidance of trained therapists. As cancer survival rates improve, there is a growing need for varied therapies to enhance the quality of life for survivors. The study's author, Dr. Kevin Liou, highlights the importance of personalizing treatments and exploring the characteristics of patients who would most benefit from music therapy.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for treating Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger, offering hope for patients and insights into the biology of extreme appetite. However, this breakthrough comes amid concerns about cuts to federal funding for health research, which could disrupt efforts to understand and treat obesity's many causes and pathways. While the new medication is a positive development, the high cost and potential side effects remain challenges. Researchers hope that the knowledge gained from studying rare genetic obesity can inform the development of treatments for more common forms of the condition.</p>

          <p>The documentary "Sabbath Queen" follows Amichai Lau-Lavie, the first openly queer rabbi in a long Orthodox rabbinic lineage, in his identity quest and calls for peace. Lau-Lavie uses his platform to challenge homophobia, racism, and misogyny within Judaism, while also honoring his family's religious legacy. The film explores his various roles as a spiritual leader, including his drag persona Rebbetzin Hadassah Gross, and his efforts to promote inclusivity and pluralism. Lau-Lavie is critical of the Israeli government's reaction to the October 7 attacks and advocates for compassion towards both Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
