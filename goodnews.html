          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, has risen to its highest level since October 2023, increasing by 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% from March, far exceeding typical monthly increases. This surge is attributed to consumers anticipating price hikes due to new auto tariffs, even though these tariffs don't directly affect used car sales. Retail prices have followed, with the average used vehicle listing exceeding $25,000, while new vehicles approach $48,000. The article notes that used car prices are stabilizing but remain high compared to pre-pandemic levels. (not investment advice)</p>
