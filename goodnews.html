        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was told to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted inconsistencies in airline policies. While the TSA permits these products in carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines set their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches, yet other airlines' rules are less clear, leading to confusion and debate among travelers. The ambiguity exists despite some in-flight magazines even featuring advertisements for such products.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a widely criticized cruiserweight bout. Chavez Jr. appeared passive for most of the fight, throwing few punches and drawing boos from the crowd and visible frustration from his father at ringside. Paul controlled the contest and, despite the lackluster opposition, has now won 12 professional fights. The victory continues to fuel debate about the legitimacy of Paul's boxing career and the quality of his opponents.</p>

          <p>France is leading a significant investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The French state is now the largest shareholder, viewing the company as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing its much smaller satellite constellation and more limited launch capabilities. While Eutelsat may succeed in government and enterprise sectors, catching up in the mass-market broadband space remains a formidable challenge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a group of islands administered by Taipei but located just kilometers from the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. An on-the-ground analysis reveals the limitations of both Beijing's and Taipei's ability to fully influence the island's identity and future. The island exists as a modern oddity, a symbol of a past conflict that highlights the complex and often contradictory dynamics of the present.</p>

The events come as some corporations have reduced their sponsorship of Pride, adding another challenge for organizers.
