          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, explains that Juneteenth, celebrated on June 19, 1865, marks the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned of their freedom. This day followed multiple African American liberation movements and allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and identities as both African and American. By the 1870s, Baltimore City held a parade in honor of the holiday, reflecting the city's large free pre-Civil War population and its role in the Underground Railroad. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, suggesting visits to museums to understand the lived experiences of freedom. Learning about the history behind Juneteenth helps us understand collective ancestry and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>A gay anti-bullying PSA from 2008, featuring Hilary Duff, has become a cult classic for a generation that saw the advertisement on TV, shaping public discourse against using the phrase "that's so gay." The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign, spearheaded by GLSEN, aimed to combat anti-LGBTQ+ language and featured similar spots with celebrities like Wanda Sykes. Data shows that the ads made inroads on curbing the term's use, with GLSEN's 2021 school climate survey finding a decrease in the frequency of hearing "that's so gay." The ad has been referenced in media and culture, with recreations appearing across platforms like TikTok and Instagram, demonstrating its lasting impact.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling shares of CrowdStrike and Eaton to capitalize on recent market strength and lock in significant gains. The decision to trim the CrowdStrike position does not reflect a change in the long-term thesis for the cybersecurity company. Despite a ceasefire in the Middle East, the cyber threat environment remains elevated, making cybersecurity investments crucial. The Eaton sale is motivated by concerns that the magnitude of earnings beats has shrunk, potentially making it tougher for the stock to perform as well as it did in 2024. The club would also sell some shares of Broadcom if it were not restricted from trading it. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite pressure from President Trump to cut rates, Powell emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. While the labor market shows signs of slowing, Powell believes it is premature to lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. He stated that the Fed is prepared to wait and gather more economic data before making any adjustments to its policy stance. Two Fed officials have recently suggested considering a rate cut at the next meeting, but Powell's testimony indicates a more cautious approach. (not investment advice)</p>

Higher mortgage rates are keeping potential monthly payments high, pricing out many buyers, particularly first-timers. The supply of homes for sale is rising, but remains below pre-pandemic levels, preventing major price declines.

The share of Americans describing themselves as not financially secure has increased, reaching 77% this year. Gen Xers were the most likely to say they are not where they want to be financially, and women feel less confident about their financial position than men.

Experts say that cuts to domestic health institutions and foreign aid are likely to jeopardize efforts to end the HIV epidemic in the US by 2030. Lenacapavir, described as a "miracle" drug by UNAIDS, provides six months of protection against HIV infection. Concerns are growing about whether the defunding of US public health agencies will hinder the delivery of lenacapavir to those who need it most. The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has affected key public health agencies and programs, potentially impacting vulnerable groups' access to the new PrEP drug.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic examines the evolution of design from a focus on aesthetics and utility to a broader role in addressing societal issues, highlighting the ambitions and limitations of "design thinking." The article traces the history of design, from the Bauhaus movement to the rise of user research in the tech industry. It explores how design thinking, popularized by firms like Ideo, has been applied to a wide range of problems, including "wicked problems" like poverty and inequality. The author questions whether design has become a distraction from the real work of achieving political consensus and government action. The article suggests that while design can contribute to positive social change, it cannot solve societal problems alone.</p>

          <p>Quebec provides universal childcare for less than $7 a day, a model that has been successful in offering high-quality early education, supporting families, and boosting the government's tax revenue. The program, inspired by US research, has led to high female labor force participation rates, a smaller gender pay gap, and reduced child poverty. Experts suggest that the US can learn from Quebec's approach, which involves public investment, universal access, and high parental involvement. While challenges remain, such as ensuring equal access and addressing staff shortages, Quebec's model demonstrates the potential for a publicly supported childcare system to benefit families and the economy.</p>
