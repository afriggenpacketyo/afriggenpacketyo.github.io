          <p>After more than a century, Parisians are once again legally swimming in the Seine River, celebrating the culmination of a $1.5 billion cleanup project. The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to severe pollution, was lifted after water quality was deemed safe on most days, a legacy of efforts tied to the previous year's Olympics. Mayor Anne Hidalgo joined enthusiastic residents at designated swimming zones near the Eiffel Tower, marking a historic moment for the city. While some remain skeptical, the opening provides a refreshing urban oasis amid rising European temperatures.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab, marine scientists are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and improve the public's view of the often-feared creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team conducts research by temporarily capturing sharks, examining their stomach contents to assess their diet and the bay's water quality, and then releasing them. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem. Despite public fascination, securing financial support for this vital research remains a significant challenge for the scientists.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:50:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Arizona man is raising awareness about illegal rental agreement clauses after he was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews. Adrian Paull and his wife left reviews detailing issues like black mold in their condo, which violated a 'non-disparagement' clause in their lease that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. This practice is illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' right to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause, but the case highlights a broader issue of businesses attempting to silence customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a '90-second rule' as a technique for managing negative emotions like anger and stress to live a more fulfilled life. The concept is based on neuroscientific findings that the physiological stress response, involving hormones like cortisol, lasts for only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any prolonged feeling of upset is due to consciously or unconsciously re-running the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself to feel the emotion for that minute and a half, and then making a conscious choice to move on, thereby preventing rumination and taking control of one's emotional state.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish culture of prioritizing hobbies, a business school professor embarked on a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from woodworking to pickleball. The author, Marina Cooley, found that dedicating time to hobbies fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and redefine her concept of self-care. She argues that hobbies are not a reward for achieving work-life balance, but rather the secret to creating it in the first place. The experience fostered deeper connections with others and provided a powerful model of personal fulfillment for her children.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate from heart attacks in the United States has seen a remarkable decline, falling by nearly 90 percent between 1970 and 2022. This significant public health achievement is attributed to a combination of factors, including successful anti-smoking campaigns, the widespread use of statin drugs to manage cholesterol, and major advancements in emergency medical care. While heart disease remains a leading cause of death, the shift has been from acute, fatal heart attacks to more chronic conditions. Further progress is possible through broader adoption of new medications and advanced screening methods.</p>

A JL Partners survey found that 19% of U.S. voters, and over a third of those aged 19-29, would favor replacing the U.S. President with the British monarch. The article connects this sentiment to the enduring influence and 'brand power' of the British royal family, highlighted by the recent announcement that the Prince and Princess of Wales will begin granting Royal Warrants.

          <p>The Apple TV+ series 'Murderbot,' based on Martha Wells' novella, offers a unique take on artificial intelligence by featuring a protagonist that couldn't care less about humanity. The show follows a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas. Unlike many sci-fi narratives where AI seeks to understand or emulate human experience, Murderbot finds humans to be messy and uninteresting, preferring to be treated as a machine. This quirky premise subverts typical AI tropes and explores the potential for a machine consciousness that has no desire to connect with its creators.</p>
