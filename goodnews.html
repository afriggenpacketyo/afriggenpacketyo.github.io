        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to mandate that American medical schools offer nutrition courses or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy believes aspiring physicians are taught how to treat illnesses with drugs but not how to keep people healthy with food. A 2015 study found that medical students spend an average of only 19 hours on required nutrition education over four years. The proposal has garnered mixed reactions, with some medical schools claiming they already offer sufficient nutrition education, while nutrition experts see the mandate as long overdue.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to President Trump's efforts to neutralize federal agencies that protect civil servants. The court argues that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the special counsel are unable to fulfill their roles due to Trump's actions, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected by laws that are still in effect. The article discusses the legal theory of the "unitary executive" and its implications for the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>An AI program trained on radiocarbon dating suggests some Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than previously thought, potentially reshaping our understanding of Judaism and early Christianity. The new method combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately estimate an ancient text's age. Researchers trained an AI model on 24 manuscripts with reliable radiocarbon dating and then used it to analyze the handwriting style of 135 scrolls with unknown dates. The AI analysis found the manuscripts are older than previous estimates overall, suggesting dates in the early second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier.</p>
