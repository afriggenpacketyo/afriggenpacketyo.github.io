        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor has suspended its 2025 financial guidance, citing an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Trump's tariffs, primarily due to tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The company anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions and volume/pricing adjustments, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion. Ford also cited potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and retaliatory tariffs as reasons for the decision. While Ford has not announced significant changes to its North American manufacturing plans, the company has already taken steps to mitigate tariff costs, such as ceasing U.S. exports to China. Without the tariffs, Ford was tracking toward its initial guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors is engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as a prominent American luxury brand, focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade.

The strategy involves differentiating Cadillac's products from other GM brands, emphasizing unique interiors and engines. Despite challenges in China and with EV production, Cadillac is largely adhering to the plan established a decade ago, with a focus on value over volume and the upcoming relaunch of the bespoke Celestiq.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing its controlling nonprofit to maintain its grip on the company. This decision follows criticism from figures like Elon Musk, who argued OpenAI was too focused on profits and straying from its safety-first mission. The move comes amid corporate drama for the influential AI company, whose ChatGPT release in 2022 sparked a tech industry scramble. While the new structure allows the nonprofit to be OpenAI‚Äôs largest shareholder, the details of the nonprofit's stake are still under negotiation. Sam Altman, OpenAI's chief executive, stated that this sets them up to have a more understandable structure.</p>

          <p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has announced that he will not seek the GOP nomination in next year's Georgia Senate race, a key contest for control of Congress' upper chamber. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family, and he has committed to working alongside Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee. The Georgia Senate race is closely watched, and retaining the seat is essential to Democrats' efforts to regain control of the Senate.

          <p>President Trump has falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, citing $1.98, while the national average is over $3. According to AAA, the national average is $3.165 per gallon. Trump's claim appears to be referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon but doesn't reflect retail prices. Experts emphasize that RBOB excludes taxes, tariffs, transportation, and other costs, making it irrelevant to consumers. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said only analysts, wholesalers and fuel buyers at large store chains care about RBOB.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell about 2% to close at the lowest in four years after OPEC+ agreed to hike production for a second month. U.S. crude lost $1.16, or 2%, to close at $57.13 a barrel, the lowest settlement since February 2021. The eight producers in the group, led by Saudi Arabia, agreed to increase output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June. Oil prices in April posted the biggest monthly loss since 2021, as U.S. President Trump's higher tariffs have raised fears of a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
