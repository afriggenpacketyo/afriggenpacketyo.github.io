          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 20:37:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SpaceX launched its Starship spacecraft on its ninth test flight, successfully reaching orbit before encountering issues that led to an uncontrolled reentry. A suspected propellant leak caused the spacecraft to spin, resulting in a loss of attitude control. Despite the initial success of achieving a suborbital trajectory, the inability to control the vehicle during reentry meant it was expected to burn up due to an unideal angle for the heat shield. This test flight is a crucial step in Elon Musk's ambition to send humans to Mars, and SpaceX must demonstrate Starship's safe and reliable flight capabilities before astronauts can embark on such missions.</p>

          <p>The WNBA investigated claims of racist fan behavior during a game between the Chicago Sky and Indiana Fever but was unable to substantiate the allegations. The investigation included gathering information from fans, team and arena staff, and reviewing audio and video from the game. The claims centered around alleged racist comments directed towards Chicago's Angel Reese during the game against Caitlin Clark and the Fever. Both teams and the WNBA Players Association supported the investigation, but the league found no evidence to support the claims.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Detroit to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in Minneapolis due to a sick dog on board.

Medical personnel met the dog and its owner upon arrival in Minneapolis, and the plane later resumed its journey to Los Angeles without further incident.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly integrating humanoid robots into real-world sports competitions, such as kickboxing contests and marathons, to expose them to unpredictable environments and gather valuable data for their development. These competitions allow robots to perform actions like running and punching, helping engineers refine their movements and responses. Analysts suggest that this focus on real-world data is crucial for improving the "brains" of humanoid robots, enabling them to achieve greater consistency and accuracy in physical tasks. This effort is part of an intensifying tech rivalry between China and the United States, with companies racing to commercialize humanoid robot technology.</p>

          <p>U.S. airlines are generating significant revenue from checked bag fees, bringing in over $7 billion last year, according to data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. This revenue has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driven by airlines adjusting their policies to address rising operational costs. Southwest Airlines recently announced it will start charging for the first checked bag, while JetBlue has implemented surge pricing for bag-check fees during peak travel periods. American, Delta, and United each made over $1 billion on checked bags last year, highlighting the importance of these fees to their overall financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>
