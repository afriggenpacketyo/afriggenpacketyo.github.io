          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating a list of 11 potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, with his term ending in May. The list includes previously unmentioned names such as Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside figures like Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman and former St. Louis Fed President James Bullard. According to sources, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will conduct interviews to narrow down the choices for the president's final decision. The extensive list and deliberative process suggest a decision is not imminent, potentially avoiding market disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates has triggered a significant 23% weekly increase in refinancing applications, marking the strongest week for the activity since last April. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.67%, prompting many homeowners to seek savings. Notably, there was also a 25% jump in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which carry more risk but currently offer lower initial rates. Despite the refinancing boom, applications for new home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase, indicating high home prices remain a barrier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sig Hansen, the 59-year-old captain from the reality TV show "Deadliest Catch," has opened up about how several life-threatening health scares at sea have altered his perspective on life, family, and his dangerous career. Hansen told Fox News Digital that surviving a heart attack and a severe infection has made him more fearful of the risks of fishing and more appreciative of his time with family. He recounted a particularly close call with an infection that could have been fatal had he been at sea. While not ready to retire, the veteran fisherman says his priorities have shifted towards spending more time with his wife and grandchildren.</p>

          <p>Scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China have constructed the world's largest array of neutral atoms for quantum computing, a significant advance in the field. Their system uses an AI-powered process with optical tweezers to arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, which serve as qubits, into precise patterns with remarkable speed. This achievement overcomes a major scalability hurdle for atom-based quantum computers, which are considered a promising approach due to the stability and control offered by neutral atoms. The work was praised by peer reviewers as a major leap forward for experimental feasibility in quantum physics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a panel discussion, entrepreneurs emphasized the critical balance between creative passion and the analytical mindset required to run a successful business, especially when starting with limited funds. They noted that while it is important to create beautiful products that bring personal joy, it is essential to also produce items that are commercially viable to pay the bills. One key strategy discussed was avoiding a narrowly defined customer profile to maintain broad appeal. The panelists also highlighted the power of authenticity on social media, suggesting that showing the real, sometimes messy, behind-the-scenes reality of a small business builds a stronger connection with customers than a polished corporate image.</p>

          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," uses the mysterious disappearance of 17 children to explore societal prejudices against unmarried women. The movie centers on Justine (Julia Garner), a single schoolteacher who becomes the prime suspect and is branded a witch by her community, which struggles to comprehend the unexplainable event. The article analyzes how the film taps into a long-standing trope in horror and pop culture where single women are depicted as unstable threats to the social order. Despite the harassment she faces, Justine emerges as the film's resilient heroine, determined to uncover the truth while navigating a world that vilifies her independence.</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome browser, following a landmark antitrust ruling that could force Google to sell the asset. A U.S. judge found that Google illegally monopolized the search market, and the Department of Justice is proposing the divestiture of Chrome as a remedy. Chrome is central to Google's advertising business, which generated over $230 billion in 2023, as it allows for extensive data collection. While other companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have expressed interest, Perplexity's unsolicited bid is the first formal offer, signaling a potential major shakeup in the tech landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient whale, named Janjucetus dullardi, that lived 26 million years ago. The discovery was made after a well-preserved fossilized skull was found on Victoria's Surf Coast by a local resident, for whom the species is named. Researchers describe the creature as a dolphin-sized predator with sharp, slicing teeth, calling it the "shark-like version of a baleen whale." This finding adds to the understanding of early whale evolution, as the region is a renowned site for unearthing rare fossils from the Oligocene epoch, offering new insights into how these marine mammals adapted.</p>

          <p>The reboot of the animated series "King of the Hill" returns to a suburban Texas that feels increasingly like a fantasy in today's socially fragmented America. The show's focus on close-knit neighborly relationships and mutual support offers a comforting, idealistic vision of community that seems difficult to achieve in reality. The article suggests that by choosing to stay in their neighborhood and help their struggling friend Bill, the Hill family reaffirms the show's core message about the value of commitment to one's community. While the revival largely avoids contemporary political divisions, it champions a form of social cohesion and tolerance that feels both nostalgic and aspirational.</p>

          <p>Sophie Elmhirst's new book, "A Marriage at Sea," tells the incredible story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who survived for nearly four months adrift in the Pacific Ocean after a whale sank their sailboat in 1972. The couple endured starvation and illness in a tiny inflatable raft, their survival hinging on their resourcefulness and, crucially, their support for one another. The article explores how their shared ordeal, and their constant planning for a future sailing trip, became a form of "shared meaning" that strengthened their bond. Their story offers a profound, if extreme, example of how a shared purpose can help a relationship endure unimaginable hardship.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 06:48:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the September 2022 mini-budget, the average interest rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%. Financial data provider Moneyfacts described the drop below the 5% threshold as a "symbolic turning point" that indicates increased competition among lenders. This provides some relief for the 1.6 million borrowers whose fixed-rate deals are set to expire this year. However, with inflation forecast to spike again, analysts suggest that while rates are responding to Bank of England cuts, they are unlikely to fall substantially further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued interim guidance encouraging police forces to consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. The move aims to combat misinformation and is a response to public pressure and accusations that authorities have withheld such details in sensitive cases, such as the alleged sexual assault of a child in Warwickshire. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the guidance as a step toward greater transparency. However, some critics, including a former police chief, warn of unintended consequences, such as creating an expectation for disclosure in every case.</p>
