          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing role as the backbone for institutional finance, shifting focus from price speculation to utility. Major financial players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are increasingly building on Ethereum and its Layer 2 networks for tokenized assets and funds. Despite market volatility, institutions are drawn to Ethereum's stability, security, and decade-long operational record without downtime. This trend suggests a significant shift towards integrating blockchain technology into core global financial systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. This project, combined with a similar one from May, forms the largest initiative of its kind and is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. The new station spans 60,000 square meters and leverages the ocean's surface to boost panel efficiency by 5 to 8 percent. This development represents a major breakthrough in renewable energy, significantly cutting carbon emissions while utilizing ocean space for power generation.</p>

          <p>Japan's national rugby team defeated Wales 24-19 in a grueling match played in extreme heat and humidity in Kitakyushu, extending Wales's record international losing streak to 18 games. Wales led 19-7 at halftime but struggled to cope with the intense conditions in the second half. Japan capitalized, with a late try from Halatoa Vailea sealing the win for the Eddie Jones-coached side. The victory marks Japan's second-ever win against Wales and drops the Welsh team to an all-time low of 14th in world rankings.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a difficult path in the Women's Euro 2025 tournament, having been drawn into the highly competitive Group D alongside France and the Netherlands. The group features three teams ranked in the world's top 11, with data analysis suggesting it is the toughest of the tournament. Defending champions England, 2017 winners Netherlands, and a strong French side all have impressive tournament records, creating a challenging scenario for all teams involved. Wales, competing in their first major tournament, are considered the underdogs but have shown they can compete against top-tier opposition.</p>

          <h2>New Studies on Visual Illusions Reignite Debate on Cultural Influences in Perception</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing debate over whether culture shapes how people see the world is explored through two recent studies with conflicting findings on visual illusions. One study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments perceive the Coffer illusion as rectangles, while those from rural Namibia see circles. However, another study convincingly argues that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent. The article posits that while perceptual diversity exists, it is complex, and we must look beyond simple cultural stereotypes to understand the interplay between our environment and our brains.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has reopened the Seine River to public swimming, a legacy project of the 2024 Olympics. Three designated and supervised swimming zones have been established, complete with changing rooms and showers, and will be free to the public until the end of August. The reopening follows a €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted since swimming was banned in 1923. The project is part of a broader city initiative to enhance quality of life and adapt to climate change.</p>

          <p>Scotland's rugby team began their summer tour in New Zealand with a hard-fought 29-26 victory against the Maori All Blacks in Whangarei. Despite the hosts dominating possession, Scotland's clinical attack gave them a lead which they narrowly defended in the final moments. Both teams scored four tries, but a crucial first-half penalty by Adam Hastings made the difference for the tourists. The predominantly second-string Scottish side had to produce a massive defensive effort in the final minutes, holding out against a relentless Maori attack to secure a memorable win.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China have made a potential breakthrough in regenerative medicine by discovering a "genetic switch" that restored damaged ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal Science, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate is linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in development. By reactivating a specific genetic pathway, the team achieved complete restoration of lost cartilage and tissue in the mice's ears. This discovery suggests a similar mechanism might exist in other organs and offers hope for future human applications.</p>
