        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases in April due to a cyber attack. Shoppers can now buy fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow. The return of online shopping is a milestone for the retailer, which has struggled to recover since the attack, impacting stock levels and deliveries. The cyber attack is estimated to cost M&S around ¬£300 million in profits this year, and some personal customer data was stolen, though payment details and passwords remain secure. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic as the retailer works to restore normal services.</p>

          <p>Gen Z is showing a resurgence in religious engagement, reversing recent trends of declining church attendance. Experts are exploring reasons behind this shift, including rebellion against atheist parents and gender dynamics. While women have historically been more religious, Catholicism is experiencing a rise in young men, possibly influenced by politics. Some young people are returning to religion for a sense of community and answers to life's challenges. The phenomenon reflects a complex interplay of social, cultural, and personal factors.</p>

          <p>TalkTV host David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after a disagreement over a burka ban. Bull, a long-time ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on inspiring the party's base and providing leadership to volunteers. Yusuf will now lead the party's "Doge team," aiming to cut wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. Farage credited Yusuf with building Reform's infrastructure and stated that the party is stronger following the reshuffle. The changes indicate a shift in leadership and strategy within the party.</p>

          <p>Despite a relatively quiet offseason, the San Diego Padres are performing well in the competitive National League West, sitting nine games over .500 and two games out of first place. The team has relied on internal talent and strategic acquisitions to remain competitive, despite the Dodgers' high-profile signings. Pitcher Joe Musgrove emphasized the team's confidence in their staff and management's ability to make necessary adjustments throughout the season.

          <p>Missouri GOP Senator Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning with some of the most liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would increase the federal standard starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation in subsequent years, with Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch as a co-sponsor. The move puts Hawley at odds with traditional conservative party orthodoxy but reflects a shift towards populism and working-class voters. Hawley has also teamed up with Senator Bernie Sanders on other economic proposals, indicating a willingness to cross party lines on certain issues.

          <p>An analysis of McLaren's Formula 1 strategy addresses whether the team should prioritize one driver, Lando Norris or Oscar Piastri, for the title. Despite historical examples of teams benefiting from favoring a single driver, McLaren's philosophy is to allow free competition between their drivers. Norris and Piastri have contracts guaranteeing equal treatment, and the team emphasizes open communication to manage potential clashes. While acknowledging the threat posed by Max Verstappen, McLaren believes their approach provides the best chance for both drivers to achieve their personal goals while also securing the constructors' championship.

          <p>Scientists are helping Yosemite's native turtles recover by removing invasive bullfrogs from remote ponds and lakes. The American bullfrog, introduced in the late 1800s, has decimated local wildlife, including the Northwestern pond turtle. Researchers conducted night and day surveys to remove nearly 16,000 bullfrogs, leading to the reappearance of young turtles and a more balanced food web. The study offers a potential tool for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems, though it requires near-constant vigilance and strategic management. The situation has improved in Yosemite.</p>
