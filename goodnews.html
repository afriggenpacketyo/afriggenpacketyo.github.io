He assured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and that DOGE is helping to improve the agency, despite potential reservations.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, citing the administration's "Student Criminal Alien Initiative." The judge found that the students were likely to succeed in challenging the terminations, as they did not pose an immediate threat to safety or national security. The nationwide injunction prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the students and bars the administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain students' legal status. The judge criticized the Trump administration for abruptly changing course to satisfy courts' concerns and warned against skirting mandatory regulations.</p>
