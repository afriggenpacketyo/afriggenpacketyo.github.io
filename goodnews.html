        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Americans face mounting credit card debt due to high APRs, record balances, and rising inflation, making payments difficult. Ignoring the issue can lead to late fees and credit score damage, but several options exist. Consumers should first contact their credit card companies to explore hardship programs like reduced payments or lower interest rates. Other viable strategies include credit counseling for budgeting and negotiation, balance transfers to 0% APR cards for temporary relief, or debt consolidation loans to combine multiple balances into a single, lower-interest payment. Taking prompt action is crucial to avoid severe financial consequences and achieve stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Spanish Civil Guard successfully dismantled an illegal animal trafficking operation, seizing over 150 exotic animals, including several endangered species, from an unauthorized pet store in Nules, Valencia. Two men, aged 30 and 35, were arrested and are being prosecuted for trafficking protected species and smuggling, having conducted sales online without the necessary permits. The investigation was initiated months prior after officers discovered online listings and videos featuring various exotic animals, including leopards, owls, and llamas. Among the seized creatures were critically endangered species such as ring-tailed lemurs, Bali starlings, and Asian otters, with an estimated market value of nearly $81,500. Additionally, three macaws were found, two of which had been reported stolen.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The future trajectory of gold prices in September is uncertain, influenced by inflation trends and potential Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. Gold prices have surged significantly in 2024 but recently dipped from a record high. A decline in August inflation could lead to lower gold prices due to a reduced need for alternative assets, while an anticipated Fed rate cut in September might cause prices to rise, as historically lower rates increase gold demand. Investors seeking inflation hedges or portfolio diversification are advised to consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging or fractional investments, as gold's long-term trend remains upward despite short-term fluctuations.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $815 million for Wednesday night's drawing, making it the seventh largest prize in the game's history, after no winning tickets matched all numbers for Monday's $750 million grand prize. The substantial jackpot, which has an estimated cash value of $367.9 million before taxes, offers a winner the choice of a single lump sum payment or an annuity comprising one immediate payment followed by 29 annually increasing installments. This marks the 38th drawing without a grand prize winner since May 31, fueling public excitement and ticket sales despite the daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million. Drawings occur three times a week across 45 states.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump publicly weighed in on the controversy surrounding the company's new logo. Trump suggested the company revert to its old logo, viewing the public outrage as a "great opportunity" for free publicity if handled correctly. His comments, made on Truth Social, spurred a more than 5% gain in Cracker Barrel shares within 30 minutes. This intervention followed criticism from his son and other conservatives regarding the rebranding, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, the IPO market shows strong signs of rebound, with Swedish lender Klarna eyeing a $13-14 billion valuation for its September IPO, a positive indicator for investment banking divisions at firms like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. This resurgence in dealmaking, with 139 IPOs year-to-date, signifies a much improved year for new listings. (not investment advice)</p>

He dismissed the criticism as "insulting," linking the policy to his positive relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping and a broader strategy of engagement. Trump emphasized that robust security screenings are conducted and highlighted Secretary of State Marco Rubio's support for appropriate oversight, portraying the policy as mutually beneficial for both nations and vital for American higher education.</p>

Armenta's debut album "Portate Bien" blends corridos tumbados with reggaeton and pop, focusing on themes of love and heartache. Kane Rodriguez's "La Batuta" sticks to traditional corrido sounds with raw vocals and prickly guitar. Clave Especial's "Mija No Te Asustes" transforms their banda sound into a boisterous affair.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with $100,000 to save, comparing Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts is crucial for maximizing interest earnings while protecting principal. CDs offer fixed interest rates for a set term, providing predictable returns, whereas high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that can fluctuate. Analysis shows that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, though CD earnings are guaranteed, unlike the variable rates of high-yield accounts. Savers must weigh the predictability of CDs against the potential for higher, but uncertain, returns from high-yield accounts, and consider early withdrawal penalties for CDs.

          <p>An Italian master painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, stolen by Nazis from Jewish art dealer Jacques Goudstikker 80 years ago, has been located in an estate agent advertisement for a house in Argentina. The artwork, listed on a database of lost wartime art, was spotted in a property once owned by Friedrich Kadgien, a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after World War II. Goudstikker's daughter-in-law, Marei von Saher, who recovered 202 pieces of his collection in 2006, is now seeking to reclaim this missing painting. The discovery offers a rare glimpse into the enduring legacy of Nazi art theft and ongoing efforts for restitution.</p>

Investors are advised to diversify beyond the S&P 500 into smaller stocks, other sectors like business services and healthcare, and international markets.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced a historic achievement, seizing over 76,000 pounds of illegal drugs—approximately 61,740 pounds of cocaine and 14,400 pounds of marijuana—off the Florida coast. This marks the largest drug offload in the agency's 110-year history, with an estimated street value of $473 million. Rear Admiral Adam Chamie highlighted the immense threat posed by transnational drug trafficking, noting the seized cocaine alone represents 23 million lethal doses. The seizures resulted from 19 interdictions in international waters between June and August, involving multiple U.S. and Dutch naval assets. The Coast Guard is intensifying its counter-drug operations to protect the nation from illicit trafficking.</p>
