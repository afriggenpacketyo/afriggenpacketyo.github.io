          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge's ruling favored the game maker, allowing link-outs without Apple's commission. Fortnite was previously removed from iPhones and iPads in 2020 for circumventing Apple's commission fees. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's return, though Apple retains the right to reject the submission. The article details that this development follows Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's App Store policies, highlighting the ongoing legal battle between the two companies.</p>
