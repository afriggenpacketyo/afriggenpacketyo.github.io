          <h2>Expert Debunks Common Myths About Cooking Oils and Healthy Fats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 19:06:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Cambridge professor debunks common myths about cooking oils, emphasizing that no single oil is a magic key to health. The article clarifies that sunflower and vegetable oils are good for us, being low in saturated fats and high in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, and are also budget-friendly. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, having near-zero trans fats and capable of reducing bad cholesterol. Furthermore, while extra virgin olive oil is best for dressings due to its low smoke point, basic olive oil is suitable for shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for deep frying due to higher heat tolerance.</p>

          <p>Cool Patch Pumpkins in northern California, home to a sprawling 40-acre corn maze, invites visitors to embrace the unique fun of getting lost. Owner Taylor Cooley emphasizes the excitement of navigating the intricate pathways, which has twice earned a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest. The maze, featuring elaborate designs like this year's tribute to farmers and five elevated bridges, typically takes at least 45 minutes to complete. Beyond the main attraction, the pumpkin patch also offers a corn bath for toddlers, providing a distinctive and engaging fall experience for families.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is actively encouraging captain Martin Odegaard to continue embracing creative risks on the field, asserting that this approach is fundamental to his "phenomenal" nature. Odegaard's recent display in the Champions League win against Olympiacos, where he contributed to both goals, clearly showcased his crucial role and increasing influence for the Gunners. Arteta has granted the 26-year-old "total freedom" to explore and generate spaces, especially as he fully recovers from a shoulder injury that disrupted his season start. The article underscores Odegaard's growing impact, including a decisive stoppage-time corner that secured a comeback victory against Newcastle.</p>

          <p>Manchester City twice squandered a lead, ultimately drawing 2-2 against Monaco in the Champions League after conceding a 90th-minute penalty. Star striker Erling Haaland, who scored both of City's goals, was highly critical of the team's performance, stating they "don't deserve to win" and lacked sufficient energy in the second half. This result continues a worrying trend for City, who have conceded late goals in several recent matches, costing them crucial points in both the Premier League and Champions League. Despite being unbeaten in their last six games, the team's struggles with late concessions and poor away form in European competition are becoming a significant concern for manager Pep Guardiola.</p>

          <p>A new In-N-Out restaurant's grand opening in Monrovia, Southern California, took an unexpected turn when an employee discovered a 3- to 4-foot-long python in the drive-thru lane. The Pasadena Humane organization responded to the unusual "animal-style problem," safely wrangling the snake, which was noted to be "well taken care of." The python is currently classified as a stray and is not available for adoption, with authorities actively seeking any information about its owner.

          <h2>Stock Markets Remain Resilient Amid Government Shutdown, History Suggests Modest Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, with investors appearing largely unfazed. Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 indicates a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, particularly if the closure is brief. The S&P 500, for instance, averaged a 0.3% gain during past closures and a significant 13% jump in the 12 months following. However, experts caution that this current situation could differ due to unique political dynamics, warning that a prolonged shutdown could fuel market uncertainty, halt crucial economic reports, and negatively impact investment and hiring decisions.

          <h2>Pope Leo XIV Challenges "Pro-Life" Stance on Abortion and Death Penalty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 18:11:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pope Leo XIV, in his first direct comments on U.S. politics, criticized those who oppose abortion but simultaneously support the death penalty, asserting that such a stance is "not really pro-life." He further questioned the "pro-life" label for individuals advocating for inhumane treatment of immigrants. His remarks, echoing common Catholic arguments, arose amidst a controversy concerning Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich's plan to honor Senator Dick Durbin, who supports abortion rights. The Pope called for greater mutual respect and a comprehensive examination of all ethical issues within the Church's teachings, which unequivocally oppose both abortion and capital punishment while advocating for humane treatment of migrants.</p>

          <p>The prospect of US-Russia cooperation in the Arctic is emerging, potentially challenging China's growing influence and ambitions in the polar region. Russian President Putin and former US President Trump have both hinted at possibilities for collaboration, specifically in areas like energy, shipping routes, and infrastructure development. Experts suggest that both sides recognize their common interests in the Arctic, viewing it as a potential avenue to normalize US-Russia relations and for Russia to strategically offset its increasing dependence on China. Such renewed cooperation between Washington and Moscow could significantly overlap with and impact existing China-Russia Arctic initiatives, creating a complex and evolving geopolitical dynamic in the thawing polar region.</p>

Dane, who publicly announced his diagnosis in April, recently met with U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell to emphasize the legislation's critical importance in funding research and providing early access to treatments. His personal fight has profoundly shifted from initial anger to a fierce determination to live for his young daughters, despite a noticeable slur in his speech.

          <p>As Saturday Night Live enters its 51st season, the show is subtly shifting its casting strategy, increasingly recruiting comedians who have built their reputations on online platforms rather than traditional improv and sketch stages. While many veterans like Bowen Yang and Kenan Thompson remain, new additions such as Jane Wickline, Jeremy Culhane, and Veronika Slowikowska have found their footing on TikTok, podcasts, and streaming services. This move represents a deliberate nudge towards an internet-savvy cast, reflecting the changing landscape of comedy production. The article notes the controversial inclusion of Kam Patterson, known for his right-wing aligned online presence, signaling a potential departure from past casting cautiousness following a similar incident in 2019.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The President and the Dragon," chronicles former President Jimmy Carter's heroic post-presidency mission to eradicate Guinea worm disease, a debilitating parasite spread through contaminated water. Inspired by its devastating effects, Carter made its elimination his life's work, successfully reducing global cases from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986 to a mere 14 by the time of his death in 2024. The film emphasizes that this near-eradication was achieved through education and clean water initiatives, not vaccines, and highlights the crucial role of on-the-ground volunteers and local doctors. The article's director, Waleed Eltayeb, underscores the powerful message of hope and collective human achievement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, primarily driven by record electric vehicle (EV) sales. Both GM and Ford saw their overall sales increase by approximately 8% year-over-year, with EV sales more than doubling for GM and increasing 30% for Ford. This significant surge in EV purchases is largely attributed to consumers pulling forward their plans to buy new zero-emissions vehicles ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal incentives. Automakers are now implementing their own incentives, like Hyundai's price reductions and cash offers, to maintain sales momentum, acknowledging a potential temporary dip in EV market share following the end of the federal program.
