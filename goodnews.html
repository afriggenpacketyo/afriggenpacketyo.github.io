          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new wave of younger investors is significantly influencing the market by backing companies with bold, forward-thinking ideas rather than established giants. He argues these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood, for its use of blockchain, and Reddit, for its advertising potential, creating what he calls an "idea market." According to Cramer, this new generation is less focused on traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policies and more interested in the potential growth stories of individual companies, fundamentally shifting market dynamics away from institutional, index-based strategies.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to dismantle the broad U.S. sanctions program against Syria, a move aimed at supporting the country's path toward stability after the ousting of Bashar Assad. The action, which ends Syria's long-standing isolation from the international financial system, was welcomed by the new Syrian transitional government as a "major turning point." The order also directs the State Department to review the terrorist designations of the ruling Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group and its leader, while maintaining targeted sanctions on Assad and his associates for human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>GE Appliances is accelerating its plan to move manufacturing jobs back to the United States, announcing a $490 million investment to create 800 new jobs at a laundry care plant in Louisville, Kentucky. An executive stated that while the company has long planned to reshore production, the current environment of high tariffs on Chinese imports was a key factor in expediting the decision. The move aligns with the company's "zero distance" philosophy of building appliances where they are sold, which will cease its washer and dryer manufacturing in China once the new U.S. plant is operational.</p>

          <p>London's privy council, the highest court of appeal for the Cayman Islands, has upheld the British overseas territory's Civil Partnership Law. The court rejected a challenge that argued the governor had overstepped his authority by enacting the law after local lawmakers had voted it down. This ruling provides legal certainty for same-sex couples on the islands and is being hailed by activists as a landmark victory. Campaigners believe the decision could set a positive precedent for other British overseas territories where LGBTQ+ rights are still being contested in court.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again after a five-year ban. The resolution came after Emmett personally paid over $630,000 to settle a long-standing debt related to unpaid compensation and health benefits for four writers from a collapsed 2019 television project. Emmett stated he made the decision to pay the debt, which was originally tied to his defunct production firm, because it was "the right thing to do," clearing the way for his current company to proceed with new projects.</p>

The multibillion-dollar project, envisioned as an "Iron Dome for America," would utilize a sophisticated network of satellites and space-based sensors to intercept long-range missiles. While analysts believe the system could significantly bolster U.S. defensive capabilities and deter potential aggression, including in a conflict over Taiwan, major questions remain about its technological feasibility, immense cost, and the timeline for its potential deployment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears of renewed inflation, President Trump's widespread tariffs have not yet led to significant price spikes for U.S. consumers. Economists attribute this stability to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including aggressively pre-ordering inventory before the tariffs took effect, a practice known as front-loading. Additionally, some companies are temporarily absorbing the extra costs to avoid losing market share, while others are using logistical loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers and that price increases are likely in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
