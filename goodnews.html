          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the United Kingdom, signaling a significant step in U.S.-UK economic relations. The announcement, made in the Oval Office, highlights the administration's focus on reshaping international trade agreements. Separately, First Lady Melania Trump hosted a stamp unveiling for former First Lady Barbara Bush. On foreign policy, the administration is closely monitoring developments between Pakistan and India after recent exchanges of fire, and Trump mentioned a potential ceasefire and hostage deal proposal for Israel and Hamas within the next 24 hours.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to end the Biden-era U.S. chip export restrictions, known as the "AI diffusion rule," which limits the export of advanced AI chips. This decision effectively stops the restrictions from taking effect next week. Nvidia shares climbed in response to the news, as the company has been vocal about its belief that restricting chip exports limits U.S. leadership in advanced technology. The rule, proposed during Biden's last days, organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip exports, which were scheduled to take effect on May 15.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "breakthrough" trade deal with the United Kingdom, describing it as a comprehensive agreement that will strengthen the relationship between the two countries. UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer also hinted at the announcement, emphasizing his commitment to acting in the national interest. The UK is reportedly considering lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. The US and China are scheduled to meet in Switzerland to discuss resolving the trade war between the two countries.

          <p>As of Wednesday, May 7th, U.S. travelers are required to present a Real ID at airport checkpoints for domestic flights. Despite the new requirement, airports reported normal operations with wait times at security checkpoints remaining reasonable. The TSA has extra staff on hand to assist travelers and explain acceptable forms of identification. Travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other compliant form of identification may face extra security hurdles. The TSA estimates that about 81% of travelers are Real ID-compliant.

          <p>The House passed a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill instructs federal agencies to update documents and maps within six months. Democrats criticized the effort as a waste of taxpayer dollars. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost to be less than $500,000 over five years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt could make sense, but it's not always the best option. High interest rates and record consumer debt continue to strain borrowers. Paying off high-interest debt offers an immediate and higher return compared to long-term market returns. However, if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively, the inheritance money might be better used to build savings or invest.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut UK interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, marking the fourth reduction in the past year. Governor Andrew Bailey cited the slowdown in inflation as the reason for the cut, but warned of the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% but decided against it due to concerns about the impact of a global trade war. The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later.</p>
