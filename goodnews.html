          <h2>Chinese Research Suggests Sildenafil May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties</h2>

          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers from several prominent institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, may have potential as a cancer treatment. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug could combat tumors by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial components of the immune system's anti-tumor response. As tumors progress, these cells can become depleted or impaired. The study indicates that sildenafil could reverse this process and restore the cells' function, opening a potential new avenue for tumor immunotherapy strategies.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena community has shown overwhelming support for a 14-year-old boy, Christopher Luna Garcia, who took over his mother's tamale-selling business after she became fearful following recent immigration raids. Organized by a community activist, a "buy-out" event drew large crowds, helping the family raise over $1,500 to cover bills and rent. The story highlights the tangible impact of federal immigration crackdowns on families and the powerful, positive response from local residents. The event provided both financial relief and a strong sense of solidarity for the family.</p>

          <p>Hamas has provided a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-proposed plan for a ceasefire and hostage release in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, the group has requested several amendments, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a U.S. guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day ceasefire proposal reportedly includes a staggered release of living Israeli hostages and the bodies of others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. President Trump indicated a deal could be reached next week, ahead of a visit from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>The act of crying at work is being re-evaluated, with many experts arguing it should be seen as a sign of emotional intelligence rather than a liability. The discussion was recently highlighted by UK Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves's emotional appearance in Parliament. While some still view workplace tears negatively, career coaches suggest that compassionate employers who support emotional staff are more likely to retain motivated and happy workers. The article notes a cultural shift away from the old-school mentality of leaving emotions at the door, though biases against it can still exist, particularly for senior leaders.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has demonstrated his significant influence within the Trump administration by playing a pivotal role in passing a massive tax and spending bill. Vance engaged in crucial negotiations with Senate holdouts, cast tie-breaking votes, and made calls to House members to secure the legislation's passage. His involvement extends to foreign policy, where he has defended President Trump's decisions, such as the strikes on Iran, despite his previous non-interventionist stance. This active role aligns with expectations that Vance would serve as a key enforcer of Trump's agenda, positioning him as a potential successor in 2028.</p>

          <p>Credit scoring company FICO has announced it will begin including data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans in some of its credit score calculations starting this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of services like Affirm and Klarna, which allow consumers to pay for purchases in installments. The inclusion of BNPL data is intended to give lenders a more complete picture of a consumer's financial obligations. For consumers, making on-time payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their scores.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into institutional finance, with major players like Deutsche Bank and Robinhood building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced the launch of tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network, signaling a significant crossover between traditional finance and crypto. While ether's price lags behind bitcoin, the focus is shifting from speculation to utility, with institutions valuing Ethereum's stability and security for tokenized assets and stablecoins. This trend is reinforcing Ethereum's role as the potential backend for the future of global finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in renewable energy by launching a large offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. Developed by state-owned Sinopec, the project is part of a larger initiative that is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The solar panels, which rise and fall with the tide, benefit from the cooling effect of the water, boosting their energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent, marking a breakthrough for the industry.</p>

          <p>Following recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a new international agreement to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster." He emphasized that any new deal must place Iran's nuclear activities under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The call positions China as a key mediator and critic of the recent military actions, advocating for a diplomatic solution to the long-standing crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent studies offer conflicting views on whether culture shapes how people see the world, reigniting a long-standing scientific debate. One study found that people from Western, "carpentered" environments perceive an illusion with rectangles, while rural Namibians see circles. However, another study convincingly argues that the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion is not culturally dependent, as it affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth. The discrepancy suggests that while our brains are shaped by our environments, the relationship between culture and perception is complex and resists simple stereotypes, highlighting that we all experience a constructed reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, public swimming is officially permitted in Paris's Seine River. Authorities have opened three supervised outdoor pool zones, a legacy of the massive cleanup effort for the Paris 2024 Olympics. A €1.4 billion project was undertaken to improve water quality, which had been dangerously polluted, leading to a swimming ban in 1923. The new swimming areas, complete with lifeguards and amenities, are part of a broader city initiative to enhance quality of life and adapt to climate change, fulfilling a long-held promise to Parisians.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged outer ear tissue in mice. The research, published in the journal Science, identified a "genetic switch" involving retinoic acid, a derivative of vitamin A, that can be reactivated to promote the complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. The researchers believe this discovery proves the existence of a mechanism for organ regeneration that may also be present in other organs. While human application is still a distant goal, the findings offer hope for future medical treatments.</p>
