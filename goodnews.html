          <p>Nike's new CEO, Elliott Hill, is focusing on reviving the company's performance in China as a cornerstone of its global comeback strategy. The brand has faced challenges after a post-pandemic direct-to-consumer approach faltered, leading to a change in leadership. Hill plans to re-center the brand's image around sport, shifting away from a sportswear orientation in its 5,000 Chinese stores. Despite a recent 9% sales decline in Greater China, the market remains crucial, and the company is navigating structural challenges and U.S. tariffs to regain its footing and boost its stock price.</p>

          <p>Tori Dunlap, an entrepreneur and author known for promoting renting as a wealth-building strategy, has purchased her first home at age 31. Despite achieving millionaire status years ago, Dunlap previously valued the flexibility of renting, which allowed her to travel and invest in her business. However, a desire for stability and control over her living situation prompted the change. She opted for a mortgage to maintain cash reserves for unforeseen expenses, illustrating her philosophy that financial decisions should serve broader life goals rather than being purely investment-driven.</p>

          <p>As the price of gold surpasses a record $4,000 per ounce, some top financial advisors are cautioning investors against shifting too heavily into the precious metal. While gold is performing strongly amid economic uncertainty and a government shutdown, its long-term returns have historically trailed behind stocks. Experts note that equities offer compounding earnings and dividends, which gold does not, making them a more reliable hedge against inflation over time. Despite this, some prominent investors suggest allocating a portion of portfolios to gold as a safeguard during turbulent economic periods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has secured a multi-billion dollar deal to supply graphics processing units (GPUs) to OpenAI, a move that establishes it as a significant challenger in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia. The agreement is expected to generate tens of billions in revenue for AMD and could give OpenAI a stake in the company. This partnership diversifies the AI hardware landscape, potentially easing concerns about Nvidia's near-monopoly. The deal also helps OpenAI demonstrate that its supplier relationships are not exclusive, which could be important for future antitrust considerations.</p>

          <p>Bastian, a seven-year-old dog who was rescued from floodwaters during Hurricane Florence in 2018, has been named People magazine's World's Cutest Rescue Dog. After being brought to New Jersey, Bastian was initially overlooked at an adoption event before being taken home by his owner, Joelle Andres. To help the once "shut down" dog communicate, Andres trained him to use recordable buttons for words like "walk" and "treat." As part of the win, People will donate $1,000 to the Burlington County Animal Alliance of New Jersey, the organization that aided in his rescue.</p>

          <p>Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly become the first player in the sport's history to reach a net worth of one billion dollars. The 40-year-old Portuguese athlete's wealth was significantly boosted by a lucrative two-year contract with the Saudi Arabian team Al-Nassr FC, reportedly worth over $400 million. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, his total net worth is estimated at $1.4 billion, which includes career earnings, investments, and extensive endorsement deals. Unlike many other wealthy athletes, a large portion of Ronaldo's fortune is derived directly from his salary.</p>

          <p>Bardsey Island (Ynys Enlli), a remote island off the coast of Wales, is looking for a new family or couple to live and work there for the first time in nearly two decades. The 440-acre island is a national nature reserve with a year-round population of just three people. In 2023, it was designated the first International Dark Sky Sanctuary in Europe due to its lack of light pollution. The trust that manages the island is seeking adventurous, nature-loving individuals for what it calls "the opportunity of a lifetime" to become part of its small, off-grid community.</p>

          <p>Nabarun Dasgupta, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, has been awarded a MacArthur "genius" fellowship for his vital work in epidemiology and harm reduction during the U.S. overdose crisis. Dasgupta was among the first to identify the recent significant decline in fatal overdoses, challenging the prevailing narrative of an unstoppable crisis. Beyond data analysis, he has been instrumental in developing community-based programs, including a national network for distributing the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. His work combines rigorous science with direct collaboration with communities to create effective, life-saving interventions.</p>
