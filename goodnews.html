          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new $1.6 billion stake in UnitedHealth, a major health insurer currently facing a Justice Department investigation and public backlash over rising healthcare costs. The investment was built secretly over two quarters, and its disclosure caused the insurer's stock to rise significantly after a prolonged period of sharp decline and management changes. While the position is relatively small for Berkshire's massive portfolio and could be the work of his lieutenants, it signals potential confidence in the beleaguered company's future prospects and ability to navigate its challenges.

The potential investment is aimed at bolstering domestic chip manufacturing and funding new factories in Ohio, aligning with the administration's goal of onshoring high-tech production. The move comes as Intel works to regain its footing in the competitive AI chip market and reflects a broader trend of the U.S. government taking equity positions in key industries to advance national security and economic priorities.

          <p>The Supreme Court allowed a Mississippi law restricting minors' access to social media to remain in effect, but a concurring opinion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh revealed key insights into the court's process. Kavanaugh suggested the law is likely unconstitutional but voted with the majority because the plaintiffs had not proven "irreparable harm," a standard from the Court's expedited "shadow docket" procedures. This application is notable because the Court has seemingly waived this standard in cases involving the Trump administration. The opinion suggests that for most litigants, the stricter standard remains, while also signaling that the First Amendment is likely safe from further erosion.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has publicly called for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. He argued that the central bank should not be deterred by recent inflation data and should instead ease monetary policy to forestall a labor market slowdown and potentially create a million more jobs. Zervos, who has a markets-focused background, joins a growing list of potential successors to Jerome Powell and has consistently advocated for a half-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in ten months, offering potential relief for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This decline comes despite the Federal Reserve not yet cutting its benchmark interest rate, though anticipation of future cuts is a contributing factor. Key economic indicators, such as upcoming reports on unemployment and inflation, along with the Fed's September meeting, will be critical in determining the future direction of rates. While rates remain well above historic lows, the current trend provides a window of opportunity for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, researchers are training humanoid robots to perform tasks in human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team uses sensors to capture data on human movements and forces, teaching robots how to handle objects with appropriate delicacy or strength. The goal is to create machines that can adapt to changing surroundings, a significant challenge in robotics, and eventually assist with household chores or in medical settings. Rus emphasizes that these AI-powered robots are tools designed to extend human capabilities, with safety protocols built in.</p>

The gift is the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution and is intended to revolutionize cancer research, treatment, and patient care outcomes. This new pledge builds on a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising for the institute. The transformational gift aims to support the vision of Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer in cancer research, in the quest to eradicate the disease.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, driven largely by major government and military contracts. The company recently surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue, with U.S. government revenue growing 53%, highlighting its deep ties to agencies like the Department of Defense. Despite this success, its market valuation has reached astronomical levels, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants with much larger revenues. This premium valuation reflects immense investor confidence in its AI-powered future, fueled by both institutional and strong retail interest. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the U.K. have narrowly outperformed girls in achieving the top A-level grades (A* or A). The shift is statistically small but significant, with boys also strengthening their lead at the highest A* grade. Experts suggest the trend may be linked to the rising popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are studied by a higher proportion of boys and tend to award more top grades. While humanities subjects have declined in popularity, more female students overall still entered for A-levels, meaning more girls achieved at least an A grade in absolute numbers.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a schoolgirl from Glasgow, has been named one of TIME magazine's Girls of the Year for her invention of a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless people stay warm. She conceived the idea at age 12, and it was later developed into a working prototype by an engineering firm, with dozens of units distributed to a local homeless charity. For the honor, which is run in partnership with Lego, Rebecca was featured on a digital cover of the magazine as a mini-figure. The award recognizes young girls who are creating real-world impact and inspiring their communities.</p>
