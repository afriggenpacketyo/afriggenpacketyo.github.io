          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans for the "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, an ambitious project to expand the country's air defense system, with the goal of completion by the end of his term. U.S. officials claim it is necessary to protect against catastrophic attacks, though experts cite logistical and financial hurdles. The project, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù initiative, aims to intercept missiles from any location, including space, but faces skepticism regarding its feasibility and cost, estimated between $161 billion and $542 billion by the Congressional Budget Office. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed the project as a ‚Äúgame changer‚Äù and a ‚Äúgenerational investment in the security of America.‚Äù</p>

          <p>Chengdu, a city in southwestern China once derided for its slow pace, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young people seek an alternative to the hypercompetitive work culture of coastal cities. The city's population has increased by 30% in the last five years, and housing prices have risen faster than in any other major Chinese city. Chengdu's appeal lies in its less stressful environment, vibrant LGBTQ community, thriving hip-hop scene, and lower cost of living, making it an attractive destination for those disillusioned with the pressures of China's megacities.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the broadcaster lost US public funding due to accusations of liberal bias by the Trump administration. The EU's Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas emphasized the importance of Radio Free Europe in resisting authoritarian regimes, highlighting its role in delivering news to people under communist rule during the Cold War. While the funding won't cover all of Radio Free Europe's operations, it will focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus, supporting independent journalism in areas dependent on outside news sources.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Nottingham and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust have developed a new test that reduces the time to diagnose brain tumors from weeks to hours. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing is described as a "game changer" by surgeons, potentially improving care and treatment for thousands of patients. The technique has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumor, allowing for more radical surgery and quicker access to treatments like radiation and chemotherapy.</p>
