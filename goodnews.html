          <p>Elon Musk has announced his departure from government work, thanking President Donald Trump for "the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending." Musk led the Department of Government Efficiency, tasked with slashing the size of the federal government. His departure comes as his time as a special government employee is coming to an end, and he was critical of Trump's spending bill that's making its way through Congress.</p>

          <h2>Starmer Accuses Farage of Economic Policies Similar to Truss</h2>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has accused Reform UK's Nigel Farage of promoting economic policies that would "crash the economy", drawing comparisons to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer criticized Farage's "fantasy" economics and unfunded tax cuts, following Reform's gains in local elections. A Reform spokesperson dismissed the comments as a "desperate attack" from a party "behind in the polls". Starmer says Farage is making "the exact same bet" as the Conservative former PM, "that you can spend tens of billions on tax cuts without a proper way of paying for it". (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a full pardon to former GOP Congressman Michael Grimm, who was convicted of tax fraud and related charges in 2014. Grimm had underreported wages and revenue from his Manhattan restaurant before joining Congress. He resigned from Congress in 2015 and served eight months in prison. In September 2024, Grimm was paralyzed from the chest down after being thrown from a horse during a polo tournament.</p>
