          <p>A Chinese university team has successfully trialed a new brain-computer interface implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive method helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement, positioning it as a potential alternative to more invasive techniques like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein, which could significantly reduce surgical risks and recovery times for patients with paralysis.</p>

Acheampong, a Chelsea academy product, recently signed a new five-year contract and is expected to continue his development at Stamford Bridge rather than going out on loan.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet, including rice, miso soup, and fish, exhibit lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed over 12,000 employees and found a correlation between this diet and improved mental well-being. Researchers suggest that nutrients found in foods like seaweed, soy, and oily fish may contribute to this effect by assisting in the release of key neurotransmitters.</p>
