          <p>Actress Drew Barrymore revealed that her daughter demonstrated remarkable presence of mind following a serious e-bike accident while on a family trip in France. The incident left her daughter with a severely injured elbow, but she quickly fashioned a tourniquet from her own bra to control the bleeding before help could arrive. Barrymore, speaking on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," expressed her amazement at her daughter's calm and resourceful actions, which she credited with saving her life. The actress confirmed that her daughter is now fine after receiving medical care for the injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. In a recent interview, Goldin stated that Asia's economic success, including its rapid growth and poverty reduction, is a direct result of its integration into the global economy. He noted that while the process is becoming more fragmented, with the U.S. partially withdrawing, Asia continues to demonstrate its benefits. Goldin also cautioned that the interconnectedness of globalisation brings growing risks, such as pandemics, alongside its economic advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz delivered a commanding performance to defeat defending champion Jannik Sinner and win his second US Open title with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 victory. The 22-year-old showcased the full range of his versatile game, using powerful serving and a devastating forehand to keep Sinner off balance for most of the match. With this win, Alcaraz reclaims the world No. 1 ranking and becomes the second-youngest man in the Open era to win six Grand Slam titles. The final was notably delayed due to extensive security measures for President Trump's attendance.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom government has launched a new Defence Industrial Strategy, supported by £250 million in funding, aimed at boosting regional economies and creating highly skilled jobs. The strategy includes five new "Defence Growth Deals" for areas in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, focusing on developing local strengths in sectors like marine autonomy, advanced materials, and cyber security. Officials anticipate that the investment could create up to 50,000 new defence-related jobs by 2035. The plan is also a response to evolving global threats, aligning with the government's goal to increase defence spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article in the South China Morning Post argues that Hong Kong is showing clear signs of a post-pandemic recovery, with tourism and business travel returning to the city. The author points to a revitalized IPO market and major international conferences as evidence that the city is benefiting from its unique status as a capitalist hub within China. However, the piece cautions that Hong Kong must move quickly to balance its integration with mainland China while preserving its distinct international financial identity. The author suggests Beijing should encourage more international engagement to help cement the city's global standing amid skepticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's national football team secured a much-needed 3-1 victory against Northern Ireland in their World Cup qualifying match, though the performance was far from convincing. After an early goal by Serge Gnabry, Germany's play became sloppy, allowing Northern Ireland to equalize and drawing boos from the home crowd at halftime. Manager Julian Nagelsmann's substitutions, particularly the introduction of Nadiem Amiri, proved decisive in changing the game's tempo and securing the win. The result provides relief for Germany but highlights the team's ongoing challenges as they continue their qualifying campaign.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell, 21, scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, fueling discussion about his role in the national team.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended a frustrating five-game losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles, largely thanks to a powerful offensive display by Shohei Ohtani.

Hassett warned that historical examples show that when political leaders take over central banks, it often leads to inflation and economic hardship for consumers. His remarks align with recent calls from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for a review of the Federal Reserve to ensure its independence and prevent "mission creep." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained professional despite a team-made controversy at the Italian Grand Prix. A strategic pit stop decision, compounded by a slow stop for Norris, inadvertently swapped their positions on the track. The team quickly ordered Piastri to let Norris back through to restore the original order, a move based on team principles of fairness. While Piastri initially questioned the call, he complied, and both drivers later publicly supported the decision, showcasing a level of sportsmanship that has been rare in previous intra-team championship battles.</p>
