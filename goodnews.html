          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has accepted the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. While Israel has not officially confirmed this agreement, a Hamas official indicated readiness for a deal that ends the war. The proposal, facilitated by Qatar and Egypt, hinges on the release of hostages held in Gaza, a key demand for Israel amid ongoing domestic pressure. The international community is also pushing for renewed aid deliveries and a partial Israeli military withdrawal during the truce.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. auto insurance costs rising by over 50% in the last three years, drivers are seeking ways to lower their premiums without compromising on security. Experts suggest several strategies, including maximizing all available discounts for things like anti-theft devices or paperless billing. Bundling auto insurance with other policies, such as home or renters insurance, can also lead to significant savings. Additionally, drivers can review their coverage needs, potentially dropping collision and comprehensive options for older, less valuable cars, and consider raising their deductible for lower monthly payments.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States has reached a new trade agreement with Vietnam, though specific details of the deal were not immediately released. The announcement came shortly before the expiration of a 90-day pause on many of the administration's "reciprocal tariffs." Previously, Vietnamese imports were subject to a broad 46% tariff under the administration's protectionist trade policies. It remains unclear how this new agreement will alter the tariff structure for goods imported from Vietnam.</p>

          <p>A Virgin Australia domestic flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene to remove the reptile, which was identified as a harmless 2-foot green tree snake. The snake catcher noted that had he not captured it on the first attempt, the entire Boeing 737 might have needed to be evacuated and searched.

Manager Dave Roberts believes the team's "best baseball is still ahead," pointing to the potential for improvement as players return from injury and find their rhythm. The team's ability to win consistently without being at full strength suggests a high ceiling for their performance heading into the postseason.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority has struck down the state's 1849 abortion ban, ruling that it was superseded by a 1985 law permitting abortions until fetal viability. The 1849 law had been dormant since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision but was argued to be reactivated after Roe was overturned in 2022. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers and patients in the state, confirming that consensual abortions are not criminalized under the archaic statute.

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce their strategic reliance on China, which dominates the global market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, driven by concerns over cybersecurity and China's geopolitical ties. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and sensors. Taiwan is actively developing a "non-red" supply chain independent of Chinese influence.</p>

Experts recommend focusing on roof maintenance, as a sturdy or new roof can significantly reduce the risk of storm damage and may qualify for insurance discounts. Other effective measures include installing storm shutters, sealing gaps around windows and doors, and regularly cleaning gutters to prevent water damage. These actions not only enhance a home's resilience against weather but can also help lower the likelihood of filing a costly claim. (not investment advice)</p>
