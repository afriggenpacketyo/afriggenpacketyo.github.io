          <p>The 2025 J.D. Power North American Airport Satisfaction Study has identified the top-performing 'mega-airports,' defined as those serving 33 million or more passengers annually. The study evaluates overall passenger satisfaction based on seven key factors, including ease of travel, terminal facilities, airport staff, and food and retail offerings. According to a J.D. Power expert, while the ongoing government shutdown is causing disruptions in air travel, it has not yet significantly impacted these satisfaction rankings.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece commends two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's rationale, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," was "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The article contrasts these courageous, fact-based decisions with what it characterizes as the Supreme Court's excessive deference to the executive branch, arguing for stronger judicial checks on presidential power.</p>
