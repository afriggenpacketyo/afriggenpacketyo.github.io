          <h2>Analysis Explores Political Durability of Universal vs. Means-Tested Welfare Programs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid, a debate has intensified over the best strategy for expanding the U.S. welfare state. This article analyzes the political arguments for universal programs, such as Social Security, versus targeted, means-tested benefits. While proponents of universality argue such programs are more politically resilient because they benefit a broader constituency, the historical record is mixed, with some universal programs like unemployment insurance also facing cuts. Ultimately, the piece suggests that while universal programs may have substantive policy advantages, such as easier administration, their political superiority is not guaranteed, especially given the difficulty of enacting the large tax increases required to fund them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Reddit user claiming to be an airline baggage claims manager is warning travelers not to discard their luggage tags at the airport due to a potential fraud scheme. The user alleges that scammers are using information from the tags to submit fraudulent claims for missing items, complicating the reimbursement process for legitimate claims. While the tags contain limited information like a name and flight number, the poster believes it is enough for thieves to create a fake identity and file for payment. A travel industry expert expressed skepticism about the scam's prevalence but still advised travelers to keep their tags until any baggage issues are resolved and then discard them at home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, presents a significant tonal shift from the darker portrayals of the Zack Snyder era, embracing a lighter and more playful narrative. This review notes that the movie functions as an intentional throwback to the 1978 classic, which may please fans tired of the grim superhero trend but could disappoint others with its dramatic simplicity. While the film incorporates modern elements like social media, its core feels nostalgic, even replicating specific plot points from the original. David Corenswet's performance as Superman is seen as convincing and empathetic, while Rachel Brosnahan's Lois Lane brings a welcome modernity to the character.</p>

          <p>Disneyland has announced that its iconic Haunted Mansion attraction will close to the public starting August 11 for its annual seasonal transformation. The temporary closure is a yearly routine that allows park staff to convert the ride into the "Haunted Mansion Holiday" theme, inspired by Tim Burton's "The Nightmare Before Christmas." This popular overlay is a staple of the Halloween and holiday seasons at the resort. The attraction is scheduled to reopen to guests on August 22, just in time for the start of Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort.</p>

          <h2>Review: New 'Superman' Movie Succeeds by Grounding Hero in a World of Peers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 15:14:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>James Gunn's new "Superman" film is praised in this review for its fresh approach of placing the hero in a world already populated with other super-powered individuals. This narrative choice helps define Superman's unique, earnest character by contrasting him with his peers and a skeptical public. The film intentionally adopts a sincere, lighthearted tone reminiscent of Saturday-morning cartoons, moving away from the grimness of previous iterations. David Corenswet's portrayal emphasizes a relatable, regular-guy sensibility, and the movie builds a world where even Superman's allies question if anyone can truly be so altruistic, mirroring modern cynicism about inherent goodness.</p>

          <p>Members of the UK Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England. The legislation, supported by a 415-98 vote, aims to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and giving fans a greater voice. The bill was reintroduced by the new Labour government after a previous version failed to pass before the last election. An amendment to make more Premier League games available on free-to-air television was rejected, with the government citing the need to balance public access with broadcasting revenue for investment in the sport.</p>

          <p>For savers with $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between fixed rates and liquidity. This article calculates the potential earnings for both, showing that short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher returns than top high-yield savings accounts. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.40% APY would earn $880, while a savings account at 4.30% would earn $860, assuming the rate remains static. However, for longer terms, the variable rate of a savings account could potentially outperform a fixed CD rate, though this is not guaranteed as rates are likely to change.

          <p>The discourse surrounding artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly radicalized, splitting into two opposing factions: zealous believers and staunch skeptics. This article explores how industry leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman portray AI's rapid advancement as an inevitable singularity, while critics dismiss the technology as an overhyped "stochastic parrot." This polarization is fueled by massive financial investment and the technology's growing ubiquity, creating parallel realities where evidence is often spun to support either side. The piece argues this ideological war obscures more nuanced discussions about AI's real-world impacts on employment, society, and the environment.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to allow many travelers to keep their shoes on during airport security screenings, ending a rule that has been in place for nearly two decades. According to people familiar with the matter, the agency briefed industry members on the upcoming change this week. The requirement for most passengers to remove their shoes began in 2006, following the failed attempt by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber," to ignite explosives on a flight in 2001. Travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program are already exempt from this rule, and this change would extend that convenience to a broader group of passengers.</p>

          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the trade-offs. Lenders often recoup these waived upfront fees by charging a higher interest rate or imposing penalties if the line of credit is closed early, typically within three to five years. This article advises borrowers to calculate the break-even point to see if paying a higher rate over time is more expensive than paying closing costs upfront. Lenders may also have stricter credit and equity requirements for these products, so homeowners should read the fine print carefully before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this, spending is projected to hit a record $23.8 billion, with shoppers expected to hunt for deals on electronics and back-to-school supplies, categories affected by tariffs on Chinese imports. While President Trump's trade policies are designed to pressure other countries, the costs are often passed to U.S. consumers. So far, a strong job market and retailers absorbing costs have sustained consumer spending, but the extended sale will be a key indicator of shoppers' willingness to spend.</p>
