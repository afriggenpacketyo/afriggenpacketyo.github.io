          <p>Greek police successfully intercepted a significant drug shipment, seizing nearly 600 pounds of cocaine hidden within a container of bananas from Ecuador. The operation was initiated based on a tip from the UK's National Crime Agency, leading to the arrest of three men. Authorities removed most of the drugs from the container before allowing it to be transported to its destination near Athens, where the suspects were apprehended. This seizure is the latest in a global trend of drug traffickers using banana shipments to conceal and transport large quantities of cocaine.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei is expected to announce a new technology aimed at decreasing China's dependence on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are crucial for artificial intelligence hardware. The announcement is reportedly scheduled for a financial AI forum in Shanghai. This development would mark a significant step in Huawei's efforts to build a self-sufficient AI hardware ecosystem amid US sanctions. Currently, the HBM semiconductor market is dominated by US firms like Micron and AMD, along with South Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US is facing a severe shortage of child care workers, a field that is overwhelmingly female. The article suggests that recruiting more men, who currently make up only 3-6% of the workforce, could be a key solution. However, men are often deterred by low pay, societal perceptions of caregiving as "women's work," and persistent fears of false accusations of inappropriate contact with children. Despite research showing the benefits of male role models in early development, systemic efforts to recruit men into child care lag behind similar pushes in K-12 education, though some smaller-scale initiatives are emerging.</p>

          <p>Media mogul Byron Allen is re-entering late-night television as his show "Comics Unleashed" takes over the 12:30 a.m. slot on CBS. The move comes as the genre faces significant financial pressures, highlighted by the upcoming end of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" due to high production costs. Allen's business model is unique: his company buys the airtime from CBS and sells most of the advertising, making it a zero-cost programming option for the network. The show features a panel of comedians performing evergreen, non-political material, designed for a long shelf life in syndication.</p>

          <p>Amid moves by several Western nations to recognize Palestine, this article explains the complex process of what defines a state in international law. While the 1933 Montevideo Convention outlines four key criteria—territory, population, government, and capacity for foreign relations—international recognition is a crucial, though unofficial, component. Gaining full UN membership is a separate, often political, process requiring Security Council approval, which has been a barrier for entities like Palestine and Kosovo despite widespread recognition. Lacking full UN membership can expose a state to isolation and unequal treatment, highlighting that statehood is a fluid and often contentious diplomatic process.</p>

          <p>Drivers over the age of 70 in England and Wales could face mandatory eye tests to renew their licenses under new road safety proposals. The plan, part of a broader strategy to reduce road fatalities, could result in driving bans for those who fail. The move follows a coroner's report that labeled the UK's self-reporting system for vision problems as the "laxest in Europe." Other proposals under consideration include lowering the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and issuing points for not wearing a seatbelt, as the government aims to implement its first new Road Safety Strategy in a decade.</p>

          <h2>Germany Sets New Tourism Record Driven by Domestic Travel</h2>

          <p>Germany's accommodation sector has recorded its highest-ever number of overnight stays in the first half of a year, with 223.3 million bookings. This record was achieved despite a 12.7% decrease in foreign visitors compared to the same period last year, which hosted the UEFA European Football Championship. The surge was driven by a strong increase in domestic travel, with German travelers accounting for over 80% of all stays. Separately, official data revealed that over 11% of individuals deported from Germany in 2024 were minors, prompting criticism from the opposition Left Party.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global long-only funds invested a net US$2.7 billion into Chinese stocks in July, a significant increase from the US$1.2 billion inflow in June, according to a Morgan Stanley report. This marks two consecutive months of net buying, signaling a potential reversal of the capital flight seen in recent years. Analysts suggest the trend could strengthen, driven by de-escalating US-China trade tensions, better-than-expected economic growth, and fair valuations compared to other markets. This renewed interest from global investors is seen as a positive sign for China's equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shanghai is launching an ambitious, citywide initiative to redevelop its urban villages, starting in 2026. The three-year plan represents a significant push to overhaul these areas and aligns with China's national strategy of shifting focus from large-scale expansion to improving existing urban infrastructure. In addition to the urban village project, the city aims to renovate all small, thin-walled housing by 2027 and continue its ongoing upgrades of older residential neighborhoods. This comprehensive renewal campaign is expected to provide a boost to both local consumption and investment in China's commercial hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in negotiations to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England playmaker has fallen out of favor at City, making only seven league starts last season and being excluded from key squads. While a permanent move to a Champions League team was his preference, no such offers have materialized. A move to Everton would provide Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career with a central role at their new stadium and aim to regain his spot in the England national team.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer has restored its click and collect service, 15 weeks after a significant cyber attack forced a halt to online operations. The retailer, which had already resumed online orders in June, now also allows customers to return online purchases to its stores. The ransomware attack disrupted both online and in-store business, with M&S estimating it will reduce profits for the year by approximately £300 million. The company has warned customers to remain cautious of potential phishing scams, as some customer data was stolen during the incident, which led to several arrests in July.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a 25-year-old British meteorologist who died in an accident in Antarctica in 1959, have been found 65 years later. Bell fell into a crevasse while working for the precursor to the British Antarctic Survey, and his body was never recovered. Polish researchers discovered his bones, along with personal items, in January at the foot of a melting glacier on King George Island. The discovery has brought a sense of astonishment and closure to his surviving 86-year-old brother, who is now planning a final resting place for him.</p>

          <p>The Boston Public Library is partnering with OpenAI and Harvard Law School to digitize a vast collection of historic government documents and make them more accessible to the public using AI. The project aims to enhance the metadata of thousands of documents dating back to the 1800s, allowing users to search and cross-reference the materials from anywhere. In this public-private partnership, AI companies help fund the digitization and in return can train their large language models on the high-quality, out-of-copyright data, which is also made available to the public, improving the overall data ecosystem.</p>
