          <p>Canada Goose shares experienced a significant surge after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, despite pulling its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited unpredictable global trade environment and dynamic consumer spending patterns as reasons for not providing a financial outlook. The article highlights that the company remains confident in its brand strength and ability to adapt, noting that most of its products are not directly impacted by tariffs.

          <p>Despite President Trump's call for Chinese manufacturers to build plants in the U.S., Republicans are resisting Chinese investment due to national security concerns. Companies like Gotion and CATL are attempting to establish factories in the U.S., which would create jobs and transfer advanced battery technology. The Los Angeles Times article argues that this resistance is based on paranoia and ignores the potential economic benefits, such as good-paying jobs and a more advanced manufacturing sector. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent advocates for a rational approach to economic rebalancing with China, rather than one based on paranoia.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise bill to eliminate taxes on tips, potentially benefiting a small subset of the U.S. workforce. The CNBC article examines the implications of this policy, noting that it could primarily benefit moderate to middle-income workers in tipped occupations such as restaurants, hotels, and courier services. However, the policy may also lead to issues such as income misclassification and a shift in compensation structures. Experts caution that tipping is a social behavior, making it difficult to predict the policy's long-term effects. (not investment advice)</p>
