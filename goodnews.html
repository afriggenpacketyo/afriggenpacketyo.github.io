          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major defense review that includes plans to construct up to 12 new attack submarines, replacing the current fleet starting in the late 2030s. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to confirm a ¬£15 billion investment in the nuclear warhead program alongside this initiative. The Strategic Defence Review, led by Lord Robertson, aims to reshape the UK's armed forces to address growing threats and will include commitments to munitions production, long-range weapons development, and cyber defense enhancements. This project is anticipated to support 30,000 jobs and apprenticeships, reinforcing the UK's commitment to national and NATO security amid increasing global tensions.</p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz has directly appealed to Chinese President Xi Jinping to assist in ending the war in Ukraine, marking a shift from values-based idealism to strategic realism. Merz emphasized the war's impact on Germany's national security and urged China to support joint U.S.-European efforts for a ceasefire. This approach contrasts with the previous German government's more critical stance towards China, focusing instead on mutual interests such as climate, trade, and stability. The call underscores Germany's renewed focus on realpolitik and its desire to leverage China's influence to achieve a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

Beyond the physical damage, the attack sends a message to both Russia and Ukraine's Western allies, asserting that Ukraine is still actively fighting and has the capacity to inflict significant damage.
