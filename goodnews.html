          <p>President Trump has selected Fox News host Jeanine Pirro as the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, replacing Ed Martin, whose nomination faced Senate opposition. Trump praised Pirro's qualifications and past experience as a district attorney. Pirro, a staunch Trump supporter, will step down from Fox News to assume the role. This move places a familiar figure in a key prosecutorial position within the Justice Department, overseeing criminal and civil cases in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the start date should be moved back to 1931, when Japan invaded Manchuria, rather than the traditionally recognized 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's contributions and sacrifices in the war against fascism, arguing that the current Western-centric view diminishes China's role. The academics made these calls at a second world war history seminar in Beijing, emphasizing the need to acknowledge China's early resistance against Japanese aggression.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals imported from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis to foster a trade deal. This signals a potential shift away from India's protectionist policies, driven by Trump's tariffs on Indian exports. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and a trade deal could significantly boost India's economic growth. While concerns exist about the impact on domestic manufacturing, some experts believe certain sectors may not be significantly affected.</p>

          <p>Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou defended his team's progress after they reached the Europa League final, dismissing criticism of their league form. Spurs defeated Bodo/Glimt to advance to the final, where they will face Manchester United. Postecoglou emphasized the importance of the final for the club and its supporters, highlighting the hope it provides after a challenging period. He added that people are fearing that - that it actually might happen, and let's see how we can tear it down somehow and diminish it somehow by saying it's been a poor season and we don't deserve this or we don't deserve that, or somehow comparing us to Man United.</p>
