          <p>Apple has announced a new commitment to invest an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The plan, revealed alongside President Trump, is projected to create 20,000 new American jobs. This initiative includes the development of new facilities, such as a smart glass production line in Kentucky and a server manufacturing plant in Houston. The move is part of a broader effort to reshore elements of Apple's supply chain and increase American-made components in its products.</p>

The concert featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington's symphonic works with Maurice Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos, performed by soloist Seong-Jin Cho. The review praises the orchestra's versatility and Dudamel's command, noting the L.A. Phil's rare ability to swing. The homecoming was described as bittersweet, as Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra had to cancel its upcoming appearance due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to crack down on the poorly regulated non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, high-risk procedures like Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. Furthermore, clinics offering popular treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers will be required to obtain a license by meeting strict safety and training standards. The move, welcomed by industry watchdogs, aims to address the dangers posed by unqualified practitioners and unsafe practices that have grown in popularity.</p>

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, historical photos are juxtaposed with images of the thriving modern cities to illustrate their remarkable recovery. The article recounts the immense devastation of August 1945, which led to the deaths of over 210,000 people and the near-total destruction of both cities. Today, these cities stand as powerful symbols of resilience and peace. At a recent ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor warned against the rising acceptance of nuclear weapons, urging world leaders to learn from the tragedies of the past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, anticipates a record number of 18-year-old students will secure their first-choice university spot this year. This is partly due to universities seeking stability from domestic student enrollment amid uncertainty surrounding international student numbers. As a result, institutions are expected to be more flexible, potentially accepting applicants who narrowly miss their conditional grade offers. This applicant-friendly environment comes as tuition fees in England and Wales are set to rise for the first time since 2017 to help university finances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological evidence suggests that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe that some residents, unable to relocate, resettled the site, creating a precarious settlement that lasted until the 5th century. These inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried homes and repurposed lower levels as cellars, scavenging for valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held image of Pompeii as a city frozen in time, revealing a forgotten chapter of survival and reoccupation after the cataclysmic event.</p>
