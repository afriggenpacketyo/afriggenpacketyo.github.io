          <p>Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley semiconductor company, is experiencing a significant surge in its market valuation and stock price, driven by its specialized purple active electrical cables (AECs) that are crucial for high-performance AI data centers. Major hyperscalers, including Elon Musk's xAI, Amazon, and Microsoft, are increasingly adopting these cables, which analysts predict will fuel substantial revenue growth for Credo through 2028, with sales potentially nearing $1 billion. The company's unique AEC technology offers enhanced reliability over traditional fiber optics by preventing "link flaps," positioning it as a key supplier in the expanding trillion-dollar AI infrastructure market. Despite its impressive growth, Credo's future remains susceptible to potential spending pullbacks from major cloud providers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Hong Kong's Northern Metropolis should evolve beyond a mere tech and housing hub to become a significant zone for cultural emancipation within the Greater Bay Area, rather than just another new town. The article contends that Hong Kong's development thinking has been overly focused on transport infrastructure, while the current era demands a shift towards cultural influence and innovation, especially given the sophisticated technological hardware already present. By prioritizing cultural content creation and moving past a property-led development model, the Metropolis could elevate the region's global standing and foster a unique identity. This approach would address deeper societal needs beyond economic growth.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk fell after President Trump stated his administration aims to cap the cost of brand-name GLP-1 weight loss drugs at $150 per month, a significant reduction from their current list prices. Trump highlighted the stark disparity between U.S. and international drug costs, indicating a strong push for drugmakers to align prices with those in other developed nations. This proposal, if implemented, could make popular medications like Lilly's Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's Wegovy competitive with cheaper compounded alternatives, potentially impacting pharmaceutical companies' revenues while significantly increasing consumer access and affordability. The administration is actively engaging in price discussions with drugmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump suggested that both Russia and Ukraine should declare victory in their ongoing conflict and "let history decide." Zelenskyy, who met Trump to discuss potential long-range weapons like Tomahawks, noted they opted against public discussion of such escalation to avoid further conflict. Trump also expressed openness to a "Tomahawk-for-drone" exchange with Ukraine, while revealing plans for an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. This article highlights Trump's unique diplomatic approach to ending the war, even as Ukrainian officials reported new Russian strikes just hours before Trump's call with Putin.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints clinched the top position in the Prem table with a decisive 36-19 victory over Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park, earning a five-try bonus point. This win propelled Saints ahead of reigning champions Bath, showcasing their strength despite playing half an hour a man down due to two sin-bins for JJ van der Mescht. Newcastle, however, continues its league victory drought, which dates back to November last year, failing to capitalize on their numerical advantage. The article highlights Northampton's impressive performance and Newcastle's ongoing struggles to secure a win in the current campaign.</p>

          <p>Boeing has received Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, marking a significant milestone almost two years after a near-catastrophic midair incident led to output restrictions. The FAA stated that extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines ensure the increase will be safely managed, indicating renewed regulatory confidence. This approval is crucial for Boeing's financial turnaround, as the company aims to balance inventory with supply chain capabilities and hasn't posted an annual profit since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg expects further increases, underscoring the importance of this step in stabilizing the top U.S. manufacturer.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advancing plans for a privately financed $250 million White House ballroom and a proposed arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial, aiming to cement his architectural legacy. The ballroom project, fully financed by donors including tech executives and through settlement money, has drawn criticism from Democrats concerned about transparency, potential foreign contributions, and the President's focus. California Rep. Mark Takano introduced bills to ban donor names on White House structures and halt federal construction during shutdowns, though their passage is unlikely. Trump views these projects as a personal passion and a respite from weighty international affairs.</p>

The company plans to use the proceeds to pay off debt, as Del Taco has recently struggled, leading to temporary closures of some Colorado locations.
