          <p>The BRICS economic bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has approved its first joint climate finance framework. This nonbinding framework outlines BRICS priorities for climate action funding, including multilateral development bank reform, concessional finance scaling, and private capital mobilization for the Global South. The document, to be submitted to BRICS heads of state in July, signals a shift towards proactive coordination in international negotiations ahead of COP30 in Brazil. Tatiana Rosito, Brazil's finance ministry's international affairs secretary, highlighted the framework's role in guiding collective BRICS action on climate finance.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are declining again, making them one of the cheapest ways to borrow money right now. The average rate has dropped to 8.14%, but borrowers should be aware that rates could rise or fall unexpectedly due to the variable nature of HELOCs. It's important to calculate long-term affordability closely, considering potential rate changes, and homeowners could refinance into a home equity loan with a fixed interest rate in the future. Those contemplating a HELOC should weigh these factors to make an informed decision and position themselves for borrowing success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the scope of federally mandated environmental impact statements for major projects, expediting approvals for infrastructure development. The justices ruled 8-0 in favor of Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County, stating that environmental impact studies should focus on the project at hand, not secondary impacts far afield. Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the 1970 legislative acorn has grown over the years into a judicial oak that has hindered infrastructure development under the guise of just a little more process. The decision is expected to streamline project approvals nationwide.</p>
