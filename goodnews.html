          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that foreign criminals should expect deportation, arguing that human rights law should not impede such actions. Speaking at the Council of Europe, Mahmood emphasized the UK's commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) but called for its evolution to address modern threats. She highlighted instances where foreign criminals used Article 8 of the ECHR to avoid deportation, deeming it out of step with common sense. The government plans new legislation to clarify the application of Article 8 in immigration cases, ensuring Parliament's control over borders and addressing public concerns about the misuse of human rights protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article explores why straight men are often perceived as bad at gossiping, examining the ethics, stigma, and history of gossip, and who gets to participate. It challenges the assumption that men don't gossip, citing a study that men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates, but women gossip neutrally more often. The article suggests men's lack of gossip skills stems from fewer cultural opportunities to chat freely and a fear of appearing "messy." It also links the inability to gossip to the male loneliness epidemic, highlighting the importance of sharing stories for building intimacy.</p>
