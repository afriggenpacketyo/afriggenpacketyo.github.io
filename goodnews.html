          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in the trade war between the world‚Äôs two largest economies. According to a joint statement, both countries will suspend their respective tariffs for 90 days while they negotiate. The United States will reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. Global markets responded positively to the news, with stock futures and benchmark indexes in Hong Kong and Europe surging. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that both sides have a shared interest in balanced trade and neither side wanted a decoupling.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. This decision follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the organization to disarm and dissolve itself. The move could reshape Turkish politics and potentially influence other Kurdish militias in neighboring countries, particularly in Syria. President Erdogan may benefit from the PKK‚Äôs dissolution, potentially expanding his support among Kurds and strengthening his position for future elections, according to analysts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Royal experts suggest that Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal stems from learning from Princess Diana's experiences, particularly by avoiding rushing into royal life and maintaining a focus on duty. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age and faced intense media scrutiny, Kate was more mature and had a longer courtship with Prince William. According to author Edward White, Kate's approach is more reminiscent of older generations of royal figures, emphasizing duty and avoiding unnecessary attention. With a supportive family and spouse, Kate has navigated royal life with ease, contrasting Diana's struggles with royal bureaucracy and press intrusion.</p>
