          <p>The Atlantic reviews Mike Flanagan's film adaptation of Stephen King's novella, "The Life of Chuck," noting its success in translating the story's elegiac and philosophical themes to the screen. The film, told in three chapters, explores the life of an ordinary accountant through a non-linear narrative, capturing the bittersweet and familiar core of King's writing. Flanagan's direction highlights the ordinary foundation upon which the supernatural is built, using different aspect ratios and tones to give each storyline its own life.

Rae's debut, however, embraces strangeness and experimentation, evoking electronic artists like Aphex Twin and Timbaland, while retaining a simple allure.
