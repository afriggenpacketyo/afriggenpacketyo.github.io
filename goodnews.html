          <p>Toyota Motor announced a June-quarter operating profit that surpassed analyst expectations but still marked an 11% year-on-year decline, its third consecutive quarterly drop. The decrease is attributed to pressures from U.S. tariffs, which have compelled Japanese automakers to reduce prices to maintain market share in the United States. Despite the profit dip, the company has experienced strong global demand, reporting record worldwide sales in the first half of the year. The article notes a potential future reduction in tariffs following a new trade deal with Tokyo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July revealed surprisingly strong performance, with exports growing 7.2% year-on-year, significantly beating economists' forecasts. Imports also saw their largest increase in a year, rising 4.1% and suggesting a recovery in domestic demand. This robust trade activity has provided strong support to the Chinese economy this year, although some analysts caution the momentum could slow. The positive data comes as a U.S.-China tariff truce is set to expire, leaving future trade relations uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, just months after returning from a challenging mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Wilmore co-piloted the first crewed test flight of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which experienced multiple technical issues that extended his and his crewmate's stay in orbit from eight days to over nine months. Despite the difficulties and public narrative of being "stranded," Wilmore maintained he was prepared for the extended mission and would fly on Starliner again. His retirement follows a pattern set by the astronauts who flew SpaceX's first crewed mission.</p>

          <p>A review of Gustavo Dudamel's recent performance at the Hollywood Bowl celebrates his return for the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The concert featured a savvy program blending the music of Duke Ellington with the jazz-influenced piano concertos of Maurice Ravel, performed by soloist Seong-Jin Cho. The critic praised the orchestra's rare ability to "swing" during the Ellington pieces and Dudamel's clear command and rapport with the ensemble. The review notes the bittersweet context of the performance, as Dudamel's Venezuelan orchestra had to cancel its upcoming appearance.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement, made alongside President Trump, is seen as a strategic move by the tech giant to avoid threatened tariffs on its products, which rely on a global supply chain. While final assembly of iPhones will remain overseas for now, the investment focuses on increasing U.S.-based production of key components. The move highlights the pressure U.S. companies face in navigating the administration's confrontational trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK to Introduce Licensing Scheme for Botox and Other Cosmetic Procedures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-06 20:02:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, clinics will require a license to offer popular treatments like Botox and dermal fillers, ensuring practitioners meet strict safety and training standards. The most high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which has been welcomed by the industry, follows growing concern over the lack of regulation and reports of dangerous complications from rogue operators.</p>
