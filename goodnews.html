          <p>A single-engine plane made an emergency landing at Riviera Country Club due to engine issues, but no injuries were reported. The plane had three passengers on board, and the pilot skillfully avoided hazards while landing on the golf course. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the accident. The golf course, which will host the Olympic Games in 2028, experienced temporary disruptions due to the landing. The 2025 edition of the Genesis Invitational was played at Torrey Pines due to Riviera Country Club being damaged by wildfires earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm, violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments to the Constitution. The judge stated that using governmental powers to target lawyers based on their representation of clients and progressive employment policies is contrary to the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has ceased shipping products directly from China to the United States, opting instead to fulfill U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change comes as the Trump administration closed a loophole allowing low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after Trump's decision, and has now transitioned to a local fulfillment model. The company claims pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged as it recruits more U.S. sellers to the platform.</p>

Postecoglou believes his players need to stay positive and avoid falling into the trap of expecting something to go wrong, in order to create a winning culture. He also confirmed that Lucas Bergvall will likely miss the rest of the season with an ankle injury.</p>
