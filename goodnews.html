          <p>A small 3.0 magnitude earthquake, centered near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area on Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the minor quake caused brief shaking but resulted in no significant damage or injuries. Residents described the event as startling, with some comparing the sound and vibration to a vehicle collision. This tremor follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the region in April 2024, with officials noting that while infrequent, such seismic activity is not entirely unexpected on the East Coast.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy installations, driven primarily by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop panels. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations for projects under 75 megawatts and the increasing cost-effectiveness of solar compared to natural gas. However, the future of this boom faces challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing grid constraints, which require significant investment in storage and infrastructure. The success of solar-powered communities like Babcock Ranch, which withstood Hurricane Ian, highlights the potential for energy resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced plans to impose prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal immigration services. This move aims to combat the criminal gangs promoting dangerous crossings of the English Channel, with a record 25,000 people having made the journey this year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the government is determined to stop these immoral criminals who exploit migrants for profit. The opposition Conservative Party criticized the Labour government's plan as insufficient, advocating for automatic deportation of unauthorized arrivals.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed to generate enough offense to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, clinching a series win despite a persistent team-wide slump. After struggling to score for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and a key sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout. The victory provided a positive end to a nine-game road trip, though concerns remain about the lineup's low productivity throughout July and early August.</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys are running for public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the political contamination of the agency under President Trump. These former career prosecutors, who resigned in protest of recent policy changes and purges, are now seeking elected positions from the U.S. House to local city attorney offices. Candidates like Ryan Crosswell in Pennsylvania and Erika Evans in Seattle are campaigning on platforms of restoring the rule of law and challenging the administration's actions, leveraging their public service backgrounds to appeal to voters.</p>

          <p>Following the British and Irish Lions' series victory in Australia, Ireland centre Bundee Aki shared an extraordinary personal story. He revealed that his wife, Kayla, had given birth to their fifth child, a daughter named Aine, in the back of a car on the way to the hospital in New Zealand. The birth occurred just before the first Test match of the series in Brisbane, meaning Aki had not yet met his newborn. Aki praised his wife as a "powerful, strong woman" after recounting how she video-called him from the car to show him their new baby just minutes after she was born.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts likely to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The regulator advises consumers to contact their loan providers directly rather than using claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won the Hungarian Grand Prix, closing the championship gap with his teammate Oscar Piastri to just nine points. The victory was Norris's third in the last four races, but it came after a difficult start where he dropped to fifth place on the first lap. A strategic switch to a one-stop tire strategy proved successful, allowing him to recover and ultimately take the win. Norris acknowledged he is not making the title fight easy for himself and aims to improve in the second half of the season after the summer break.</p>

A dramatic fourth day saw England, chasing a record 374, reach 339-6 before rain and bad light stopped play. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late surge from India's bowlers shifted the momentum, creating a knife-edge scenario. The outcome of this single session of play will decide if England wins the series 3-1 or if India draws it 2-2.</p>

This trend is fueled by younger generations' preference for bold, adventurous flavors, often amplified through social media platforms like TikTok. While effective for short-term engagement, the challenge for restaurants lies in the fast-moving nature of these trends.</p>
