        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) is poised to win the most votes in Sunday's election, but is unlikely to secure a full majority. The AD is projected to receive between 29% and 34% of the vote, falling short of the 42% needed for an outright majority, which would potentially extend Portugal's period of political instability. The election, triggered by a failed confidence vote in March, addresses pressing issues such as housing and immigration amidst a decade of fragile governments. The far-right Chega party is expected to perform well, while the AD leader has ruled out forming a coalition with them.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return from the injured list. Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year, $60-million contract, had experienced declining production in recent seasons. The emergence of rookie Hyeseong Kim as a versatile and productive alternative contributed to the decision. The move signifies a shift within the Dodgers' clubhouse, marking the departure of another familiar face from their recent successful teams.</p>
