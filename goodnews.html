          <p>President Donald Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House to discuss a proposed 21-point plan aimed at ending the nearly two-year war in Gaza. Trump expressed high confidence in reaching a deal, which reportedly includes a ceasefire, the release of Hamas-held hostages, and an Israeli army withdrawal, with Hamas excluded from Gaza's future administration. The meeting occurs amid ongoing Israeli strikes in Gaza and international pressure for a resolution. The article also notes separate regional events, including Iran executing a man accused of spying for Israel.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Common Mistakes to Avoid When Repaying Debt</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five key behaviors to avoid when trying to pay off personal debt, emphasizing that the right strategy is as crucial as the amount paid. It warns against using predatory debt-relief services, tapping into retirement funds like a 401(k), and focusing solely on large debts while ignoring smaller ones. The piece also cautions against over-reliance on balance transfer cards without a clear payoff plan and highlights the critical mistake of neglecting to build an emergency fund. Following this guidance can help create a more stable and sustainable path to becoming debt-free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Education Secretary, Bridget Phillipson, announced that maintenance grants for university students from lower-income families will be reintroduced by 2029. The grants, which do not need to be repaid, will be targeted at tens of thousands of students enrolled in priority courses aligned with the government's industrial strategy. This initiative will be funded by a new tax on international student fees at English higher education institutions. The move comes after grants were abolished a decade ago and amid growing concerns over the rising cost of living for students.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Imelda Forecast to Become Hurricane While Moving Away from U.S. Coast</h2>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane but is expected to move away from the southeastern United States. Currently located near the northwestern Bahamas, the storm is bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the region. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Imelda will turn east-northeastward into the Atlantic, approaching Bermuda by mid-week. While a direct U.S. landfall is not anticipated, swells from Imelda, combined with those from Hurricane Humberto, are likely to cause dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has officially listed the Bishnoi gang, a criminal organization primarily operating out of India, as a terrorist entity. This designation allows authorities to freeze the group's assets and prosecute offenses such as financing and recruitment within Canada. The move follows allegations that the gang has been used to commit violent acts and intimidate diaspora communities, including targeting supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement. The action comes as Canada and India work to repair diplomatic relations strained by the 2023 killing of a Sikh separatist leader in British Columbia.</p>

          <p>Moldova's ruling pro-European Action and Solidarity (PAS) party has won a clear victory in the country's parliamentary election, securing over 50% of the vote and retaining its absolute majority. The result is seen as a significant defeat for Russia's influence in the region, as the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc received a much lower-than-expected 24% of the vote. PAS leader Igor Grosu celebrated the outcome as a win for the Moldovan people against foreign interference. This election follows a presidential victory for the pro-European incumbent and a referendum supporting EU membership.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young Americans are opting for careers in the skilled trades, such as electricians and plumbers, over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over high tuition costs, student loan debt, and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar jobs. Many in Gen Z view trades as offering greater job security, as they are difficult to automate. This trend marks a change in perception, where blue-collar work is increasingly seen as a viable and respectable path to financial independence and entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>Bernd das Brot, a perpetually gloomy loaf of bread character from German children's television, has become an unlikely viral star in the U.S. after being featured on John Oliver's show "Last Week Tonight." For 25 years, Bernd has been known in Germany for his deadpan humor and desire for peace and quiet, serving as an anti-hero in a typically cheerful TV landscape. American audiences have embraced the character, described as a "depressed German loaf of bread," for his embodiment of a humorless, complaining stereotype. His cult status highlights a cross-cultural appreciation for his unique, melancholic comedy.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military journal has provided new details on the Liaoyuan-1 (LY-1) shipborne laser weapon, which was unveiled at a recent military parade in Beijing. According to the publication, the LY-1 is designed to serve as a 'last line of defence' for naval vessels, tasked with intercepting close-range threats like incoming missiles and drones. The article asserts that the Chinese system's power output and overall structure, including a significantly larger lens aperture, are more advanced than comparable American laser weapons such as the Helios. It is expected to complement existing naval air-defence missile systems.</p>
