          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant increase after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Coinbase shares also saw a rise, as the company earns revenue from interest on Circle's USDC reserves. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use. The GENIUS Act aims to enhance consumer protections and promote the use of blockchains for dollar transactions, which could lead to broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Optimism is building around the potential for regulatory clarity and innovation in the stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan aimed at significantly reducing drug review times, potentially to as little as one to two months, for companies supporting U.S. national interests. This initiative is designed to accelerate the availability of cures and treatments to the American public by allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results are available. The FDA plans to grant a limited number of vouchers to companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While analysts see the plan as positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the potential risks of expedited reviews and political influence. The new program aims to address inefficiencies and encourage domestic drug manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eutelsat, the European satellite operator, surged after announcing a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state. The capital increase, along with a debt refinancing plan, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities for business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited. Eutelsat's shares have experienced volatility this year, with a spike in March due to expectations of being a European alternative to Starlink, highlighting the competitive landscape in the satellite industry.</p>

          <p>British lawmakers in the House of Commons have passed a bill allowing terminally ill adults in England and Wales to choose to end their lives, subject to a series of safeguarding checks. The bill, which now moves to the House of Lords for further scrutiny, would permit adults with less than six months to live to receive assistance in ending their lives. Supporters argue for the right to choose, while opponents express concerns about potential manipulation of vulnerable individuals. The vote represents a significant step towards changing social policy in the U.K., potentially mirroring the impact of the partial legalization of abortion in 1967.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold having surged recently, investors may be overlooking the potential benefits of silver, which has also seen a significant price increase. Silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce since January, marking a 28% increase in just over six months, driven by industrial demand. While silver may not necessarily be a "better" investment than gold, it can be more attractive for certain investors due to its lower entry price point and its ability to hedge against inflation and diversify portfolios. The article suggests that silver is worth a second look as an affordable alternative to gold for investors seeking to protect their investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The draft law legalizing assisted dying in some circumstances in England and Wales has cleared its initial stages in the House of Commons. The bill must now go through all the stages it went through in the Commons in the House of Lords, and then MPs will get a final say when they have looked at any changes suggested by peers. One of the biggest worries, for supporters of assisted dying, is that the Bill could run out of time, and it is also possible that too much disagreement could stop it. If all goes well, the first legal assisted deaths could be in 2029 or 2030.</p>

          <p>Today's vote is hugely significant, and it now looks highly likely that assisted dying will be introduced in England and Wales. The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing the same line-by-line scrutiny that it did before MPs. The government has said it could take up to four years to set up an assisted dying service, meaning it could be 2029 or even 2030 before the first medically-assisted death happens. Under the proposals, mentally competent, terminally ill adults in England and Wales with a life expectancy of less than six months would be eligible for an assisted death.</p>

The shake-up will see formulas that affect how billions of pounds are allocated to authorities updated for the first time in over a decade. Labour ministers argue the current system is failing to properly reflect higher demand for council services in poorer areas. But rural councils have raised concerns about the new plans, warning they could lose out to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds.</p>

The Fed subjects U.S. banks with at least $100 billion in assets to the annual year exercise, which simulates severe economic downturns to assess how well firms can withstand financial shocks and how much additional capital each must hold to avoid insolvency.
