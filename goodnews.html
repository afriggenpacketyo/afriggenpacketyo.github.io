          <h2>Trump Claims Victory After Iran Ceasefire, Cites Rutte's Praise</h2>

          <p>President Trump shared a congratulatory message from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte regarding the US military action in Iran, which Trump claims led to a ceasefire. Rutte praised Trump's "decisive action" in attacking Iran's nuclear facilities, stating it was something no one else dared to do, also noting NATO's commitment to increasing defense spending. Despite the administration's claims of obliterating Iran's nuclear research facilities, US military intelligence suggests the damage may only set the program back by months, and questions remain about Iran's enriched uranium supply. While a fragile ceasefire is in place, the long-term stability of the region remains uncertain, and other conflicts inherited by Trump continue. The article notes JD Vance's take on what he calls the three parts of Trump's "foreign policy doctrine".</p>

The vote to table the measure, a procedural mechanism to avoid directly voting on the bill, was 344-79. The Fox News Politics newsletter also covers other topics, including the near collapse of Trump's Israel-Iran ceasefire, Jasmine Crockett dropping out of a race, and the Senate preparing for a showdown over a "Big, Beautiful Bill".

          <p>Bitcoin's price increased following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside the unveiling of a major crypto bill in the Senate. The bill aims to define crypto as either a commodity or a security, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) regulation of digital assets. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev believes this regulatory development could help the US regain its lead in the crypto industry. Additionally, investors increased their bets on crypto company Digital Asset, signaling growing interest from major financial institutions in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people across multiple cities, citing a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity. The decision follows pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased, targeting Latino criminal organizations while overlooking white supremacist gangs. Gang injunctions are civil court orders that restrict suspected gang members from certain activities and associations within designated areas. Civil rights groups have long challenged the injunctions as overly broad and draconian, particularly as gang violence has declined.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission. This move is described as "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." The jets can also carry conventional weapons and will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. The use of nuclear weapons would require authorization from NATO's nuclear planning group, as well as the US president and British prime minister. This decision has been praised by NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte as a "robust British contribution to Nato."</p>

The ruling follows a previous appellate court decision that deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard, but it does not address the claim that troops are violating the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
