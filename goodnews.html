          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has rejected the Trump administration's attempt to enforce a policy preventing transgender and nonbinary individuals from obtaining passports that reflect their gender identity. The court upheld a lower court's injunction, which found the policy to be arbitrary and rooted in "unconstitutional animus" toward transgender Americans. The policy, part of a broader executive order recognizing only biological sex at birth, had reversed the previous allowance for an "X" gender marker. This ruling affirms that the government failed to justify the immediate and irreparable harm the policy would cause.</p>

The event, which Elon Musk was invited to but did not attend, aimed to foster closer ties between the administration and Silicon Valley. During the dinner, Gates spoke about advancements in vaccine technology, prompting Trump to defend Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "different take" on the subject. The gathering highlights the administration's efforts to encourage U.S. investment from major tech firms.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's central Hunan province are exploring a new application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve persistent payment defaults. The plan involves using the digital yuan to clear "chain debts," where funds could be programmed to reach the final creditor directly. Analysts suggest this could leverage the currency's traceability to make complex payment relationships more transparent and enhance real-time control over transactions. This potential use case would significantly expand the scope of the e-CNY beyond its current retail payment trials. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lakeside High School in DeKalb County, Georgia, is seeing positive results from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Teachers report that since the ban was implemented, students are more engaged in the classroom and that it is no longer a "losing battle" for their attention. The school's principal, Susan Stoddard, noted that student conduct has improved across the board, with a significant decrease in disciplinary issues. The local initiative is stricter than a new statewide Georgia law and reflects a growing national trend of regulating phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing postwar security guarantees for Ukraine, which could include an international force on land, sea, and air. The pledge was made following a summit where European leaders sought to secure President Trump's commitment to Kyiv's long-term security. The "reassurance force" would not be deployed on the front line but would aim to prevent future aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the announcement as a "serious concrete step," while the U.S. is expected to finalize its contributions in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered among his personal archives, which are being donated to the V&A Museum. The notes, found locked in his private study after his death in 2016, reveal his fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London. The project was a secret even to his closest collaborators and would have fulfilled a lifelong ambition to write for the theater. These materials offer a new window into the iconic artist's creative process and wide-ranging intellectual curiosity.</p>

This generation, many of whom started their careers remotely during the pandemic, are reportedly coming into the office more frequently than their older colleagues. This has led to new trends, including blurring the lines between personal and professional life, embracing AI as a productivity tool, and normalizing open conversations about well-being. They are seeking more intentional networking opportunities to compensate for the absence of senior staff.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his first-degree murder conviction was vacated, having spent nearly 27 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has since confessed to the murder herself. In addition, jailhouse informants who had implicated Hooper have long since recanted their testimony. The Hennepin County Attorney's office supported his release, stating it is their duty to "make things right as quickly as we can" when mistakes are made.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, expressed skepticism about the rapid adoption of agentic AI browsers in corporate environments. In an interview, he argued that unless these autonomous AI agents have robust security controls built around enterprise credentials, companies will not permit their use due to security risks. While Arora sees the consumer appeal of an AI that can autonomously book flights or make reservations, he believes they are "at odds with the enterprise." He highlighted the importance of identity security, noting that most breaches occur from credential theft.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the blockbuster trade of star defensive end Micah Parsons was a strategic financial decision based on "simple math." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking $186 million contract with the Green Bay Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the salary cap space saved by not paying Parsons' massive contract, combined with the value of the draft picks received, allows the team to afford multiple top-tier players. He emphasized the move was not personal but a calculated choice to spread resources.</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock rose in extended trading after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter earnings and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter. A key driver of investor optimism was the announcement of a $10 billion order for its custom AI chips from a new, unnamed fourth customer. The company's AI-related revenue jumped 63% to $5.2 billion during the period, and CEO Hock Tan projected it would reach $6.2 billion in the next quarter.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a maximum temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes as climate change increases the frequency of deadly heat waves. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, particularly for vulnerable populations, as sustained indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths. The Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles opposes the measure, citing concerns about increased costs.</p>
