          <p>A career expert and executive coach outlines five key strategies for effectively dealing with a controlling or micromanaging boss. These tactics include submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority to make them feel in control, and oversharing information to preemptively satisfy their need for oversight. The article also suggests getting ahead of criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." technique to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. Finally, it advises directly asking for positive feedback to foster a more balanced professional relationship.</p>

Borthwick highlighted the 23-year-old's power, versatility, and clean technique in winning turnovers without conceding penalties. Ilione's inclusion comes as England turns its focus away from Tom Willis, who will become ineligible for selection after his announced move to a French club. Borthwick stated he is investing training time in players who will be available for the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police has announced a policy change to no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, aiming to free up officer resources to focus on actual criminal matters. The decision was revealed as the Met dropped its probe into "Father Ted" creator Graham Linehan, who was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence through social media posts. The new policy is intended to provide clearer direction for officers and reduce ambiguity in policing online debates. A non-crime hate incident is an act perceived as motivated by prejudice but does not meet the threshold of a criminal offense.</p>

          <h2>'No Kings' Protests Demonstrate a New Form of Jubilant Political Opposition</h2>

          <p>Millions of people participated in the nationwide "No Kings" demonstrations, countering Republican predictions of violence with a largely peaceful and even cheerful tone of opposition to the Trump administration. The article suggests the protests, marked by irreverent humor and a diverse coalition of participants, may signify a new political posture for the American left and center. Despite the varied ideologies present, the unifying principle appeared to be a desire to restore liberal-democratic norms. The lack of violence at the massive rallies seemed to disappoint President Trump, who responded with a petulant social media post.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition in Los Angeles, titled "Monuments," features 18 decommissioned Confederate statues, including a melted-down bronze monument of General Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville. The show aims to confront the historical narrative of the Confederacy, which curators argue was rooted in the defense of slavery and white supremacy. The exhibition juxtaposes the controversial monuments with contemporary art pieces to reframe their meaning. This artistic reuse of the statues comes as President Donald Trump has ordered the reinstallation of similar monuments, highlighting the ongoing national debate over American history.</p>

          <h2>European Studies Suggest Cannabis Is More Effective Than Opioids for Back Pain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 12:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two major European clinical trials have found that a proprietary cannabis oil blend provides more effective relief for chronic low back pain compared to both a placebo and opioids. The research, published in Nature Medicine, showed that patients using the cannabis tincture experienced better pain relief and sleep, with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than those on opioids. While these findings are considered groundbreaking, the specific full-spectrum cannabis oil, VER-01, is not yet approved in the U.S. The studies provide new evidence for patients and doctors considering cannabis as an alternative for pain management.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing significant challenges from tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions, the U.S. automotive industry has proven more resilient than many analysts initially predicted for 2025. While costs have risen, factors like regulatory changes and stable consumer spending have helped offset some of the negative impacts. S&P Global recently revised its U.S. light vehicle sales estimates upward, though it noted that demand headwinds and economic uncertainty persist. The industry is navigating a delicate balance, with automakers like GM and Ford expected to report lower but still profitable third-quarter earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs surged after the company announced it is exploring rare earth mineral mining at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The move aligns with a broader U.S. strategy to establish domestic supply chains for critical minerals, reducing reliance on China, which currently dominates the global market. The announcement comes amid escalating trade tensions and new Chinese export controls, prompting increased investor interest in American rare earth companies. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated the company intends to be part of the solution for American manufacturing's mineral independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With Medicare's open enrollment period underway, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully review their health insurance options for the upcoming year. Experts advise against a "set-it-and-forget-it" approach, as plan coverage for doctors and prescription drugs can change, impacting out-of-pocket costs. One author suggests waiting to finalize decisions until the current federal government shutdown ends to ensure full access to information and support services. Beneficiaries can switch between original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans or change their Part D prescription drug coverage until December 7.</p>

The 36-year-old German signed a two-and-a-half-year deal, stating he is ready to embrace the "huge expectations" of the club and its fans. The appointment follows the sacking of Russell Martin and unproductive talks with other candidates, including former manager Steven Gerrard. Rangers currently sit sixth in the league, and the club's chairman expressed confidence that Rohl can "restore pride and ultimately success."</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry has approved the over-the-counter sale of an emergency contraceptive pill, a landmark decision for women's reproductive health in the country. The "morning-after" pill, marketed as Norlevo, will be available without a doctor's prescription, though it must be taken in the presence of a pharmacist. This move brings Japan in line with over 90 other countries and follows years of debate and campaigning by rights groups. Previously, the prescription requirement was criticized for creating barriers for women seeking to prevent unwanted pregnancies.</p>
