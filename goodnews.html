          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C in central England for a second consecutive day. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. While temperatures are record-breaking for 2025, they remain below the June peak of 35.6C recorded in 1976. Some relief is anticipated on Sunday as temperatures are expected to cool down slightly.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party has urged local governments to carefully implement strictures on lavish banquets, amid concerns from the food and beverage industry. The party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, stated that the frugality measures are intended to limit extravagance, not ordinary dining. Some local governments have been scrutinizing every meal gathering and canceling official receptions, causing unnecessary shocks to the catering industry. The curbs on excessive official meals were introduced after the release of regulations on thrift and waste in party and government bodies, banning high-end dishes, cigarettes, and liquor at official events.</p>

Early detection and treatment, ideally before the age of seven, are crucial for correcting the condition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can more than double the shelf life of fruits by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating has been tested on 17 varieties of fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. This strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The coating costs just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, making it an economically viable option.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in her retrial. Jurors, after four days of deliberation, acquitted Read of the most serious charges, though she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The defense argued that Read was framed and that O'Keefe was involved in a fight inside another person's home. Read's first trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury.</p>
