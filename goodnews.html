          <p>Pakistan intends to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The Pakistani government stated that Trump demonstrated strategic foresight and statesmanship through diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, de-escalating a rapidly deteriorating situation. Trump has claimed that he used trade as leverage to facilitate the ceasefire, a claim corroborated by Pakistan but denied by India. Some Pakistani officials support the nomination as a way to pander to Trump's ego, while others criticize it due to his stance on Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, dubbed "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from the patient undergoing routine tests. The woman is the only known carrier of this blood type, making her compatible only with herself. Scientists were able to identify the genetic mutation through high-throughput DNA sequencing and are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group.</p>

          <p>This week's market activity was influenced by geopolitical tensions, particularly the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, and the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate decision. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets such as oil, in response to the conflict. The Federal Reserve maintained its benchmark lending rate and revised economic projections, and is expected to cut rates later this year. The article emphasizes the importance of focusing on individual company fundamentals and industry trends rather than higher-level dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>
