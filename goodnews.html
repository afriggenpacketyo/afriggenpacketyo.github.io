          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump spoke via telephone, agreeing that upcoming bilateral tariff talks at the ministerial level should be productive.

The program includes a six-week course and allows veterans to keep the horses, aiming to combat PTSD, depression, and anxiety prevalent among veterans.</p>

          <p>A man in Norway woke up to find a large container ship had run aground and crashed into his front garden, missing his house by only meters. The 135-meter ship, the NCL Salten, went off course in Byneset, near Trondheim, with 16 people on board. No one was injured, and Norwegian police are investigating the incident. The ship had previously run aground in 2023 but got free under its own power.</p>
