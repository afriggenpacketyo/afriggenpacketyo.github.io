          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system, and the country's fertility rate is estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the replacement level. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare primarily on women.</p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will retire its original emoji set after 26 years, marking the end of an era for the visual language of digital communications. The Docomo emoji were introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service and gained popularity in Japan before spreading globally. The company cited the widespread adoption of Google's emoji as the reason for the decision, and new mobile phones will adopt Noto Color Emoji by Google or Samsung emoji instead. The Docomo emoji set was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>

Some venture capitalists have suggested that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally, but many founders disagree. They argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and that Europe's startup ecosystem needs more funding and resources instead. The youngest generation of workers also prioritize work-life balance and are less likely to tolerate toxic hustle cultures.</p>
