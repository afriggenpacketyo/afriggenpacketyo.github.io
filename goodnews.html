          <h2>House Republicans Unveil Tax Bill with Temporary Trump-Era Cuts and New Business Breaks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 20:18:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have presented their tax bill, aiming to extend several provisions from the 2017 Trump tax law, including lower income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, which are set to expire at the end of the year. The bill also introduces new temporary tax breaks, such as exemptions for tips, overtime pay, and a $4,000 bonus deduction for older Americans, while raising the state and local tax deduction limit to $30,000. To offset the costs, the legislation proposes tax increases on clean energy subsidies, university endowments, and remittances sent overseas, expected to add $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The bill faces opposition from some Republicans who seek a higher state and local tax deduction cap, signaling challenges in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>A museum dedicated to Oskar Schindler and the Jews he saved during World War II has opened at a former textile factory in Brnƒõnec, Czech Republic, marking the 80th anniversary of the war's end. The site, once stolen by the Nazis and turned into a concentration camp, now houses the Museum of Survivors, displaying the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, and the L√∂w-Beer family, who originally owned the plant. The museum features testimonies of Holocaust survivors and aims to be a universal place for sharing survivor stories and promoting education. While the museum is currently focused on educational activities for schools, plans are underway to fully restore the remaining buildings, including Schindler's office and the barracks where the Jewish prisoners lived and worked.</p>

          <p>Nicole Eggert discussed her experience on "Baywatch," noting that the show brought both fame and challenges, including negative press and typecasting. She said that the "Baywatch" stigma made it harder for people to get to know her beyond preconceived notions, affecting her dating life. Eggert also revealed that she had some crazy idea in her head that if she left the show, I would be able to detach myself from the stigma that the show had given all of us as actors, which is not a thing. She also spoke about the pressures of maintaining a certain image and her regrets about getting breast implants at a young age.</p>

          <p>Samsung has launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, a thin version of its flagship smartphone, in an unusually timed release, just four months after the S25 series launch. The device is 5.8 millimeters thin and weighs 163 grams, making it one of the thinnest smartphones on the market, and will start at $1,099. This move highlights Samsung's strategy to capitalize on the success of the S25 range amid rising competition and macroeconomic uncertainty. The launch also comes as the U.S. and China agreed to pause most of their tariffs on each party, which could impact smartphone demand in the coming months.</p>

          <p>President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, solidifying Ciattarelli's odds in the upcoming Republican primary. The endorsement could prove to be a liability, however, in November's general election. Ciattarelli had previously avoided appearing overtly aligned with Mr. Trump, but has openly courted the president since Mr. Trump's stronger-than-expected-showing in New Jersey November. The endorsement came less than about an hour before a debate among five of the six prominent Democrats vying for the nomination.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority has lifted a ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January over accusations of inciting sedition and interfering in internal Palestinian affairs. The authority offered scant information about why it issued the ban in January, and it maintained that stance in announcing that it was rescinding it. The ban had been indefinite, lasting until Al Jazeera, which is funded by Qatar, "corrected its legal status," though they did not detail the accusations against the broadcaster. Al Jazeera's bureau chief in Ramallah said the broadcaster's offices there would not be immediately reopened because they had also been shut by Israeli military order.</p>
