          <p>Following deadly floods in Texas, a massive volunteer effort has enabled Camp Camp, a facility for children and adults with disabilities, to reopen. The camp, located 30 miles downstream from another camp where 27 people died, suffered extensive damage from the Guadalupe River. A social media plea for help resulted in hundreds of volunteers arriving with supplies and machinery to clear debris and rebuild. This community-driven cleanup allowed the camp to welcome its visitors, providing a vital space of freedom and celebration for its attendees.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman named Jennifer Frederick, who believed she had a simple pulled muscle from working out, received a shocking diagnosis of metastatic malignant melanoma. The cancer, which is the deadliest form of skin cancer, had already spread to her lungs and brain without presenting typical symptoms like a new mole. She underwent an aggressive treatment regimen combining radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has shown remarkable success. Her story highlights the unusual ways melanoma can manifest and the significant recent advancements in cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has enabled China to dramatically expand its economic and military influence across Africa. Since the forum's inception in 2000, trade has increased nearly thirty-fold, and Chinese investment has grown by a factor of almost one hundred. This strategic partnership has also deepened security ties, with China now training thousands of African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent. This growth has allowed Beijing to surpass the influence of traditional powers like the U.S., Russia, and France in many regions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has passed the nation's first significant cryptocurrency legislation, which has now been signed into law, signaling a major shift in the government's approach to digital assets. The GENIUS Act establishes new regulations for stablecoins, aiming to integrate them more formally into the financial system. While supporters hail it as a step toward cementing American dominance in financial technology, critics worry the new rules are too weak and could expose consumers and the economy to significant risks.

          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities Marie Curie and Hospice UK are calling for all local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months to live from paying council tax. This campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a policy. Advocates argue that this measure would provide significant financial and mental relief to individuals facing immense stress and additional costs for energy and medical care. It represents a compassionate step to ease the burden during the most challenging of times.</p>

          <p>A customized artificial intelligence model is playing a key role in the effort to reintroduce the threatened California red-legged frog to its historic range in Southern California. After years of translocating egg masses from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists were unsure if the frogs were successfully breeding. By deploying microphones and using AI to sift through thousands of hours of audio, researchers were able to detect the frogs' distinct mating calls. This technological assistance confirmed successful breeding, marking a major milestone in the fight against a worsening extinction crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that for Democrats to regain support from non-college-educated voters, they must change their campaign messaging. The author contends that focusing on "assaults on democracy" is less effective than addressing kitchen-table economic issues, which polls show are a higher priority for this demographic. The piece suggests Democrats should highlight how the Trump administration's policies, such as tariffs and budget cuts, negatively impact ordinary Americans while benefiting corporations, and frame his foreign policy as weakening the nation.</p>

          <p>The market for snacks labeled as "high-protein" is booming, but experts advise consumers to be discerning. While protein is an essential nutrient for bodily functions, many products use the claim as a marketing tool while containing high amounts of sugar and processed ingredients. Nutritionists suggest a simple calculation to assess a snack's value: a food high in protein should derive 30% or more of its total calories from protein. They also recommend prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, and cottage cheese to meet protein needs without consuming excessive sugar or additives.</p>
