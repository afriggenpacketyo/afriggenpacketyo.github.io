          <p>Amid a July slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to bolster their roster before the trade deadline, with a focus on upgrading their outfield defense. While the team's superstar-laden offense has struggled, preventing runs is seen as a key to a potential title run, making defensive prowess a priority. Minnesota Twins outfielder Harrison Bader, a premium defender also having a strong offensive season, has emerged as a potential target. The move would address defensive weaknesses and complement the team's strong starting pitching as they prepare for the postseason.</p>

          <p>Deion "Coach Prime" Sanders, head football coach for the Colorado Buffaloes, announced he was diagnosed with bladder cancer and recently underwent surgery to remove his bladder. At a press conference with his medical team, his doctor confirmed the tumor was high-grade but that Sanders is now considered cancer-free. The two-time Super Bowl champion became emotional while discussing his journey but confirmed he will continue coaching. He used the announcement to urge others, particularly African-American men, to get regular health checkups to enable early detection.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) is set to begin its 2025 Leagues Cup run facing a demanding schedule, with three matches in a single week. Coach Steve Cherundolo has expressed concerns about player fatigue due to the packed calendar, which includes MLS games and the Club World Cup. This year's tournament features a new format with separate tables for MLS and Liga MX teams to ensure parity in the knockout stages. Despite the physical toll, LAFC aims to leverage its experience against Mexican clubs and improve upon its past performances in the competition.</p>

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm to strengthen to Category 2 intensity before gradually weakening later in the week. The hurricane is projected to continue moving westward, staying well south of Hawaii, marking a notable development in the 2025 hurricane season.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority is surveying its airlines about their future needs for Boeing aircraft, a move that suggests a potential thaw in trade relations with the U.S. The regulator specifically asked carriers about their plans for overdue Boeing orders and future fleet renewals. This development, along with a recent high-level meeting between the agency's director and a Boeing senior vice president, indicates that the American aerospace company could benefit significantly if a broader trade deal between Beijing and Washington is reached. The survey signals a possible increase in orders for Boeing jets from the crucial Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers star Luka Doncic has undergone a significant physical transformation during the offseason, adopting a new gluten-free, low-sugar diet and a rigorous daily workout regimen in his home country of Croatia.

Now visibly slimmer and more toned, Doncic says he feels his "whole body looks better" and views this summer as just the beginning of a long-term commitment to his fitness.

          <p>A Palestinian family seeking to flee the conflict in Gaza has won a key legal victory against the UK government. The High Court ruled that the foreign secretary must "think again" about whether to help the family of six, who have a British relative and are living in a tent at "constant risk." The family was granted permission to come to the UK but was denied assistance in leaving Gaza, as the Foreign Office's policy for such help is highly restrictive. The judge found the family's situation to be legally exceptional, compelling the government to reconsider its decision.</p>
