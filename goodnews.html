          <h2>German Chancellor Vote Fails in First Round, Friedrich Merz Seeks Majority</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 07:08:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, a centrist coalition candidate, failed to secure a majority in the first round of voting for German Chancellor in the Bundestag, receiving only 310 votes out of the needed 316. The secret ballot process, designed to ensure lawmakers' freedom, raised questions about potential dissent within his own coalition, comprised of the CDU, CSU, and SPD, which collectively hold 328 seats. Despite a mock ballot suggesting Merz's confirmation, the outcome underscores the unpredictability of secret votes, contrasting with the open voting on specific laws. The vote's outcome casts doubt on Merz's ability to lead Germany amid economic and security challenges, especially given the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is being asked to rule on a case involving a Maine lawmaker, Laurel Libby, who was censured for criticizing a transgender athlete on Facebook. After Libby refused to remove the post, she was stripped of her ability to vote in the House, leading to a legal challenge arguing that this violates the First Amendment and punishes her constituents. While the Maine House has a right to express its views, the case raises concerns about lawmakers silencing dissent by stripping colleagues of their voting rights. The Supreme Court's decision in Bond v. Floyd supports the idea that legislators should have wide latitude to express their views, suggesting that the same rule should apply in Libby v. Fecteau.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a sharp decline after a historic surge, prompting officials to deny allegations of currency manipulation in trade talks with the U.S. The currency weakened by over 3% against the U.S. dollar following a 9% rally, driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. Despite the pullback, the Taiwan dollar remains significantly up for the year, and analysts are closely monitoring the central bank's actions amid speculation of a currency realignment. While officials deny intervention, some believe exchange rates might be part of broader U.S.-Taiwan trade discussions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 06:45:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China has reportedly made limited efforts to de-dollarise its economy, as indicated by an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, making a rapid diversification away from the U.S. currency impractical. Instead of selling U.S. assets, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support exporters, rendering a disruptive sale of U.S. Treasury holdings unlikely. This strategy allows exporters to purchase more of the Chinese currency with U.S. dollars earned from overseas sales.</p>

Morgan insisted this stance does not signify a split but represents "grown up modern government," stressing that Wales will stand up against perceived unfairness. She emphasized the need to change the Barnett formula, which determines how Wales is funded, to better reflect the country's needs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While inflation remains above target levels, some sectors of the U.S. economy have seen recent price declines, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Experts attribute these deflations to idiosyncratic factors and supply-and-demand dynamics, but warn that tariffs threaten to reverse this trend. For example, gasoline prices are down almost 10% from a year ago, while television and smartphone prices have fallen significantly due to improved production efficiency. However, economists caution that these lower prices may not last, citing potential disruptions from tariffs and other economic factors.</p>
