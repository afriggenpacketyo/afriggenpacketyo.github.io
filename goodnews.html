The judges scored the fight 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92 in favor of Paul, who improved his professional record to 12-1.

The French state recently became the largest shareholder with a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion investment, positioning Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the near term, citing Starlink's vastly larger satellite constellation and launch capabilities. Eutelsat is seen as better positioned to serve security-sensitive government and enterprise markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a small island group administered by Taipei but located just miles from mainland China, serves as a unique case study in the cross-strait relationship. Once a heavily militarized front line, it has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems. An on-the-ground report from the island reveals the distinct limitations both Beijing and Taipei face in exerting their influence there. While Taipei still promotes it as a symbol of its governance, the island's unique position highlights the complex and often indirect nature of the power dynamics across the Taiwan Strait.</p>

Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss.

While the events maintain a celebratory atmosphere, organizers state this year's marches will adopt a more defiant and protest-oriented tone. This shift comes in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those targeting transgender individuals, and a notable decrease in corporate sponsorships for Pride events. The theme for New York's march is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," reflecting the community's current mood.</p>
