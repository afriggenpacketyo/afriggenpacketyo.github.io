          <h2>Ancient Chinese Wisdom Aids in Decoding Cell Life Cycles Through Yeast Metabolism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 00:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four distinct phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state and mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. The four phases‚Äî1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B‚Äîoverlap and transition sequentially, with specific molecular mechanisms triggering the next phase while suppressing others. This study redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, which is a model organism used in the study of molecular life mechanisms, and it also highlights the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate fields of knowledge.</p>

Other headlines focus on domestic issues such as the NHS sending patients abroad for treatment and the Home Office failing to collect millions from firms housing asylum seekers. Prince William's 43rd birthday and his environmental work are also highlighted. The newspapers went to print before President Trump confirmed the U.S. had struck nuclear sites in Iran, but the announcement was picked up by news websites.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets" to support the country's housing market amid declining prices and subdued buyer sentiment. These platforms, both online and offline, aim to make home buying more transparent and efficient.

These centrally managed platforms aim to improve transaction efficiency by consolidating information and bundling services, but the characteristics of the housing supermarkets vary by region.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband Bob in 2001 has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed some spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Jane continued to advocate for her innocence and sought to reexamine the evidence used to convict her. Despite her conviction being overturned, the case was dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces.</p>

Exports rose 7.3% year-on-year, while imports increased 4.9%, according to government data. The narrowing deficit provides some relief for the Japanese economy, which has been grappling with weak domestic demand and global economic uncertainty. The trade figures reflect the ongoing efforts to boost exports and reduce reliance on imports, but the overall economic outlook remains uncertain.</p>
