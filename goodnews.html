The platform aims to expand access to pre-IPO investments for retail investors, who typically face high minimum investment requirements. The company plans to offer tokens for other private companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Stripe, and investors can invest between $50 and $5,000 in the tokens. This move comes as the U.S. crypto industry experiences a more favorable regulatory environment under President Trump's administration, but the legality of the tokens and how Republic will provide financial information to investors remain open questions.

          <p>Public speaking consultant Bill McGowan, who has coached numerous celebrities and CEOs, identifies a common communication mistake: the overuse of corporate jargon. McGowan argues that using bland and boring words and phrases in an attempt to sound smart can confuse people and come across as inauthentic. He advises against writing speeches or presentations for the eye, which often includes longer, flowier phrases, and instead recommends writing for the ear, using language that is similar to how people talk in everyday conversation. By avoiding jargon and using clear, relatable language, individuals can connect more effectively with their audience.</p>
