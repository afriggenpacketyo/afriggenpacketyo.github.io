          <p>Bill Belichick revealed that he spent $5,000 on special milk for Tom Brady to keep the relationship between Brady and Antonio Brown positive during Brown's brief time with the New England Patriots. Brown had ordered the milk for Brady, who is very nutrition-oriented, but it spoiled after getting mixed up in the mailroom. To avoid ruining the relationship between the two players, Belichick approved the expense report for the milk. While Brown's tenure with the Patriots was short, he and Brady later won a Super Bowl together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, appeared to win the first round of Poland's presidential election, narrowly edging out Karol Nowrocki, backed by the hard-right Law and Justice party. With no candidate securing a majority, a runoff election is scheduled for June 1. The election is viewed as crucial, as the winner will replace Andrzej Duda, a conservative ally of Law and Justice, potentially impacting Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to implement his agenda. Trzaskowski is seeking to appeal to voters beyond urban areas and those in rural parts of the country.</p>
