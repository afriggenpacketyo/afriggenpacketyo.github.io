          <p>President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine completed a major prisoner exchange, suggesting it could lead to something significant regarding diplomatic efforts to end the conflict. A Ukrainian official confirmed the exchange was ongoing but not yet complete. The exchange, agreed upon during recent peace talks in Turkey, involves approximately 1,000 prisoners from each side. Trump previously stated he could end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours and held a phone call with Putin, describing the tone as "excellent", and held a separate call with Zelenskyy. </p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a rally after reports surfaced that President Trump plans to sign executive orders aimed at accelerating reactor construction and securing essential materials for the nuclear industry. Advanced reactor companies like Oklo and NuScale saw significant premarket gains, as did Constellation Energy, the largest nuclear operator in the U.S., and Cameco Corp., a major uranium miner. Trump is expected to invoke the Defense Production Act, declaring a national emergency due to U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study by Mynavi Career Research Lab found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with young employees most likely to admit to this behavior. This shift reflects a rejection of the older generations' dedication to companies at the expense of personal lives, with young people now seeking more "me time" and valuing a balanced lifestyle. The trend may also improve well-being and reduce 'karoshi', or death by overwork. </p>

          <p>With birth rates declining in the United States, some right-wing pronatalists advocate for policies that incentivize motherhood within traditional family structures. However, the feminist movement's 'Wages for Housework' campaign offered a different approach, advocating for government pay for all care work and communal social structures to support women's economic freedom. While never mainstream, the movement's ideas, as explored in Emily Callaci's book, challenge the devaluation of care work and propose a society where women have the economic means to pursue any life they choose, whether it involves motherhood or not. </p>

He indicated that the 5% target might be achievable in the long term if broader security-related expenses were included. NATO chief Mark Rutte has proposed that members increase defense spending to 3.5% of GDP and allocate an additional 1.5% to wider security matters. </p>
