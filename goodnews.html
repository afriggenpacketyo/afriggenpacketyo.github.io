          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defends the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's budget bill, asserting they have a "moral component" as those who "refuse" to work are "defrauding the system." Johnson claims the bill does not cut Medicaid or SNAP, but addresses fraud, waste, and abuse, requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week. However, critics like Senator Hawley argue the measures are "morally wrong and politically suicidal," potentially forcing low-income individuals to pay for medical visits.

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts to lower soaring prices, aiming to reach around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action follows criticism of the government's prior ineffectiveness in controlling rising rice prices. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the previous auction system. The new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, is leading the effort, emphasizing urgency and public expectation. Optimism score of 70.</p>
