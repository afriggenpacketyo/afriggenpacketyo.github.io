          <p>This New York Times article discusses how the Democratic Party is attempting to leverage parents' anxieties regarding rising prices of baby gear, the spread of vaccine misinformation, and cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, all of which are linked to President Trump's policies. The article suggests that Democrats see an opportunity to persuade voters that the Trump administration is negatively impacting their lives, particularly concerning issues like measles outbreaks and vaccine approaches. However, the article also acknowledges that Republicans have been more successful in tapping into parents' emotions in recent years, making it a challenging task for Democrats to connect with these voters effectively.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over relying solely on data and research in decision-making. Diller argues that data can be harmful to instinct and that too much information can obscure the essence of a good idea. He shares anecdotes from his career, including the making of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," to illustrate how trusting one's gut feeling can lead to success in the entertainment industry. Diller emphasizes that a good idea and common sense are crucial, even more so than structured information.</p>

          <p>Jockey Junior Alvarado, who rode Sovereignty to victory in the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and banned for overuse of the whip during the race. The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority (HISA) found that Alvarado used the whip eight times, exceeding the permitted amount of six strikes. This was his second such offense, resulting in a doubled fine and a two-day ban. Alvarado has the option to appeal the punishment, but Sovereignty will not compete in the upcoming Preakness Stakes.</p>
