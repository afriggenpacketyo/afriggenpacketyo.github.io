          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using tellurium, a rare mineral, which restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants created from tellurium convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, replacing damaged photoreceptor cells. This advancement offers potential treatments for human blindness, providing a new approach to restoring vision and enhancing visual capabilities.
