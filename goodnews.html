          <p>The latest global rhino census presents a mixed picture for the five remaining species, with some populations showing recovery while others face dire threats. The report indicates a positive growth in the numbers of critically endangered Black rhinos in Africa and greater one-horned rhinos in Asia, showcasing conservation successes. However, the situation is grim for Indonesia's Javan and Sumatran rhinos, whose populations are on the verge of extinction due to poaching and habitat loss. Additionally, the number of white rhinos in Africa has slightly decreased, primarily due to a concerning resurgence in poaching activities in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Brandon Russell, the founder of the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen Division, has been sentenced to the maximum of 20 years in federal prison for conspiring to attack Maryland's power grid. The plot, organized with his girlfriend, aimed to trigger societal collapse by targeting the energy infrastructure of the majority-Black city of Baltimore. During sentencing, the judge condemned Russell's white supremacist ideology, identifying him as the 'intellectual horsepower' behind the plan to create a racist utopia. This conviction follows a previous sentence for Russell related to the possession of explosive materials discovered during a homicide investigation.</p>

          <p>Shares in Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a record high following the announcement of better-than-expected first-quarter profits. The company reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a significant turnaround from a loss in the previous year, largely driven by a $4.8 billion increase in the value of its Vision Funds. This gain was attributed to the strong performance of both private and publicly listed portfolio companies, such as Grab and Swiggy. The positive results have boosted investor confidence, with several more of SoftBank's portfolio companies expected to go public soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered an increased presence of federal law enforcement agencies in Washington, D.C., to address a recent surge in violent crime. The operation, which involves agencies like the FBI and DEA, will focus on improving safety in high-traffic tourist areas and other known crime hotspots. A White House spokesperson stated that President Trump is committed to making the nation's capital safer for residents and visitors. This move follows the president's campaign promise to restore order and is part of an ongoing initiative established by the 'Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force' executive order.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has reached a settlement with Disney and Lucasfilm in her lawsuit over being fired from the 'Star Wars' series 'The Mandalorian' in 2021. Carano was dismissed after making controversial social media posts, including one comparing the political climate for Republicans to the persecution of Jews during the Holocaust. The actress, whose lawsuit for wrongful termination and discrimination was financially backed by Elon Musk, had sought damages and to be recast in the show. While the terms of the settlement are not public, Lucasfilm released a statement describing Carano as well-respected and looks forward to future work opportunities.</p>

          <p>The office of Vice President JD Vance has clarified that he was unaware of a Secret Service request to raise the water level of Ohio's Little Miami River for a family boating trip. A Guardian report revealed that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers increased the outflow from a lake to ensure safe navigation for the Vice President's security detail. The Secret Service later confirmed the decision was made independently during standard planning for operational reasons, after a safety boat ran aground during a scouting mission. The incident drew some public criticism and comparisons to a similar situation involving former Vice President Al Gore.</p>

          <p>For the first time ever, the Southern Small White butterfly, a species typically found in Southern Europe, has been officially sighted and confirmed in the United Kingdom. A volunteer at the Landguard Bird Observatory in Suffolk photographed the female butterfly, whose identity was verified by experts. This species has been rapidly expanding its range northward through Europe in recent decades, a movement believed to be at least partly driven by a warming climate. While its arrival is a significant event for British fauna, it is not yet known if the species will establish a breeding population.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's directive to exclude undocumented immigrants from the U.S. census, this article explains the complexities of the decennial count. The Constitution mandates a full enumeration of the population every 10 years to determine congressional representation, a massive undertaking that cannot be changed quickly. While the Trump administration's previous attempt to add a citizenship question was blocked by the Supreme Court, the legal door was not entirely closed. The article details how the census works, its long planning cycle, and the significant impact any changes would have on political power and resource allocation across the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is auctioning a $300 million superyacht, the Amadea, which was seized from a sanctioned Russian oligarch as part of efforts to pressure Russia over the war in Ukraine. The 348-foot vessel, currently docked in San Diego, features a helideck, a mosaic pool with a submerged bar, and a marble fireplace. The Justice Department maintains the ship was owned by Suleiman Kerimov, an oligarch sanctioned for money laundering and ties to Vladimir Putin. The sealed-bid auction, which requires a $10 million deposit, offers a rare opportunity to purchase an emblem of the lavish oligarch lifestyle.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are reportedly moving away from dating apps and embracing a more old-fashioned approach by attending in-person events. The article highlights the success of groups like Date Cincy, which hosts events for people seeking genuine face-to-face connections, free from the potential misrepresentation of online profiles. This trend coincides with a significant drop in the market value of apps like Bumble and a rise in attendance at singles events. For many, the chance to experience authentic, real-time chemistry is proving more appealing than swiping through digital profiles.</p>
