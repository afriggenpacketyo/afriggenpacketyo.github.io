          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5km away to protect it from ground subsidence caused by an adjacent iron ore mine. The massive 672-tonne structure was lifted onto giant trailers for the slow, two-day journey through the Arctic city, an event that drew large crowds of locals and tourists. This delicate operation is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city's center, which has been undermined by over a century of mining activity. The church's interior treasures, including a large altar painting and a 1,000-pipe organ, remain inside during the move, carefully stabilized for protection.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Washington, Western allies are considering the possibility of direct talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. US President Trump indicated he would help arrange such a meeting, while also pledging security guarantees for Ukraine, with European nations expected to bear much of the responsibility. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stressed the need for thorough preparations and a ceasefire, a sentiment echoed by other European leaders who remain cautious about Russia's willingness to negotiate in good faith. The discussions represent a significant diplomatic push to find a resolution to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>British singer Tom Grennan has revealed he is in therapy for body dysmorphia, a mental health condition where individuals obsess over perceived flaws in their appearance. Speaking on a BBC podcast, the 30-year-old artist described himself as his own "biggest critic," constantly feeling he is larger than he is and experiencing guilt after eating binges. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) can severely impact a person's life, leading to excessive worry and comparison with others. By sharing his experience, Grennan aims to raise awareness and emphasize how therapy is helping him to practice self-love and develop a healthier mindset.</p>

          <p>A new 'digital divide' is emerging in education as affluent schools are more likely to provide training and resources for artificial intelligence, leaving students in lower-income districts behind. To combat this disparity, a free summer camp at Princeton University called AI4All invites high schoolers from low-income families to learn the fundamentals of AI technology. The program aims to democratize AI education, ensuring that a diverse range of students have the skills to use and shape the future of this transformative technology. Participants work on real-world problems and gain exposure to a field they might not otherwise access, fostering a new generation of innovators from underrepresented backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Ashvir Singh Johal has made history by becoming the first Sikh to manage a professional British football club with his appointment at Morecambe FC. At 30 years old, he is also the youngest manager currently in the top five tiers of English football. The appointment follows the takeover of the National League club by the Panjab Warriors consortium.

          <p>The US Director of National Intelligence has announced that the United Kingdom has retracted its formal demand for Apple to create a "back door" to access encrypted user data globally. The UK government had issued a notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, which prompted Apple to challenge the order legally and withdraw its Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market. Privacy advocates have welcomed the reversal, which they had condemned as a reckless threat to personal and national security. While the immediate conflict appears resolved, concerns remain as the legal powers enabling such demands are still in place in the UK.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's Conservative Party, is projected to win a by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, securing his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre lost his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the last general election, which saw his party defeated by the Liberals. This special election was called after a fellow Conservative member of Parliament stepped aside to allow him to run in the safe conservative stronghold. The victory allows the 46-year-old leader to re-enter Parliament ahead of an autumn session and a mandatory party leadership review scheduled for January.</p>

          <p>The US Open has reimagined its mixed doubles competition, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek with a $1 million prize and a shorter format. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and draw more fan interest, with matches scheduled on the largest show courts. However, the new format has been criticized by many doubles specialists, such as Jamie Murray, who view it as a "glorified exhibition" that devalues a Grand Slam title. They argue it sidelines dedicated doubles players from a significant earning opportunity and was implemented without proper consultation with the player councils.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a plan to take a 10% equity stake in Intel, which would make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The proposal involves potentially converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS Act into equity. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the struggling American semiconductor company, which has fallen behind global competitors, and to build government-backed national champions in strategic industries. The discussions are still preliminary, but they follow SoftBank's recent $2 billion investment and highlight Washington's growing interest in securing the domestic chip supply chain.

          <p>Helsinki has become one of the largest cities to record zero traffic fatalities in the past year, a success attributed to a comprehensive road safety strategy. A key measure has been the reduction of speed limits to 30 km/h (about 19 mph) on more than half of the city's streets, particularly around schools. As part of the EU's "Vision Zero" initiative, the Finnish capital has also focused on redesigning infrastructure to prioritize pedestrian and cyclist safety, improving public transport, and using data to identify and eliminate accident blackspots. Enhanced speed enforcement, with 60 fixed cameras, has also been crucial in changing driver behavior and making the city's streets safer for everyone.</p>

The walkout, which began over the weekend, disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The union had previously defied two back-to-work orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, protesting the government's use of legislation that curtails the right to strike. The breakthrough came after a late-night negotiating session assisted by a mediator, allowing for the full resumption of the carrier's operations.</p>

The fundraising campaign received widespread support, including over 2,800 public donations and major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund.
