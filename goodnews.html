          <p>A Trump administration special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is scheduled to meet with Israeli and Qatari officials in Rome to further negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza. The talks are part of a significant U.S. effort to end the nearly two-year conflict. According to reports, if substantial progress is achieved, Witkoff may travel to Doha to finalize the agreement. The proposed deal is centered around a 60-day ceasefire that includes a phased hostage release and could pave the way for an expansion of the Abraham Accords.</p>

          <h2>Genetic Modification Shows Promise in Preventing Mosquitoes from Spreading Malaria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:02:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to render mosquitoes highly resistant to spreading malaria by making a single genetic tweak. Using gene-editing technology, scientists altered one amino acid in a mosquito's genome, which significantly disrupted the malaria parasite's ability to travel to the insect's salivary glands. This change, which could potentially be spread through a wild mosquito population using a gene drive, offers a promising new strategy in the fight against a disease that infects over 260 million people annually, though the technology remains controversial.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish during the 17th stage. The race concluded with a bunch finish after the peloton absorbed the last breakaway rider with just 4 kilometers remaining. Milan capitalized on a late crash that involved some of his main rivals, ultimately strengthening his hold on the green jersey for the points classification leader. Race leader Tadej Pogacar finished safely with the peloton, maintaining his significant overall lead in the general classification.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's Marcus Rashford has finalized a season-long loan to the La Liga club Barcelona, with the Spanish team having an option for a permanent signing in 2026. Barcelona will cover all of the 27-year-old England international's wages after he agreed to a pay cut. This move follows a difficult period for Rashford at Old Trafford, where his form declined and he faced disciplinary issues under multiple managers, leading to his eventual exclusion from the first team and a request to leave the club.</p>

The deal was met with relief in Japan, where markets surged, particularly auto stocks, as it avoids a previously threatened 25% tariff rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including for historical greenhouse gas emissions. The non-binding decision is a victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly low-lying Pacific islands, which brought the case out of frustration with the lack of global progress. The ruling paves the way for potential compensation claims against nations historically responsible for the most fossil fuel consumption, establishing new legal ground for climate justice.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the University of Florida have made a potential breakthrough in developing a universal cancer vaccine. In a study on mice, an experimental mRNA vaccine, designed to stimulate a general immune response rather than target specific cancer cells, significantly boosted the effectiveness of common immunotherapy drugs. The vaccine works by making tumors more vulnerable to attack from the immune system. If these promising results can be replicated in humans, it could lead to an off-the-shelf vaccine applicable to a wide range of cancer patients.</p>

It details common formulas, such as a flat percentage or a percentage plus interest, used by issuers to determine the required amount. The text strongly advises against paying only the minimum, as high interest rates cause debt to grow significantly over time. It suggests that paying more than the minimum is crucial for avoiding long-term debt and substantial interest charges. (not investment advice)</p>
