        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that lowering the recommended age for colorectal cancer screening to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses. The studies show a sharp rise in both screenings and localized cancer detection among people aged 45 to 49 since the guidelines were updated. Health experts call this promising news, as finding cancer earlier improves treatment outcomes and saves lives. However, they also note that screening rates in this younger age group remain suboptimal and require further effort to increase.</p>

          <p>Firefighters on Maui have been battling a brush fire above Ka'anapali, just a few miles north of where the catastrophic Lahaina wildfires occurred nearly two years ago. The blaze prompted the shutdown of a major highway as crews worked to control it, with the Maui County Fire Department reporting that the fire was slowly being contained. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the region's vulnerability to wildfires, which previously devastated the historic town of Lahaina, causing over 100 fatalities. Officials asked motorists to avoid the area due to heavy smoke.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born just before the Civil War, is finally being honored with a headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Despite his international renown and association with figures like Marcus Garvey, Bruce was not wealthy and was buried without a marker in 1924. A new effort, using private and public funds, has created a black granite headstone to preserve his legacy. Advocates say it is a fitting tribute for a man who dedicated his life to ensuring Black history and culture were acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been instructed to stop summarily deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy, which had effectively closed the asylum system to those crossing illegally, was found to violate U.S. laws protecting people from being returned to places where they could face persecution or torture. This move reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during the process. The administration had credited the ban for a record drop in illegal border crossings.</p>

          <p>Joshua Taylor, a Michigan man living with a genetic condition that affects his mobility, is leading a mission to make adult-sized changing tables more common in public spaces. He highlights that teenagers and adults with disabilities often have no choice but to be changed on unsanitary floors or in cars, a reality that discourages many from leaving home. By working with officials and the national organization Changing Spaces USA, Taylor is raising awareness about this essential need. He argues that providing these accessible facilities is not a convenience but a necessity for community inclusion.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's recent rebound is primarily due to the strong earnings reports from the seven largest technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Apple. He argued that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the market's resilience is rooted in the impressive performance and diverse revenue streams of these tech giants. Cramer highlighted specific successes, such as the growth in Microsoft's cloud division and the massive user engagement across Meta's platforms, as key factors bolstering investor confidence.

          <p>The United Kingdom is implementing stricter gun licensing laws, a change championed by Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held weapon in 2020. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications instead of one and mandate that police investigate signs of domestic abuse. Ambler began her campaign after her sister's partner, who had lied about his mental health history on his application, committed the murders. She expressed hope that the changes will prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.</p>

          <p>In a profound act of family love, Dr. Lisa Carchedi, a psychiatrist in Maryland, donated a kidney to her older sister, Gina Warsaw, who was suffering from kidney failure. The successful transplant was performed using a minimally invasive, single-port robotic technique at the University of Maryland Medical Center, which reduces scarring and recovery time. The sisters, who have always been close, scheduled the surgery on the anniversary of their father's death, honoring his belief that family comes first.

          <p>New guidance from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advises that patients coming off obesity jabs like Wegovy should receive structured support for at least a year. Since many people regain weight after stopping the medication, the advice emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process. The recommendations for the NHS encourage follow-up care focused on building sustainable healthy habits, including diet and exercise, to help patients maintain their weight loss.
