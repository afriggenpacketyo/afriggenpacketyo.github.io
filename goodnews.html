          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Prison in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a months-long manhunt. His arrest was the result of a coordinated multi-agency operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. The May 16 jailbreak, which occurred through a hole behind a toilet, was attributed by the sheriff to prison staffing shortages and significant design flaws in the facility. At least 16 other individuals, including a former jail employee, are facing charges for allegedly aiding the fugitives after their escape from the New Orleans jail.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud provider CoreWeave rose by as much as 8% after the company announced new tools designed to help developers create AI agents more efficiently. The new serverless reinforcement learning service automates the allocation of computing power, which the company claims can train models faster and at a 40% lower cost compared to using Nvidia H100 GPUs locally. This launch follows CoreWeave's recent billion-dollar acquisition of Weights and Biases and major spending commitments from clients like OpenAI and Meta. The company continues to expand its infrastructure to meet the high demand for AI computing resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major policy announcement, UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch declared that a future Tory government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of main homes. She framed the move as a way to unlock the housing market, improve social mobility, and help millions achieve homeownership. The tax would remain for additional properties, corporate purchases, and non-UK residents. The party estimates the policy would cost the Treasury £9 billion annually after 2029, which Badenoch stated would be funded by previously announced savings from cuts to welfare, foreign aid, and the Civil Service.</p>

The storm is currently moving parallel to Mexico's Baja California Sur coastline, bringing high surf and gusty winds to the region. The National Hurricane Center has a tropical storm watch in effect for the area and warns of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Forecasters expect Priscilla to continue weakening over the next 48 hours as it remains offshore in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, with more expected this year, rates on savings vehicles like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are declining from their recent highs. While the 6-7% rates of the past are gone, savers can still find competitive returns, particularly with short-term CDs offering rates above 4%. These rates remain significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, and locking one in now can protect earnings against future rate reductions. Experts suggest that savers should act quickly as rates have likely peaked and should compare offerings from online banks, which typically provide higher yields than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions.

          <p>Former Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard is set to hold discussions with the Scottish Premiership club Rangers about a potential return as their new head coach. The club is seeking a replacement for Russell Martin, who was sacked on Sunday. While Rangers had previously indicated openness to reappointing Gerrard, they were awaiting his confirmation of interest. Sources now suggest that talks will proceed in the coming days, though Gerrard is reportedly one of several candidates the club intends to interview as part of a thorough selection process to fill the managerial vacancy.</p>

          <p>Amazon Pharmacy is expanding its healthcare footprint by launching electronic kiosks in One Medical primary care offices, allowing patients to receive common medications immediately after their appointments. The rollout will begin in the Los Angeles area in December 2025, with plans for further expansion. These kiosks will stock non-refrigerated medications tailored to the prescribing patterns of each location, such as antibiotics and inhalers. This move represents a direct challenge to the integrated retail health-care model of competitors like CVS, as Amazon continues to leverage its Prime ecosystem to disrupt the pharmacy industry.

          <h2>Financial Advisor Argues Stocks Outperform Gold Long-Term Despite Record Highs for the Metal</h2>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, some financial advisors caution that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. Pat Beaird of Beaird Harris Wealth Management notes that while gold can perform well during periods of turmoil, its returns are unreliable over extended periods. Historical data shows the S&P 500 has provided a higher annualized total return over the last 30 years compared to gold. Experts argue that equities offer the benefits of earnings growth and dividends, which physical gold does not, making them a more effective hedge against inflation over time.

          <p>Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly backed manager Ruben Amorim, stating that the coach needs a three-year timeframe to prove himself. Despite a poor start to the season and a 15th-place league finish last year, Ratcliffe dismissed speculation that Amorim's job was in immediate danger. He criticized the media's demand for "overnight success" and affirmed that the club will not make knee-jerk reactions. Ratcliffe, who controls football operations, asserted that he aims to make Manchester United the most profitable club in the world, which he believes will lead to long-term, sustainable success on the field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lesser-known financial product, the single-purpose reverse mortgage, offers a targeted way for homeowners aged 62 and older to access home equity for a specific, pre-approved need, such as paying property taxes or making essential home repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state or local agencies and nonprofits, often to lower-income seniors. They generally have lower costs and fees because their use is restricted. While borrowers make no monthly payments, the loan becomes due when the homeowner sells, moves out, or passes away, making it a viable option for some retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial expert and entrepreneur Tori Dunlap, who previously credited renting with enabling her to build a multimillion-dollar business, has purchased her first home at age 31. Dunlap explains that while renting offered flexibility for travel and business growth, she grew tired of the instability of landlords selling her rental properties. With her business and personal life now more settled, she prioritized the emotional desire for a stable home over purely financial metrics. She strategically used a mortgage, putting 60% down to maintain cash reserves for unexpected repairs, demonstrating how debt can be used as leverage even for those with high net worth.</p>
