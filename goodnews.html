          <p>Theresa Fortune, an Oakland mother, is using her art to share her experiences with postpartum depression and inspire others. After struggling with suicidal thoughts following childbirth, Fortune turned to photography and collage to document her journey and recovery. Her artwork, including a piece called "Womban of the Earth," caught the attention of Kaiser Permanente, which has now permanently displayed her latest major work at their Oakland facility.

          <p>Los Angeles City Council members moved forward with a vote to increase the minimum wage for tourism workers to $30 per hour by 2028, despite warnings from city lawyers that the vote could violate the state's open meeting law. Senior Assistant City Attorney Michael J. Dundas advised the council to delay the vote to comply with the Ralph M. Brown Act, but the council proceeded anyway. A do-over vote was held two days later, yielding the same result. The decision to proceed despite legal concerns has raised questions about the motivations of Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson and potential benefits for Unite Here Local 11, a hotel workers' union.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that had been submerged in Lake Michigan for over a century. The tugboat, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and transporting railway cars. It was scuttled in 1923 and remained buried in the sand until storms recently exposed it. Historians are racing to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels destroy them.</p>
