The win serves as a powerful comeback for Anisimova, who had suffered a heavy 6-0 6-0 defeat to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final just 53 days prior. Playing with confidence and a powerful offense, Anisimova produced 23 winners, describing the performance as a special moment that proved her capabilities.

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has reached a settlement in a five-year-long lawsuit concerning educational support following the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide high-intensity tutoring to approximately 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students who experienced significant learning setbacks. Filed by a group of parents, the lawsuit alleged that the district failed to meet state standards during remote learning, disproportionately affecting Black and Latino students. The settlement mandates at least 45 hours of tutoring per year for three years, regular student assessments, and additional teacher training.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser, causing the stock of its parent company, Alphabet, to rise by 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta had previously deemed Google a "monopolist" in online search, he concluded that divesting Chrome would be an overly complex and risky remedy. However, the judge did impose other restrictions, including requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with certain rivals to help foster competition. The Department of Justice supported the remedies as a step forward, though some advocacy groups felt the ruling did not go far enough.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence from whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, setting a legal precedent in New York state. This cutting-edge technique allowed investigators to link Heuermann and his family to nine degraded, rootless hair strands found on the remains of six victims. The defense had argued the method was unreliable, but the judge determined its principles are accepted within the scientific community. The ruling is considered a major victory for prosecutors, though the defense has already challenged it on the grounds that the testing lab is not licensed in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants for Harvard University, ruling the action was illegal. The court found that the administration likely used concerns about antisemitism on campus as a pretext to retaliate against the university for its ideological positions and refusal to alter its policies. The ruling vacates the freeze orders, which had halted work on numerous critical research projects, including studies on veteran suicide prevention and Lou Gehrig's disease. The judge stated that while combating antisemitism is a worthy goal, the funding cuts were not linked to that issue.</p>

          <p>Veteran all-rounder Ravi Bopara scored a spectacular 45-ball century to lead Northamptonshire to a seven-run victory over Surrey in a rain-shortened T20 Blast quarter-final. The 40-year-old's unbeaten 105 guided his team to a total of 154-4 from their 14 overs after an early setback. Despite a strong chase led by Surrey captain Sam Curran, who scored an unbeaten 69, the home side fell just short, finishing on 147-6. The victory means Northamptonshire will advance to Finals Day for the first time since 2016, the same year they last won the competition.</p>

          <p>Félix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the US Open semi-finals for the second time in his career after a grueling four-set victory over Alex de Minaur. The Canadian player won the tense, four-hour match 4-6, 7-6 (7), 7-5, 7-6 (4), demonstrating resilience in crucial moments despite a high number of errors from both players. This marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and confidence in recent years, falling from a career-high ranking of No. 6. The defeat is another quarter-final heartbreak for de Minaur, who has yet to advance to a Grand Slam semi-final in six attempts.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced the Restore Trust in Congress Act, a new bill aimed at banning members of Congress, their spouses, and dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks. The legislation consolidates several previous proposals and would require lawmakers to sell their individual stock holdings shortly after taking office. The bill has garnered support from across the political spectrum, from progressive Democrats to conservative Republicans, who argue the current rules erode public trust. Supporters are threatening to force a floor vote if leadership does not bring the bill for consideration by the end of the month. (not investment advice)</p>
