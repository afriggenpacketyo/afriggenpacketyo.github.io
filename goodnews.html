          <p>Three large wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for several weeks, prompting evacuations that have since been lifted. Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires began around May 12th, and Governor Tim Walz is expected to provide an update on the state's response. Meanwhile, crews are also battling substantial wildfires in Manitoba, Canada, leading to air quality alerts in the Arrowhead region of Minnesota. The US Forest Service believes the Jenkins Creek Fire was human caused, while the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources and the forest service are managing the other fires.</p>

Musk thanked President Trump on X, noting that his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team would continue its work. As a special government employee, Musk's appointment was limited to 130 days, a limit he was approaching, which led to his departure.

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed strong sales growth, driven by high demand for its graphics processors in the data center division for artificial intelligence applications. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, which CEO Jensen Huang estimates to be a $50 billion market. Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for roughly half of the company's data center revenue.

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering higher returns than the inflation rate, providing an opportunity to save money and maintain buying power. The national average for a 1-year CD is 2.01% APY, while a 5-year CD yields 1.72% APY, but some banks offer rates as high as 4.41% APY for 6-month CDs. Online banks often provide more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs may offer the best rates currently. An inverted yield curve means short-term CDs have higher interest rates than longer terms, and laddering CDs can help take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term (not investment advice).</p>
