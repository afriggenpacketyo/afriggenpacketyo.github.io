          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached to end the New Jersey Transit strike, which halted train service for three days and disrupted commutes for hundreds of thousands of riders. The agreement, reached between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, will allow trains to resume a full schedule on Tuesday morning after safety inspections are completed. Governor Philip D. Murphy expressed relief and urged commuters to work from home on Monday to facilitate the resumption of service. The main sticking point had been the engineers‚Äô demand that they be paid on par with their counterparts who drive trains for other passenger railroads.</p>

Patients registering with a GP practice who received a blood transfusion before 1996 will be offered a hepatitis C test, aiming to address the lack of testing that left many unaware of their infection for decades.

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan could rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreigners. The yuan is already used for cross-border purchase settlements, but China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract more foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. The economist cited China's 'connect' schemes with Hong Kong as a model for increasing foreign access to mainland Chinese bonds and stocks, while also acknowledging convertibility as a concern for investors outside the mainland.</p>

Anduril's weapons, including the Fury unmanned fighter jet and Dive XL submarine, are designed to operate autonomously, with human intervention possible through a "kill switch."
