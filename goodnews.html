          <p>Social media users have reacted to the ongoing feud between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, with many seeing it as a "catfight" and expressing dissatisfaction with the current state of politics. The spat, which unfolded on platforms like X and Truth Social, has drawn a mix of support, criticism, and memes from users worldwide. Experts suggest the feud distracts from larger political issues and reflects public distrust of elected leaders. Despite the entertainment value, some worry about the detrimental impact on addressing pressing concerns like budget cuts.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that their legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Established in 1974, the CBO provides objective information on the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. The CBO's cost estimates are advisory, with lawmakers deciding how to use the information, and the agency enforces strict rules limiting employees' political activities.</p>

It strives to bridge differences by academic inquiry, which in my opinion transcends religion, culture or politics. The author worked alongside researchers from many European countries as well as the United States, coming to Harvard through the same visa programme the Trump administration now seeks to eliminate. If it succeeds in depriving Harvard of programmes like the one that made my stay possible, the centre would become orphaned overnight.</p>
