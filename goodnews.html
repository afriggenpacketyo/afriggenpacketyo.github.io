        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DW report examines the potential trend of rising retirement ages in Europe, exemplified by Denmark's recent legislation to raise the retirement age to 70 for those born after 1970. The article explores how demographic changes, such as aging populations and shrinking workforces, are straining pension systems across the continent. It contrasts the Bismarck and Beveridge models of pension financing and discusses the economic and social implications of both longer working lives and earlier retirement. Germany is considering similar reforms, highlighting the broader challenges European nations face in balancing pension sustainability with individual well-being. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permanently blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. The judge, Richard Leon, emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating the order suppressed disfavored speech by imposing severe sanctions on the firm. WilmerHale previously employed former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. This is the third time a judge has struck down one of Trump's executive orders targeting law firms associated with his political adversaries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a team from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) can access a sensitive Treasury Department system that controls trillions of dollars in federal payments. Judge Jeannette Vargas granted permission after the Trump administration demonstrated a system to train employees to prevent improper disclosures.

          <p>Harvard University has settled a six-year legal battle with Tamara Lanier, a woman claiming to be a descendant of enslaved people depicted in two 175-year-old daguerreotypes. The images, originally commissioned by a Harvard professor for a racist theory, will be transferred to the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina. Lanier sued Harvard in 2019, arguing the university profited from the images, and views the settlement as a reckoning for institutions holding plundered property.

This strategy aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emission vehicles in the state by 2035.
