          <p>The Bank of Russia has reduced interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, indicating that inflation pressures are subsiding. This decision follows a period of high inflation triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which significantly strained prices and weakened the ruble. The central bank had maintained rates at 21% since October 2024, the highest level since 2013. April's inflation rate was reported at 6.2%, a decrease from the first quarter's average of 8.2%.

          <p>Experts suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) could significantly alter or eliminate entry-level positions for recent college graduates, particularly in white-collar fields. This shift is driven by advances in AI-fueled chatbots and increasing automation efforts by companies. While some believe AI will replace jobs, others predict a reorientation, emphasizing the need for problem-solving and AI utilization skills. The softening job market for college graduates is also attributed to broader economic uncertainties.</p>
