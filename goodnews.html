          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged the legality of the city's sanctuary policies. Judge Lindsay Jenkins, a Biden appointee, ruled that Chicago's ordinances, which limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, are lawful and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The Justice Department had argued these policies unlawfully interfere with federal authority and aimed to compel cooperation with its immigration crackdown. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating it affirms the city's right to prioritize local public safety needs over federal immigration agendas.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams recently joked that she returned to competition to regain her health insurance, highlighting a struggle familiar to many Americans. The article uses her situation to explore the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system, where insurance is often tied to employment. It discusses the high cost of COBRA for those between jobs, the challenges for individuals with pre-existing conditions like Williams, and the significant changes brought by the Affordable Care Act. Her experience, though unique in scale, serves as a relatable example of how even the wealthy must navigate a system that links health benefits directly to work.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions clinched a dramatic series victory against Australia after Hugo Keenan scored a game-winning try in the final minute of a thrilling Test match in Melbourne. The Lions overcame a significant 23-5 first-half deficit in a contest filled with momentum swings and six tries in the opening period alone. Australia, driven by a powerful performance, shocked the tourists early before the Lions mounted a remarkable comeback. The final score of 29-26 was confirmed after a tense review, sealing the Lions' first series win with two initial Test victories since 1997 in front of a record crowd.</p>

          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Effort to Oust Opposition Lawmakers in Recall Election</h2>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, and this outcome signals continued political headwinds for President Lai Ching-te's administration. Supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation and passing of controversial reforms seen as favoring China, while the KMT framed the effort as political retaliation undermining democracy.</p>

          <p>A routine pre-surgery X-ray led to a terminal diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for Christopher Kennedy, a 68-year-old dog trainer with no prior symptoms. Faced with a prognosis of less than a year to live, he was initially hesitant but ultimately underwent a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. Despite his age and post-surgery complications, Kennedy's recovery has been remarkable, with his lung capacity now at 98%. The experience has given him a new perspective on life, and he is now training a new therapy dog named 'Encore' to celebrate his second chance.</p>

          <p>Leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have used a major conference in Shanghai to call for international collaboration, particularly between the U.S. and China, to manage the risks of advanced artificial intelligence. Hinton warned that without cooperation, humanity risks losing control of AI, comparing the technology to a "cute tiger cub" that could mature into a dangerous threat. He emphasized that despite divergent national interests on many issues, preventing an AI takeover is a critical common ground. This call for collaboration comes amid escalating tech competition between the two global powers, highlighting a shared existential concern among some of the field's pioneers.</p>

          <p>While many couples are using credit cards to pay for increasingly expensive weddings, financial experts advise a strategic approach to avoid starting a marriage with high-interest debt. Using a card can be smart for earning rewards like points or miles, especially with large sign-up bonuses, but only if the balance is paid off immediately with existing savings. The article warns against carrying a balance, as average credit card APRs are at a high. It also suggests asking vendors about credit card fees or potential cash discounts, and considering dedicated wedding insurance for broader protection than credit cards can offer.</p>

          <p>A proposed federal law, the Captive Primate Safety Act, aims to combat the brutal illegal pet trade by banning the private ownership and breeding of primates across all 50 states. Animal welfare experts at the Oakland Zoo, which recently rescued a smuggled spider monkey, explain that the trade is fueled by social media and results in immense suffering. Poachers often kill entire family troops to capture infants, who then face chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage in captivity. The bill, currently stalled in a House committee, is seen by a coalition of zoos and animal welfare groups as a key step in protecting these animals.</p>

          <p>China has released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, intensifying the technological competition with the United States just days after the U.S. announced its own plan. Speaking at a major conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation and proposed a global AI organization, emphasizing China's willingness to share its technology, particularly with the Global South. This move is seen by analysts as an effort by China to build a multilateral coalition for AI development and regulation, contrasting with the U.S. approach of building a camp with its allies while restricting China's access to advanced technology.

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen secured a victory in the Belgian Grand Prix sprint race, successfully holding off a strong challenge from McLaren drivers Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Verstappen overtook Piastri, who started on pole, on the first lap and used his car's superior straight-line speed to maintain the lead throughout the 15-lap race. Piastri remained close behind but was unable to mount a successful challenge for the lead. The result gives Verstappen's Red Bull team a winning start under its new principal and sets up an intriguing strategic dilemma for McLaren ahead of Sunday's main Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland this weekend in a high-stakes effort to secure a framework trade agreement. The meeting aims to prevent a threatened 30% U.S. tariff on EU imports from taking effect on August 1st. There is growing optimism for a breakthrough, with sources suggesting a potential deal could include a 15% baseline tariff, similar to the recent U.S.-Japan agreement. While not ideal for the EU, such a deal would avert a more damaging trade war and provide stability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
