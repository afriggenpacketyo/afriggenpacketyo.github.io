          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 06:30:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's struggling property market may be approaching its lowest point, with some analysts observing positive indicators of a potential recovery. Credit is reportedly flowing back to developers, and the inventory of unsold homes has decreased, leading Fitch Ratings to revise its forecast for the decline in new home sales. The market has also seen consolidation, with state-owned developers increasing their market share, a factor HSBC suggests has helped stabilize the sector. This offers a glimmer of hope after a prolonged downturn that began in 2021.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decline in its second-quarter revenue, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite the profit decline, the company's adjusted net income surpassed analyst expectations, and CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, anticipating a significant rise in oil demand in the latter half of the year. The energy giant plans to increase capital expenditure and is focusing on expanding its gas production to meet future demand. The results come as the company navigates market uncertainty and continues to be a crucial source of income for Saudi Arabia's economic diversification plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>BP reported a second-quarter profit that surpassed analyst forecasts, prompting an increase in its dividend and a continuation of its share buyback program. The positive financial results were accompanied by the announcement of a significant oil and gas discovery off the coast of Brazil, described as the company's largest in 25 years. CEO Murray Auchincloss expressed optimism about the find and reaffirmed the company's strategic shift to refocus on its core hydrocarbon business. This performance comes amid takeover speculation and pressure to improve profitability after years of underperformance.</p>

          <p>Universal is launching "Horror Unleashed" in Las Vegas, a permanent, year-round attraction based on its popular Halloween Horror Nights event, signaling a new trend in the theme park industry. The experience features elaborate haunted houses, themed bars, and interactive characters, aiming to capitalize on the growing, year-round popularity of the horror genre. While some question the market for constant horror, especially in the Las Vegas heat, industry experts note that Halloween has evolved into a lifestyle culture. This move reflects a broader cultural shift where darker fantasies are in demand beyond the traditional October season.</p>

          <p>South Korea has started to take down the massive loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border into North Korea. The move is described by the defense ministry as a practical step to ease military tensions and follows a directive from President Lee Jae Myung's administration, which advocates for reconciliation. These broadcasts, which have included K-pop music and critical news, have been a source of friction for decades, at times leading to military exchanges. While the dismantling is a gesture of goodwill, its impact on the deeply chilled inter-Korean relations remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Actor Bella Ramsey reflects on the challenges and fulfillment of taking the lead in the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us," especially after the departure of co-star Pedro Pascal's character. Ramsey discusses tackling new physical skills for the role and the emotional weight of key scenes, noting that embodying the character of Ellie now feels like second nature. As the first out nonbinary actor to receive multiple Emmy nominations, Ramsey expresses gratitude for the recognition. They hope their visibility helps other gender-nonconforming people feel seen and accepted on a larger scale.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands has announced it will be the first country to purchase U.S. weapons for Ukraine through a new NATO funding mechanism. The Dutch government is committing €500 million to the plan, which will supply Patriot missile parts and other critical defense systems to Kyiv. This initiative, known as the PURL scheme, was established to allow NATO allies to cover the cost of U.S. military aid for Ukraine, a condition set by President Trump. The move is intended to increase pressure on Russia and bolster European security amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>An author details her experience using ChatGPT as a mediator for a disagreement with her boyfriend, exploring the growing trend of turning to AI for relationship advice. Initially, the chatbot's feedback felt clichéd and biased, reflecting stereotypes about emotional labor in relationships. After refining prompts to demand more neutrality and accountability, the AI provided some simple but insightful feedback that helped the author see her partner's perspective. The experiment concludes that while AI can offer a quick, synthesized analysis, it lacks the nuanced understanding of human chemistry and can't replace the difficult but essential work of direct communication between partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the city's public defender system stands as a testament to profound change born from chaos. The storm exposed a deeply flawed system where part-time, under-resourced lawyers struggled to represent a massive incarcerated population. In the aftermath, a new generation of legal advocates rebuilt the office from the ground up, establishing a full-time, professional staff with investigators and social workers. This transformation, which eventually led to funding parity with the district attorney's office, has created a fairer, more functional criminal justice system.</p>
