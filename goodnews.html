This denial came after the report caused a surge in the stocks of several quantum firms. While the administration has previously taken stakes in industries vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, it is not currently pursuing this strategy with the nascent quantum computing sector. The industry is seen as critical for future military and technological applications but has yet to generate significant revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines, long known as a discount carrier, is implementing significant changes to appeal to premium travelers and increase revenue. The airline is abandoning its decades-old open boarding policy in favor of assigned seating, introducing an extra legroom section, and has already begun charging for checked bags. These updates, which also include larger overhead bins and better Wi-Fi, are designed to make Southwest more competitive with other major airlines. While these changes will offer more options for passengers willing to pay for upgrades, they mark a fundamental shift away from the airline's original low-cost, no-frills model.</p>

          <p>A new study published in *Nature* indicates that mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, like those from Pfizer and Moderna, may significantly improve the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Researchers found that late-stage melanoma and lung cancer patients who received a COVID-19 vaccine while undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment had substantially higher three-year survival rates. The study suggests the mRNA vaccine acts as an "alarm," activating the immune system to better recognize and attack tumor cells, potentially turning previously unresponsive "cold" tumors "hot." A nationwide clinical trial is being planned to validate these promising findings.</p>

          <p>Shares of Honeywell increased by 7% following the release of a strong quarterly earnings report that surpassed expectations. The industrial conglomerate's organic revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and profit margins all met or exceeded the upper end of its own guidance. This positive performance has bolstered investor confidence ahead of the planned spin-off of its advanced materials business, Solstice, next week. Analysts believe the spin-off will help clarify the company's value proposition, which has previously been weighed down by the complexity of its diverse operations, making it difficult for investors to fully understand its core business.

While the overall results are still below the market average, investors were encouraged by the positive trajectory across Kering's major brands, including Saint Laurent and Balenciaga.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the adage that money can't buy happiness, concluding that wealth can indeed increase well-being, but only under specific conditions. Citing psychological research, the author argues that materialism and the pursuit of money for reasons like social comparison, power, or overcoming self-doubt are negatively correlated with life satisfaction. However, earning money for security or to support family does not have the same negative effect. The key to happiness is not the amount of money one has, but rather one's motives for earning it and how it is spent, with experiences and time being more valuable than possessions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 11:55:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, actor Jeremy Strong reflected on his intensive, immersive approach to acting, which he acknowledges can sound "witchy." For his roles as Roy Cohn in "The Apprentice" and Bruce Springsteen's manager Jon Landau in "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," he engaged in deep research and preparation to fully inhabit the characters. While filming the Springsteen biopic, he had the unique opportunity to consult directly with Landau and Springsteen on set, using their insights to add emotional depth to his performance. Strong explained that his goal is to create an "anechoic chamber" where the character takes possession of him, a process he finds essential for authenticity.</p>
