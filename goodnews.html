          <p>The Bank of England has lowered its main interest rate by a quarter-point, from 4.25% to 4.0%, continuing its cautious approach to monetary policy. The decision was made by a slim 5-4 majority on the Monetary Policy Committee, reflecting differing views on how to manage the economy. Policymakers are balancing persistent inflation, which rose unexpectedly in June, against signs of a cooling labor market and economic contraction. The bank signaled that future rate cuts will be gradual and dependent on the easing of underlying inflationary pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has raised its 2025 financial outlook after reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by surging demand for its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Zepbound and Mounjaro. The company now projects sales between $60 billion and $62 billion for the fiscal year. However, the announcement was tempered by disappointing late-stage trial results for its experimental obesity pill, orforglipron, which caused a significant drop in its premarket share price. The company's guidance does not account for potential future tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A scholar from a top Communist Party institute has suggested that China should aim for an annual GDP growth rate of around 5% during its upcoming 15th five-year plan. Writing in the Study Times, Professor Cui Youping argued that a growth rate of at least 4.5% is necessary to achieve the national goal of reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. This benchmark, set by the party in 2022, corresponds to a per capita GDP of approximately $30,000, a significant increase from China's 2024 level of $13,400. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new Taiwanese television drama, "Zero Day Attack," which depicts a fictional Chinese invasion, has become a ratings hit while igniting a national conversation about the island's readiness and resilience. The show is part of a growing trend in Taiwanese media and gaming to explore the once-taboo subject of a potential conflict with Beijing, a shift inspired in part by the war in Ukraine. While some praise these works for raising awareness about infiltration tactics, others, including opposition politicians, criticize them for promoting a "sense of national doom." The trend reflects a break from self-censorship and a new willingness to confront geopolitical realities.</p>

          <p>A fabricated story claiming that Russian special forces captured three senior British military officers in Ukraine has been widely debunked despite spreading across social media and being shared by former UK politicians. The narrative, which used demonstrably AI-generated images and non-existent names, was traced back to Russian media outlets. According to disinformation experts, this is a typical Russian propaganda tactic designed to sow discord and project an image of military strength to a domestic audience. The story relies on the trope of "Anglo-Saxons" orchestrating the war, a common theme in Kremlin-backed disinformation campaigns.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30 years after D.C. police officer Denna Fredericka Campbell was killed, her former live-in boyfriend has been arrested and charged with her murder. Amir Jalil Ali, previously known as Kenneth Burnell Wonsom, was initially charged in 1995, but the charges were inexplicably dropped. Investigators reopened the case, citing that Campbell had expressed fear of her boyfriend to colleagues, telling one that if she didn't show up for work, "you'll know he killed me." Police believe Ali killed Campbell during an altercation and staged the scene to look like a burglary.</p>

          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force successfully evacuated three people requiring medical attention from the U.S. McMurdo Station in Antarctica in a high-risk, mid-winter operation. The mission was carried out in 24-hour darkness and sub-zero temperatures, requiring the crew to use night vision goggles to land a C-130J Hercules on a manually prepared ice runway. U.S. officials, who requested the evacuation due to insufficient medical resources at the base, praised the nearly 20-hour mission as "nothing short of heroic." Such flights are considered extremely challenging due to the harsh and unpredictable Antarctic winter conditions.</p>

Using EEG sensors, their products can measure focus, distraction, and are being developed to track broader brain health metrics, potentially detecting early signs of conditions like depression or Alzheimer's. Unlike most health trackers that measure downstream effects like heart rate, this technology taps directly into brainwaves. While major tech companies like Apple are exploring similar concepts, Neurable already has a product on the market, raising possibilities for health breakthroughs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study from Harvard Medical School suggests that a deficiency of the metal lithium in the brain could be a significant contributor to Alzheimer's disease. The research found that lithium occurs naturally in the brain and is crucial for maintaining nerve cell function, and its loss is one of the earliest changes leading to the disease. In mouse models, restoring lithium levels with a compound called lithium orotate, which is effective at very low doses, helped restore memory. These findings could offer a new strategy for early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of Alzheimer's.</p>

One of the climbers had sustained a head injury in a fall, and deteriorating weather conditions, including clouds and wildfire smoke, hampered initial rescue efforts. A North Shore Rescue team using a helicopter and night vision goggles was finally able to conduct the technical hoist rescue on the morning of August 6. Officials described the operation as a complex task involving night flying and technical mountain rescue skills.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk, a key indicator of global trade health, has raised its full-year profit forecast after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings. The company cited resilient demand for ocean freight, particularly driven by a manufacturing boom in China and strong exports globally, with the notable exception of the United States. CEO Vincent Clerc attributed the slowdown in U.S. demand to the uncertainty caused by tariff policies. The company now expects global container market volume to grow by 2% to 4% in 2025, an upward revision from its previous forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Democratic party is losing support among working-class voters and must embrace a bold economic populist message to win them back. Citing a new report, the authors assert that policies like raising the minimum wage, taxing the rich, and expanding social programs are widely popular across the political spectrum. The article highlights several local and state-level candidates who are successfully running on such platforms. It contends that the national party's reluctance to lead with class-focused economics creates a vacuum that allows Republicans to misleadingly posture as the party of the people.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering new legislation aimed at making it easier for veterans to use their VA benefits for care at non-VA facilities, a program known as community care. Republican-led proposals would streamline the referral process, particularly for rural veterans who often live far from VA hospitals. Supporters argue this provides necessary convenience and choice, while critics, including some Democrats and veterans' groups, worry it could drain funds from the VA's specialized care system. The debate centers on how to best serve veterans without weakening the core VA infrastructure that many rely on.</p>
