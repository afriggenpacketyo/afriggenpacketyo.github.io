          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a new trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most EU goods exported to the US. This agreement, reached between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, averts a potential trade war and the threatened 30% tariff rate. The deal also includes a commitment from the EU to invest hundreds of billions in US energy and military equipment, aiming to rebalance the trade relationship. While both leaders hailed the agreement as a victory, the full details and long-term benefits for each side are still being analyzed.</p>

          <p>A detailed profile of comedian John Oliver explores his career, from his early stand-up days at the Edinburgh Fringe festival to his influential role as the host of HBO's "Last Week Tonight." The article highlights his method of using meticulously researched, deep-dive segments to satirize complex and often obscure systemic problems in the United States. Oliver explains that he views comedy as a powerful tool to illuminate serious issues, and that criticizing something you love is a way to push for its improvement. His show combines rigorous journalism with absurdity to engage audiences on topics not typically found in comedy.</p>

          <p>In a major law enforcement action dubbed "Operation Grayskull," the U.S. Justice Department has shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material. The investigation led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or used the network, which had over 120,000 members worldwide. One of the key figures, William Spearman, known as "Boss," was sentenced to life in prison for his role as a lead administrator. Officials called the operation one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and prolific criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>Bubba Wallace made history at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, becoming the first Black driver to win on the iconic 2.5-mile oval by capturing the Brickyard 400. The victory, his third in the NASCAR Cup Series, snapped a 100-race winless streak and marked his first win in one of the sport's crown jewel events. Wallace held off a late charge from Kyle Larson through two overtime restarts, a rain delay, and concerns about fuel levels. The emotional win was a significant moment for Wallace and the 23XI Racing team, co-owned by Michael Jordan and Denny Hamlin.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent underperformance of Honeywell's stock, which has declined despite the company reporting positive earnings and raising its future guidance. The author suggests the market may be reacting to the complexity of the conglomerate's planned breakup into three separate companies, a process that can create investor impatience. Despite the stock's puzzling drop, the author maintains conviction in the company's long-term value, citing its strong position in aerospace, automation, and materials. The piece argues against selling based on frustration, drawing parallels to past missed opportunities with companies like Oracle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Johns Hopkins University professor Yuen Yuen Ang discusses the complex economic and political landscape of modern China. Ang, an influential scholar on Chinese development, addresses the concept of a "polycrisis" and how it might be transformed into a "polytunity" for adaptive growth. She also touches upon the decline in American expertise on China, contrasting the current situation with the era when pioneers of US-China relations purposefully invested in building deep understanding between the two nations. Her work focuses on China's unique trajectory in an increasingly fragmented world.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with US President Donald Trump in Scotland to discuss the new transatlantic trade deal and the ongoing crisis in Gaza. Starmer is expected to push for lower tariffs on key UK imports like steel, building on a recent agreement that lowered some duties. The Prime Minister will also navigate a delicate diplomatic position on the Middle East, balancing the US stance with that of European allies, some of whom are moving toward recognizing a Palestinian state.

          <p>An analysis of the new trade agreement between the US and the European Union suggests that while both sides can claim a victory, the true implications remain uncertain. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on many EU goods, is seen as a personal achievement for President Trump, who has consistently sought to renegotiate US trade relationships. However, questions linger about the specifics of the EU's investment commitments and how much the deal truly addresses the US trade deficit. The agreement also provides Washington with momentum heading into separate, high-stakes trade negotiations with China.</p>
