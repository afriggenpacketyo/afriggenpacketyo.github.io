          <p>The WWE World Heavyweight Championship has been officially vacated following an injury sustained by Seth Rollins during an event in Australia. On "Monday Night Raw," general manager Adam Pearce made the announcement, setting up a new title match between CM Punk and Jey Uso to be held at the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event. Jey Uso earned his spot by winning a battle royal, from which key members of the Vision faction were barred. The development leaves the championship picture open while Rollins recovers, with his return anticipated around WrestleMania 42 season next year.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Spacewoman" chronicles the pioneering career of Eileen Collins, who made history as the first woman to both pilot and command a NASA Space Shuttle. Collins overcame the challenges of a male-dominated field, joining the Air Force to become a test pilot before being selected for the astronaut program. She commanded the critical "return to flight" mission in 2005 following the tragic loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, a role that required immense bravery and leadership. The film explores her determination and the significant responsibility she felt to set a high standard for future female astronauts.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged over 2% to achieve a sixth straight record high, driven by investor optimism regarding an impending trade deal with the United States. The rally, which has seen the index rise approximately 61% year-to-date, was bolstered by strong performances from auto stocks like Hyundai and Kia. This positive market movement in South Korea mirrors gains across other Asian markets, including Japan's Nikkei 225, which also hit a new record. The sentiment was initially sparked by comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary suggesting trade negotiations were nearing completion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement aimed at boosting the supply of rare earths and other critical minerals, a strategic move to reduce reliance on China's market control. The deal will facilitate an initial joint investment of $1 billion into mining and processing projects in both countries, supporting a pipeline of projects valued at $8.5 billion. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated the partnership will elevate collaboration to the "next level." The announcement prompted a surge in the stock prices of Australian rare earth mining companies, reflecting investor confidence in the new strategic alliance.</p>

          <p>The University of Arizona has become the seventh U.S. university to formally reject the Trump administration's proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education." The proposal offers priority federal funding to institutions that agree to adopt a conservative agenda, including changes to admissions, hiring, and definitions of gender. In a letter to the Department of Education, the university's president affirmed a commitment to foundational principles like academic freedom and merit-based research funding. This decision aligns with rejections from several other prominent universities, including MIT, Brown, and Dartmouth, which have also declined to sign the compact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a friendly meeting between President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Australia is reportedly reassessing its reliance on the United States as its primary ally. The Trump administration's "America First" policies, including tariffs and a review of the AUKUS defense pact, have introduced a level of uncertainty into the long-standing relationship. While the meeting resulted in a renewed commitment to AUKUS and a critical minerals deal, the unpredictable nature of the administration has fueled a growing distrust among some Australians. However, with rising tensions in the Indo-Pacific region, many still view the alliance as essential for national security.</p>

          <p>The AUKUS security pact is a multi-billion dollar defense agreement between Australia, the UK, and the US, centered on providing Australia with nuclear-powered submarine technology. This deal is designed to replace Australia's aging submarine fleet and significantly enhance its military capabilities in the Indo-Pacific region, widely seen as a counter to China's growing influence. The pact's first pillar involves Australia purchasing several US Virginia-class submarines before jointly developing a new model. The second pillar focuses on collaboration in advanced military technologies like AI, hypersonic missiles, and undersea robotics, strengthening the trilateral alliance.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden, 82, has finished a course of radiation therapy for an aggressive, high-risk form of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in May. The treatment was administered at the University of Pennsylvania's Radiation Oncology clinic. His daughter, Ashley Biden, shared a video of him ringing a bell at the clinic, a tradition that symbolizes the end of a treatment phase, and expressed gratitude to the medical staff. This follows a separate procedure in September to remove skin cancer lesions. Biden is scheduled to receive a lifetime achievement award in Boston later this week.</p>

          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a city of 8,000 people, has begun regulating the use of golf carts on public roads due to a boom in their popularity for local transportation. With an estimated 2,000 carts in the city, officials have implemented new rules for safety, including restricting them to streets with speed limits of 25 mph or less. The ordinance also requires carts to pass inspections for signals and horns, and mandates that drivers be at least 18 years old with a valid license. This local action reflects a growing trend across the country as more communities adapt to non-traditional vehicles sharing the road.</p>

          <p>Childhood peanut allergy rates have dropped by approximately 43% since medical guidelines were updated to recommend early exposure to the allergen, according to a new study. Research published in 2015 found that feeding peanut products to high-risk babies significantly reduced their allergy risk, reversing decades of advice to avoid such foods. This real-world data, analyzing health records of nearly 120,000 children, confirms the effectiveness of the new approach, with an estimated 40,000 children avoiding a peanut allergy diagnosis. Experts are hailing the findings as a major public health success and a call to continue improving allergy prevention strategies.</p>

          <p>President Trump's renewed calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are occurring as the city experiences a significant economic and social resurgence, largely fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Despite ongoing issues like homelessness, crime rates are down, tourism is rising, and venture capital funding in the Bay Area's AI sector is set to break records. Local officials, including the mayor, have pushed back against the need for federal troops, highlighting the success of local law enforcement. The debate has intensified after some tech executives initially supported the idea before later retracting their statements amid criticism.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans participated in "No Kings" marches across the country, marking one of the largest single-day demonstrations in U.S. history and signaling broad opposition to President Trump's authoritarian actions. The protests, which were geographically widespread and largely peaceful, serve as a visible counter-narrative to the administration's claims of unstoppable momentum. While not expected to produce immediate policy changes, the movement provides an outlet for dissent and may influence wavering political allies and voters. The large, energetic crowds are seen as an antidote to political despair and a sign of a re-energized opposition ahead of future elections.</p>
