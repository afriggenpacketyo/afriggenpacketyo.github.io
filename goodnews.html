          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded to state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant upset. Cuomo, who resigned in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal, was attempting a political comeback. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, would be the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City if elected in the general election.

An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error." Mish and Lucy were rescued in 2021 after being abandoned as cubs in Albania.</p>

The committee emphasizes the importance of reducing electricity costs to incentivize households to switch to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are growing rapidly and heat pump sales are up, electricity prices remain high due to factors like international gas prices and charges for renewable energy projects.

The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

The assessment, conducted by the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff also assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and that it is "not even conceivable" that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within a matter of months.</p>

The study found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research presents direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time.</p>
