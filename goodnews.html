        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from Vox discusses how a federal court is attempting to address President Trump's actions to weaken civil service protections. Trump has been accused of neutralizing federal agencies by firing officials responsible for safeguarding civil servants from political influence. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit proposed that if the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) cannot fulfill its legal duties due to Trump's actions, federal courts should intervene to hear cases from illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole and ensure that federal workers retain job protections, even if the MSPB's independence is compromised. The court's decision could have significant implications for the functioning of the government and the rights of civil servants.</p>

          <p>According to a DW article, an AI program trained to analyze handwriting styles suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than initially estimated. This study combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately determine the age of ancient texts. The findings could reshape our understanding of the Dead Sea Scrolls and their significance in Judaism and early Christianity. By using AI to reduce subjectivity in paleography, researchers aim to improve the reliability of dating ancient manuscripts and potentially rewrite the chronology of these important historical documents.</p>

          <p>According to NPR, Medicare negotiations are underway to lower prices for the next batch of drugs, including Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Amgen's Otezla. These negotiations, initiated under the Inflation Reduction Act, mark the second round of annual bargaining aimed at reducing drug costs for Medicare recipients. The government has until November 30 to announce the agreed-upon prices, which will take effect in January 2027. This process continues despite the transition between administrations, indicating a bipartisan commitment to lowering drug prices for seniors, with the goal of making medications more affordable and accessible.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC, Capture6, a startup based in Berkeley, California, has developed a technology that cleans water and removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere while reducing costs. The technology repurposes industrial and water treatment waste, generating clean water and capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Capture6's process involves extracting fresh water and separating salt into sodium and chlorine from brine waste. The company's CEO says that the sodium is then turned into lye, which bonds with CO2 from the air, capturing it and improving the environment, all while operating on renewable energy, thus allowing the company to sell carbon credits. This approach is particularly attractive in areas facing water scarcity and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>According to CBS News, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have seen significant fluctuations recently, and the likelihood of further declines after the Federal Reserve's June meeting depends on the post-meeting commentary. The chances of a rate cut in June are low, but if Fed Chair Jerome Powell hints at imminent reductions, HELOC rates could decrease slightly as lenders preemptively adjust their offers. However, if comments suggest higher rates for longer, HELOC rates might move upward or remain static. The article advises homeowners to monitor the situation and consider their risk tolerance when deciding whether to pursue a HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Debate Over Women in Combat Roles</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Vox, the debate over women in combat roles is explored through the experiences of Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School. Despite the Obama administration opening all combat jobs to women in 2015 and the implementation of gender-neutral fitness standards for certain roles, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth insists that the standards were lowered for women. Vanasse challenges this claim, asserting that she and other women met the same rigorous standards as their male counterparts. The discussion delves into the broader definition of lethality, encompassing not only physical fitness but also tactical skills, decision-making, and leadership, highlighting the complexities of integrating women into combat roles.</p>
