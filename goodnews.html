          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid increasing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and tightens potential loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist.</p>

The government plans a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving increased land supply and financing aid, aiming to halt the sector's decline and stabilize it.</p>

Following right elbow surgery, Ohtani had a promising live batting practice, leading to an earlier-than-expected return due to injuries in the Dodgers' bullpen. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noted Ohtani's eagerness to pitch, and the team anticipates short innings from him, while rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return remains uncertain due to a shoulder impingement.</p>
