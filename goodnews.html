          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 19:09:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government data from England reveals a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of the academic year and a student's likelihood of becoming persistently absent later on. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who missed any school during the first week went on to miss at least 10% of the school year, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat this trend, which has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. The data underscores the importance of establishing consistent attendance habits early in the term.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic model for international relations amid global paralysis. As a leader of a major economic power not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can champion a philosophy of "constructive pragmatism." This approach emphasizes cooperation over confrontation, offering a potential road map for a dysfunctional international system. The article argues that his leadership could provide a practical call to action that the world currently needs more than revolutionary rhetoric, leveraging the growing influence of middle-power nations.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, presenting an ambitious, nearly two-and-a-half-hour epic. The film, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, is a project del Toro has dreamed of making for decades. Early reviews are divided; some critics have praised it as one of the director's finest works for its epic scale and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance. Del Toro emphasized his goal was to explore the central question of what it means to be human, creating a story about imperfect characters and the right to remain so.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article explores how revisiting the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could offer a foundation for improving current bilateral ties. It highlights a forgotten front where American airmen and Chinese villagers worked together against Japanese forces, representing a period of mutual support and shared goals. By focusing on these historical instances of collaboration, the piece suggests a potential formula for fostering better understanding and diplomacy from the ground up. This historical perspective aims to reframe the narrative between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A request from a hotel owner in Machynlleth, Wales, to silence the town's 150-year-old clock overnight has been denied by the town council. The co-owner of the Wynnstay Hotel argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, regularly prompted complaints from guests, making it a reasonable request to pause it between midnight and 7 a.m. However, councillors rejected the proposal, stating that the chiming is part of the town's character. The clock recently underwent a £55,000 restoration funded by the council, and many local residents expressed that they consider the sound to be unobtrusive background noise.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," chronicles a love life unimproved by her recent ascent to superstardom. Following her massively successful album "Short n' Sweet," this new collection finds her dealing with a new cast of inadequate romantic partners. The album combines a 1970s AM-radio pop sound with touches of country and disco, while Carpenter's lyrics lampoon both her suitors and the social structures that leave her with such options. While not every song is as sharp as her previous work, the album showcases her witty, theatrical style and keen observational humor about modern relationships.</p>

          <p>A heavily rotated England team secured a dominant 92-3 victory over Samoa in the Women's Rugby World Cup, sealing their place in the knockout stages. Despite making 13 changes to the starting lineup, the world's top-ranked professional side overwhelmed the amateur Samoan team. Winger Jess Breach scored a hat-trick, and utility back Helena Rowland set a new individual points record for a World Cup game with 27 points. The match highlighted the depth of England's squad while also showcasing the challenges faced by smaller, underfunded nations like Samoa, whose players had to crowdfund their participation in the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Guidelines on Safe Screen Time for Children at Different Developmental Stages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines expert consensus on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that recommendations vary based on developmental stages. For children under three, the advice is to be nearly screen-free to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time can be introduced, but it's crucial that it doesn't replace essential activities like physical play and social interaction. For adolescents, open communication is key, as monitoring becomes more difficult. Experts stress that content quality is more important than screen duration, and parents should model healthy media habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a colossal hydrothermal field in the Pacific Ocean, named the Kunlun field, which is over one hundred times larger than the famous 'Lost City' in the Atlantic. This unique system features deep craters and vents that release cooler, hydrogen-rich fluids, believed to resemble the conditions on early Earth when life first began. The site supports a diverse ecosystem of deep-sea life, challenging previous assumptions about where such systems can form and offering new insights into abiogenesis. The discovery also highlights a potential new source for deep-sea hydrogen energy.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who provided two assists in the team's 3-2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. Since joining Everton on loan from Manchester City, Grealish has been in exceptional form, becoming the first Everton player to assist two or more goals in consecutive Premier League games. Moyes described Grealish as "even better than I thought," highlighting his creativity and presence on the field. Grealish's resurgence comes after being left out of the latest England squad, suggesting he is motivated to prove his capabilities and fight for a spot in the national team.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Wales, took matters into their own hands to save thousands of fish stranded in a drying brook following a prolonged period of hot, dry weather. A local man discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking pool of water and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), organized a community rescue effort. The group successfully moved salmon, trout, and other species to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the residents felt they had no choice but to act.</p>
