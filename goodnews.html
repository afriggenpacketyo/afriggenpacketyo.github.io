          <p>Economists are expressing mixed views on Sanae Takaichi, who is poised to become Japan's next prime minister. Her proposed expansionary fiscal policies are seen as a potential driver for economic growth, but they also raise significant concerns about increasing the country's already strained budget deficit and national debt. While Takaichi has favored a dovish monetary policy, her election could limit future interest rate hikes, creating a complex outlook for Japan's economy. The analysis suggests a trade-off between short-term stimulus and long-term fiscal stability.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will permanently remain as the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service after taking on the role temporarily. The decision, made by President Trump, is unusual as no prior Treasury secretary has simultaneously led the IRS.

This leadership structure aims to maintain stability and operational control at the tax collection agency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed forgiving student debt for borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, a program that had been partially paused since July. Borrowers who have been making payments for 20 to 25 years are now receiving notices of debt cancellation. The pause was initiated to assess payment counts following court actions that blocked the separate SAVE plan. The resumption of IBR discharges provides relief for thousands of long-term borrowers, although advocates note that backlogs remain for other forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness.</p>

          <p>Japanese brewer Asahi has partially restarted production at all six of its breweries in the country after a cyberattack forced a complete shutdown. The attack crippled the company's ordering and delivery systems, leading to shortages of popular beers like Asahi Super Dry at major retailers. While production of its flagship beer has resumed, the plants are not yet fully operational, and the company has also had to postpone some new product launches. The incident is the latest example of a major corporation's operations being severely disrupted by a cyber-attack.</p>

This arrangement treats the caregiving provided by older relatives as essential, compensated labor, which can provide financial support for grandparents and affordable, reliable care for working parents. The piece argues that adopting a similar model could strengthen intergenerational bonds and create more stable, communal family units, challenging American norms around financial independence and family obligations.</p>

The physician, Dr. Tsion Firew, sent her young children to another country for their safety while she treated infected colleagues, many of whom died in the initial days. However, Rwanda's swift, science-based public health response, which included rapid testing and the pioneering use of experimental treatments, resulted in the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak. Her story highlights both the personal sacrifices of healthcare workers and the remarkable success of a well-executed crisis response.</p>

These cells act as a security force to prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues. Their research has opened a new field of immunology and is fundamental to developing treatments for autoimmune diseases.</p>
