          <p>Liverpool has finalized the signing of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record fee of £125 million, which could potentially rise to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old completed his medical and signed a six-year contract, expressing his motivation to "create history and win trophies" with the club. The deal was announced on the final day of the transfer window, concluding a lengthy negotiation process after an initial £110 million offer was rejected in August. Isak's arrival at Anfield marks a major acquisition for the Premier League team.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after being filmed snatching a hat intended for a young boy from tennis player Kamil Majchrzak at the US Open. Szczerek claimed he made a "huge mistake" and was convinced the player was passing the hat to him, stating it was not his intention to take a souvenir from a child. The video of the incident was widely shared and criticized on social media. Majchrzak later met with the young fan to give him a new cap and other merchandise, resolving the situation amicably.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Aston Villa has successfully completed a season-long loan deal for Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho. The agreement stipulates that Villa will cover at least 80% of Sancho's significant weekly wages, with bonuses expected to cover the full amount for Manchester United. The 25-year-old England international, who joined United for £73 million four years ago, has not played for the club since August 2024. This move follows previous loan spells at Borussia Dortmund and Chelsea, and it provides Sancho with a new opportunity to play in the Premier League after turning down a move to Roma earlier in the transfer window.</p>

Osaka played a patient and powerful game, capitalizing on unforced errors from Gauff, who appeared to struggle with pressure on her home court.

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a bilateral meeting in China, reinforcing their countries' strong relationship amid strained India-U.S. relations. The meeting occurred days after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Indian imports as a response to India's continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Modi described the partnership with Moscow as "special and privileged," while Putin hailed the ties as friendly and trusting. This diplomatic engagement highlights India's strategy of maintaining its strategic autonomy and balancing relationships with global powers in a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the crisis in Kerr's life following his first professional loss, which triggered struggles with substance abuse and personal relationships. Johnson's performance, supported by facial prosthetics, is a central focus of the film, which also co-stars Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend. The review notes the film is a solid drama that captures Kerr's moments of vulnerability but may not fully explore the emotional depths of his story.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has confirmed that his team for the upcoming event at Bethpage will feature 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. However, he warned against expecting a "rinse and repeat" performance, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a different challenge requiring a new strategy. Donald noted that Europe has not won a Ryder Cup in the U.S. since 2012 and that he will adapt pairings and lineups accordingly. He also urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The move comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school libraries under a new provincial directive to eliminate materials with "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically describes perfectly chaste characters to critique the policy and its supporter, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith. This action is part of a growing resistance to the ban, which has affected numerous classic works of literature in the province's schools.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, driven by positive developments in the defense and healthcare sectors. A significant £10 billion warship export deal between the U.K. and Norway caused shares in defense companies like BAE Systems to rise. In pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk shares increased after trial data suggested its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than its competitors. These corporate news items contributed to a positive trading session, while U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. (not investment advice)</p>
