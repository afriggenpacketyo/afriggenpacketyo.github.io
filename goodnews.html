        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants receiving the drug, marking a significant advancement in HIV prevention. Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV, expressing optimism about potentially ending the epidemic. However, concerns have been raised about the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which experts warn could set back progress by a decade. The article highlights the ongoing need for a vaccine despite the approval of lenacapavir.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is implementing a five-pronged policy to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including building an $8.5 million fly dispersal facility in Texas. This facility will breed millions of sterile screwworm flies to mate with fertile flies, preventing them from laying eggs in open wounds, which can cause deadly infestations. The USDA also plans to convert a fruit fly breeding facility near Mexico's border into a screwworm fly breeding center. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the U.S.'s commitment to eradicating screwworms, which were largely banished from the country in the 1960s, and the new facility aims to protect the American cattle herd from this devastating pest.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and leaving the scene of a collision in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The jury did convict Read of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol (OUI), resulting in a one-year probation order. The trial garnered significant public attention, leading to a Hulu show, podcasts, and a Netflix documentary. Read maintained her innocence, claiming she was framed for O'Keefe's death, while the O'Keefe family expressed disappointment, alleging lies and conspiracy theories influenced the prosecution.</p>

          <p>A California appeals court upheld a $1 million jury verdict against the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect a middle school student from bullying. Eleri Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging she was subjected to verbal and cyber bullying by three students from November 2017 to June 2018. The court found the district negligent in supervising and training its employees, which contributed to the harm suffered by Irons. The appeals court rejected the district's arguments that it was immune to liability and that Irons failed to prove injuries were caused by employee negligence.</p>
