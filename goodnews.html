          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit the use of COVID vaccines by adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions in the fall, but may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders indicated that the additional doses offer ‚Äúuncertain‚Äù benefits to many young and middle-aged individuals who have already been vaccinated or have had COVID. The FDA anticipates the need for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. Some experts have expressed concern that the new criteria are overly restrictive and will deny the vaccine to many people who want it.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using food stamps, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), starting in January 2026. This marks the first time the federal government has approved such a waiver after rejecting similar efforts from states for two decades. The state will survey participants and examine retailer data to evaluate changes in spending habits. This decision signals a shift in nutrition policy, with other states like Iowa and Arkansas seeking similar waivers. Past resistance to these restrictions stemmed from concerns about feasibility and effectiveness, but the current administration views it as a way to promote healthier choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced plans for his "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, aiming to complete the ambitious project by the end of his term. The project, intended to protect against foreign missile threats, is estimated to cost between $175 billion and $542 billion. Trump expressed confidence in completing the project within three years, highlighting Canada's potential participation. The Golden Dome is designed to intercept missiles from any location, including space, and is overseen by Gen. Michael Guetlein of the Space Force. This initiative echoes President Reagan's "Star Wars" program, though experts note the technical and financial challenges of defending the vast U.S. territory.</p>

General Michael Guetlein of the US Space Force will oversee the implementation of the project. The selection of Guetlein, a four-star general with extensive experience in missile defense systems, indicates the importance placed on this initiative.</p>

Toyota, a leader in hybrid technology since the late 1990s, is responding to growing customer demand for hybrid vehicles. The decision reflects a broader trend in the automotive industry, where automakers are increasingly turning to hybrid models to meet fuel economy regulations and enhance performance.

          <p>Taku Eto has resigned as Japan's farm minister following controversy over comments that he does not buy rice because he receives it from supporters, sparking public anger amidst rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided to appoint former environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi as Eto's replacement. Eto's remarks came shortly after the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries decided to release additional rice from emergency stockpiles to lower prices, which have doubled in the past year. Eto, a leading expert on agricultural policy, previously served as farm minister under former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>

          <p>Japan's Agriculture Minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public backlash over a remark he made regarding rice. Eto stated that he had "never had to buy rice" because supporters gave it to him, a statement that was considered insensitive given the current rice shortage and soaring prices in the country. Rice is a staple food in Japan, and Eto's comment was particularly ill-timed as the government has been implementing measures to curb rising prices. Public support for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has also declined sharply, with a poll indicating that most respondents view the government's response to rising rice prices as inadequate.</p>

The NFL's executive vice president of communications, however, stated that data does not support the claim that the play is unsafe. Despite the debate, some players, like Eagles center Jason Kelce, do not believe the play is inherently dangerous.

The vaccine, a meningitis B vaccine, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea, which has seen a surge in cases, with over 85,000 in 2023. The NHS hopes this will reduce infections and combat antibiotic-resistant strains. Although not designed for gonorrhoea, the vaccine has been recommended by the JCVI and will be offered through sexual health services. This initiative marks a significant step in sexual health, potentially preventing thousands of cases and saving the NHS millions.</p>
