          <p>Bangladesh's interim government has announced that the next general election will be held in the first half of April 2026. This announcement follows student-led unrest in 2024 that led to the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who is currently being tried in absentia for her government's crackdown on protests. Opposition parties have been demanding a clear timeline for a democratic transition and have warned of potential instability if the vote is not held by December. BNP leader Khaleda Zia is eligible to run after being acquitted in a 2008 corruption case.</p>
