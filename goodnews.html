          <p>An opinion article discusses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the current arrangements are set to expire. The author recounts initial lack of concern in the 1970s due to Beijing's disavowal of unequal treaties, but notes the importance of addressing the issue, especially concerning property mortgages and land leases. The piece urges calm and forward-thinking rather than alarmism, emphasizing the need for law students to prepare for potential shifts towards mainland law. The article underscores the necessity for Hong Kong to proactively address its future legal framework to maintain stability and investor confidence.</p>

          <p>Poland began voting in a pivotal presidential election that is set to determine the country's direction on key issues like abortion rights, LGBTQ protections, and its relationship with the European Union. The front-runners are pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, with polls indicating a likely runoff between the two. The election occurs amidst ongoing political friction between the Polish prime minister and the conservative outgoing president, Andrzej Duda, potentially easing gridlock if Trzaskowski wins. A far-right candidate, S≈Çawomir Mentzen, could also play a significant role in the second round.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey revealed that the approval rating for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet has hit a record low of 27.4 percent.

          <h2>German Military Study Reexamines Extremism Within Its Ranks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new internal study by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that the German military does not have "systemic" extremism, with only a small percentage of soldiers displaying right-wing extremist views. However, the study also found problematic chauvinist and xenophobic attitudes among some soldiers. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, pointing to past incidents involving far-right networks within the military and suggesting that the voluntary nature of the survey may underestimate the true extent of the problem. The article balances the study's findings with concerns about the normalization of right-wing attitudes in broader German society.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of night train travel in Europe with the declining state of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and convenience. In contrast, the U.S. faces underfunded infrastructure and a car-centric culture, hindering the development of efficient rail systems. The article argues for investment in rail networks to improve connectivity, reduce car dependence, and offer a more sustainable travel option, highlighting the social and environmental benefits of trains.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance large infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves Chinese companies receiving long-term operating rights in exchange for funding and constructing projects, such as highways and railways. This approach addresses African governments' debt concerns and sustains infrastructure development. For example, Kenya is seeking Chinese funding to extend its Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) using a PPP model, where Chinese financiers contribute a significant portion of the investment and gain exclusive construction and operating rights for an extended period.</p>
