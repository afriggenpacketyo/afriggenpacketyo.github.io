        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As some certificates of deposit (CDs) are set to mature in November, savers are advised to act proactively in a shifting interest rate environment. With the Federal Reserve having recently cut its benchmark rate, CD yields are beginning to soften from their 2023 highs. The article suggests that account holders should review their bank's maturity notices, shop around for competitive rates on new CDs or high-yield savings accounts, and consider whether the liquidity of a savings account might be more beneficial than locking into a new, potentially lower-yield CD.

Now serving the Archdiocese of Newark, Bishop Bismarck intends to focus on supporting the immigrant community, aiming to be a "voice for the voiceless" and connect them with essential resources, drawing from his own journey from fear to faith.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, homeowners with high mortgage rates are evaluating refinancing options. While experts often suggest refinancing for a full percentage point drop, even a smaller reduction could be beneficial for those who purchased homes after 2022. Current average 30-year refinance rates are around 6.51%, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or buying mortgage points could secure even lower rates for homeowners. With more Fed cuts anticipated, the environment for refinancing may become increasingly favorable in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

This growth is further supported by a massive lease agreement with CoreWeave and plans for a second campus in North Dakota, positioning the company to capitalize on the billions being invested in AI deployment.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicha music, a uniquely Peruvian genre, represents a complex fusion of cultural identity, born from the mass migrations of Andean Indigenous peoples to Lima. The sound blends Colombian cumbia, Cuban guaracha, Andean huayno, and psychedelic rock, with the electric guitar as its centerpiece, pioneered by artists like Manzanita and Los Destellos. While the term "chicha" itself has been controversial, the music became a powerful voice for marginalized migrant communities in the 1980s through icons like Chacalón, and its cultural resonance continues to thrive in Peru's capital today.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Labor Department will temporarily recall staff to complete and release the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The decision was made because the Social Security Administration requires the inflation data to calculate its annual cost-of-living adjustments for beneficiaries, which must be published before November 1. While the crucial CPI report will be published, other key economic data releases, such as the nonfarm payroll report, remain delayed due to the funding lapse in Washington.</p>
