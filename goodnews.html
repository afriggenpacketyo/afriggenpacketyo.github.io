          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 12:10:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling, which grants a preliminary injunction and certifies the challenge as a class-action lawsuit, follows a recent Supreme Court decision that limited nationwide injunctions but allowed for class-action relief. The judge stated that the petitioners, including pregnant immigrants and their families, would likely suffer irreparable harm if the order was enforced. The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision as a significant victory for protecting the constitutional rights of all children born in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has initiated discussions with Nottingham Forest to potentially sign midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White in a deal that could be valued at £60 million. According to sources, the 25-year-old English player has a release clause for this amount, and a move is expected to gain momentum soon. Gibbs-White, who was previously on Manchester City's radar, had a strong season with seven goals and eight assists. The potential transfer comes as Forest is not under financial pressure to sell, having recently agreed to a major transfer for another player.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, entrepreneur Jared Isaacman. The President cited Isaacman's Democratic political donations and his close professional ties to Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has significant NASA contracts, as reasons for pulling the nomination. Duffy, who will serve in a dual-hatted role, expressed his honor in accepting the position at a critical time for the agency, which is focused on lunar missions and future human exploration of Mars. The move highlights a growing trend of dual appointments within the administration.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has charged seven Chinese nationals for their alleged involvement in a multi-million dollar marijuana trafficking operation across the Northeast, primarily in Massachusetts and Maine. Authorities arrested six of the individuals, with one remaining at large. The criminal enterprise allegedly smuggled migrants across the U.S.-Mexico border to work in illegal grow houses, withholding their passports until their smuggling debts were repaid. Searches of the properties uncovered large quantities of marijuana, over $470,000 in cash, Chinese passports, and luxury items, including a Rolex watch.</p>

This transparency measure, which also applies to force-fed foie gras, aims to inform consumers about standard yet cruel practices in global animal agriculture. While Swiss farmers must use pain relief for such procedures, the country still imports products from nations where this is not required. The law is an experiment in consumer awareness, treating certain meat production methods like a vice, similar to how tobacco products are labeled, to see if it influences purchasing habits and pushes the industry toward more humane practices.</p>

A California-based company did conduct a small cloud seeding operation 150 miles away two days before the floods, but meteorologists state the technique is incapable of creating or significantly intensifying a storm of such magnitude. The deluge was actually caused by a convergence of storms with remnants of a tropical system.

This marks the first time an identifiable ruler's resting place has been found at the major archaeological site. The tomb, dating to around A.D. 350, contained the ruler's remains along with numerous artifacts, including 11 pottery vessels, a jadeite death mask, and carved bone tubes. The discovery provides crucial insights into the city's dynastic history and suggests that early Mayan leaders had extensive contact with the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan earlier than previously believed.</p>

The country's capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and its flag closely resembles the American flag. This shared heritage, which includes ten U.S.-born Liberian presidents, explains the cultural and linguistic ties that might have seemed surprising to President Trump but are fundamental to Liberia's identity.</p>
