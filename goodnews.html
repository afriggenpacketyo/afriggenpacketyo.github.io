          <p>Candidates for California's 2026 gubernatorial race are outlining their platforms, offering both praise and criticism for Governor Gavin Newsom's tenure. Democrats like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra highlighted Newsom's economic management and resistance to the Trump administration, while proposing faster action on housing and infrastructure. Republicans such as Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton criticized Newsom's policies, with Hilton agreeing only on limiting smartphone use in schools. The diverse field, including candidates from the Green Party, is focusing on key state issues like healthcare, housing costs, and fiscal accountability, setting the stage for a competitive election.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index reached a historic milestone, closing above the 45,000 mark for the first time and leading gains across Asia-Pacific markets. The surge was reportedly fueled by investor optimism following President Trump's positive comments on U.S.-China trade negotiations and a framework deal concerning the divestment of TikTok. Other major indexes, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the U.S. S&P 500, also saw gains, reflecting a broad-based confidence in the market ahead of a key U.S. Federal Reserve meeting.

These struggles, which made it difficult to rent an apartment or secure a car loan, inspired her to co-found TomoCredit. The San Francisco-based fintech startup is designed to help immigrants and others with limited credit histories build their financial standing. Last year, her company, which offers a credit card that doesn't require a traditional credit score for approval, generated over $20 million in revenue.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is preparing to receive a significant volume of backlogged U.S. arms orders, which is expected to bolster its defense capabilities against increasing threats from Beijing. According to reports from the island's defense ministry, nearly $4.5 billion worth of systems are currently being delivered out of a total backlog of over $21.5 billion. However, some key procurements, such as the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon and the F-16V fighter jets, have faced substantial delays due to production and testing issues. Despite these setbacks, the influx of military hardware marks a critical step in strengthening Taiwan's deterrence posture.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled to prevent President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to participate in an upcoming key interest rate vote. The divided court upheld a lower court's decision, finding that her removal would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to ensure the central bank's political independence. The Trump administration sought to remove Cook based on unproven mortgage fraud allegations, a move critics see as part of a broader effort to exert political control over the Fed's monetary policy. This legal battle underscores the ongoing tensions between the White House and the independent central bank.</p>

          <p>In an interview about his new memoir, "Night People," producer and DJ Mark Ronson reflects on his early career in New York's 1990s hip-hop scene. He recounts DJing for music legends like Prince and Mariah Carey, and how the instability of his childhood drew him to the control and refuge of the DJ booth. Ronson explains how navigating delicate situations in clubs later helped his work as a producer, such as when he calmly defused the tension after Lady Gaga accidentally crashed into his car before a recording session. His book focuses on this formative period, which predates his mainstream success with artists like Amy Winehouse and Bruno Mars.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Four Key Strategies for an Effective Autumn Home Declutter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn begins, many people feel motivated to tidy their homes, a process that psychologists say can reduce stress and increase energy. Experts recommend four main strategies for successful decluttering: start small with a single drawer, plan ahead where to donate or sell items, and prioritize keeping quality objects that bring joy rather than a large quantity of things. A crucial tip is to distinguish between sentimentality for an object and nostalgia for the past it represents, which can make it easier to let go. This mindful approach helps make the task manageable and prevents feeling overwhelmed.</p>

          <p>The FDA is re-evaluating the risks and benefits of menopause hormone therapy, considering the removal of "black box" warnings that list risks of stroke, dementia, and breast cancer. Many doctors argue these warnings are based on flawed, decades-old research that focused on older women and overstated the dangers for those who start treatment around the onset of menopause. More recent studies suggest that for many women, the therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms like hot flashes, and risks can be mitigated based on age and dosage. However, some experts urge caution, calling for more scientific assessment before any label changes are made.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer pushed back against the idea that the best days are over for the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, which include Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia. He argued that these companies continue to be strong investments due to their great management, vast cash reserves, and enormous scale, which makes them difficult for competitors to challenge. Citing examples of innovation like Apple Watch's new health features and Meta's successful acquisitions, Cramer suggested that these giants are constantly evolving. He believes that as long as their core strengths remain, their valuations are compelling and their growth potential is still significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, an idea the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now reportedly reviewing. Trump argued the change would save companies money and encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits, contrasting the U.S. system with what he described as China's longer-term view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized the focus on quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors. The proposed change could be implemented by the SEC without congressional approval. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal is to understand why the area consistently ranks among California's dirtiest beaches and to determine if a man-made breakwater built in the 1930s is trapping pollutants by hindering water flow. By tracking the dye's movement, scientists hope to gather data that can inform solutions to improve the bay's water quality.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" for a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., avoiding a potential ban. The app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has faced scrutiny over concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data or use the platform for propaganda. While details are still scarce, any agreement would require the sale of TikTok to a U.S.-based entity to address these national security concerns. The move comes ahead of a new deadline for a ban, with President Trump scheduled to discuss the terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
