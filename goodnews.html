          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, following a retrial that concluded nearly a year after her first prosecution ended in a mistrial; she was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death. The jury, however, found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, resulting in a one-year probation sentence. Read thanked her supporters and stated that no one fought harder for justice for John O'Keefe than she and her team. Following the verdict, witnesses who testified against Read expressed their disappointment, calling the result a devastating miscarriage of justice. The optimism score is self-contained and represents a condensed view of sentiment analysis.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Gilead's lenacapavir injection, marketed as Yeztugo, for HIV prevention, a twice-yearly antiviral injection. Clinical trials demonstrated the injection's ability to virtually eliminate new HIV infections when taken every six months, proving to be more effective than daily pills. The annual list price for Yeztugo is $28,218 in the U.S. before insurance, with programs available to reduce out-of-pocket costs for eligible patients. Gilead has also granted licenses to generic manufacturers to produce lower-cost versions for low- and lower-middle-income countries, committing to supply doses for up to 2 million people at no profit before generic versions become available, with the hope of bending the arc of the epidemic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts in radiation hazards have assessed the potential consequences of a U.S. strike using a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. They believe the risk of widespread contamination is low, as the uranium hexafluoride gas processed at the site is heavy and unlikely to travel far. Any contamination would likely remain localized, posing minimal risk to those outside the immediate area. While hydrofluoric acid could form if the gas reacts with water, the underground location and collapsing mountain would inhibit its release.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to maintain its benchmark interest rate, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach amidst the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down economic growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>
