The article notes that governor Andrew Bailey said the slowdown in inflation was behind the cut, but warned recent weeks had shown "how unpredictable the global economy can be" with the US introducing wide-ranging tariffs. The article also discusses the impact of the rate cut on borrowers and savers, as well as the Bank's expectations for future rate cuts and UK economic growth. The article states that US tariffs were also set to slow inflation, the Bank added, due to the impact of them on global trade leading to lower fossil fuel prices and the likely diversion of cheap goods from Asia to Europe which had originally been slated for America.</p>
