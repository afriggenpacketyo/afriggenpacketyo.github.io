          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, citing the illegality of gambling with overseas-based betting sites in Japan. The government aims to address the issue by urging operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are provided in Japanese. This move follows media revelations of some professional athletes and celebrities using online casinos, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. Japan is also expected to enact a law to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies that boosted consumption. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. Fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7% year-to-date, with a deepening contraction in property investment. The rise in retail sales is attributed to the ongoing consumer goods trade-in program and a surge in online shopping, though falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment.
