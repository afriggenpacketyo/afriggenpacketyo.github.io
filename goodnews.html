          <p>Swedish journalist Joakim Medin, who was jailed in Turkey for "insulting" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has been released. Medin was arrested upon arrival in Istanbul while covering protests triggered by the arrest of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. He received an 11-month suspended sentence for "insulting the president" and faced additional terrorism charges, which he refuted. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European colleagues for their efforts in securing Medin's release.</p>

          <p>A House amendment allowing the sale of 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah faces opposition from Republican Representative Ryan Zinke, jeopardizing President Trump's budget bill. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's proposal to sell public lands to address the affordable housing crisis is criticized for its shortsightedness. Conservation advocates argue that public lands have enduring value and should be protected for future generations. The amendment has sparked debate over the balance between economic interests and preserving America's shared natural resources and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Fujirebio's blood test for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in some patients, allowing for wider availability. The test measures proteins in the blood associated with amyloid plaques, a key indicator of Alzheimer's. It is intended for adults 55 and older with cognitive decline, and its accuracy was validated against brain scans and spinal fluid tests. The approval comes after concerns about unregulated blood tests for Alzheimer's, with the FDA seeking stricter oversight of laboratory-developed tests. This approval aims to provide earlier and more accessible diagnosis of Alzheimer's.</p>

          <p>The Illinois House passed legislation on Thursday requiring more thorough background checks before police officers are hired, less than a year after a Sangamon County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed Sonya Massey. Law enforcement agencies would not be allowed to make a final job offer for police officers without first inspecting all of their prior employment records. Anyone applying for a police officer job in Illinois would be required to authorize all previous employers, including other law enforcement agencies, to provide full employment records. The legislation was passed unanimously by the Illinois Senate last month, and will go to Gov. JB Pritzker's desk.</p>
