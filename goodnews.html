          <p>Friedrich Merz was elected as Germany's next chancellor after an initial defeat in parliament, marking an unprecedented event in post-war German history. Merz initially fell short of the required majority, causing confusion and uncertainty. A second vote was held where he secured a majority of nine votes, averting a potential crisis for his Christian Democrats and their coalition with the Social Democrats. Merz will be sworn in by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, assuming office with his team of 17 ministers. The article highlights the political tensions and the importance of a strong Germany for Europe.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement aimed at boosting trade between the two countries by an estimated ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040. The agreement will reduce tariffs on UK exports such as whisky and cars to India, and on Indian clothing and footwear exports to the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a landmark achievement that will stimulate growth and benefit British businesses and consumers. The agreement also includes provisions for the services sector and procurement, enabling British firms to compete for more contracts.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge, fueled by speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwan dollar is still up over 8% against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts attribute the dramatic swings to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings. While Taiwan's central bank denies that exchange rates were part of trade negotiations with the U.S., analysts remain skeptical.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missing payments on a HELOC can lead to late fees, a damaged credit score, and even foreclosure. Late fees can range from $25 to $50, and a single missed payment can significantly drop your FICO score. Repeated late payments may result in default, where the lender demands the full balance immediately. In severe cases, lenders may initiate foreclosure proceedings. Experts recommend contacting your lender immediately if you're having trouble with payments to explore options like forbearance or payment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that the shingles vaccine may offer additional health benefits by reducing the risk of heart disease. A study found that individuals who received the vaccine had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly noticeable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on heart health may be due to preventing blood vessel damage and inflammation caused by the shingles infection.</p>

          <p>Generations of deep-diving among women on a South Korean Island may have resulted in genetic evolution. Haenyeo, or ‚Äúsea women‚Äù, are Korean cultural divers who have developed unique adaptations allowing them to dive for longer periods than other people. The inhabitants of the island appear to have developed lower blood pressure and cold tolerance, traits that could help science develop new medical treatments in the future.
