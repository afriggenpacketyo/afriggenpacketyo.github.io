          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, primarily driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units. The company's revenue reached $3.8 billion, significantly exceeding market expectations, although sales from its IP-related business saw a slight decline. Despite this strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its conservative full-year guidance, even as analysts predict sales will surpass targets despite potential impacts from U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the country's Atlantic region, with numbers growing to around 1,600 animals across 209 packs.

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase representation from working-class families within Whitehall. Successful interns on the paid, six-to-eight-week program will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate scheme, as part of a broader effort to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves.</p>

The legislation is named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old who was fatally stabbed with such a weapon in 2022 in a case of mistaken identity. His mother, Pooja Kanda, who campaigned relentlessly for the ban, called its passage a bittersweet moment, believing it will save lives but came too late to save her son.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, the Rhisotope Project, involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes to deter trafficking. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports, leading to the arrest of poachers. Following successful trials, researchers confirmed the method is safe for the animals and effective at triggering alarms, offering a novel strategy to protect the world's declining rhino population.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's process for handling a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional gridlock, which naturally leads to more legal challenges requiring urgent court intervention. He asserted that the court has adapted by increasing its written explanations and scheduling emergency arguments, and he emphasized the collegiality among the justices despite differing views.</p>
