This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes. Customers are urged to return the product for a full refund or discard it.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to lower elevated rice prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, addressing shortages and suspected hoarding by wholesalers and farmers. The government aims to quickly deliver the rice to consumers at lower prices.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a warning about an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. A survey of 14,000 people in 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of people as a reason for not having more children, while infertility was cited by 12%. This marks a shift in focus for the UN, which has historically emphasized issues related to women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a massive reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z. Data from the CDC shows a 47% reduction in overdose risk for those aged 20-29. This shift is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl, more addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens. While the trend is promising, experts caution that many still struggle with addiction and that cuts in funding for addiction services could reverse the progress.</p>
