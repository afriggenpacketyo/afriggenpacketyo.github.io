        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional concept of a midlife crisis, involving drastic changes like buying a sports car or leaving one's family, doesn't resonate with millennials entering their 40s. Instead, they face a progress report, often lacking the stability previous generations had and seeking opportunities for personal growth. Many millennials find themselves reevaluating their careers and lives, impacted by economic factors like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the challenges, there's a sense of optimism and a focus on self-discovery and creating a fulfilling life. The optimism score reflects the potential for positive change and growth despite the challenges.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to exit polls. Lee's win would position him as the next leader after the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, influencing South Korea's trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies on China and North Korea. While Lee had shifted his stance to the political center, he is expected to pursue a more left-leaning agenda, focusing on economic revival and tariff negotiations with the U.S. The optimism score reflects the potential for policy changes and economic impacts following the election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Constitutional Court rejected a challenge by the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) to the results of February's parliamentary elections. The BSW narrowly missed the 5% threshold required for representation in the Bundestag, arguing that its ballot placement and the failure to carry out a recount violated its right to equal opportunity. The court dismissed the arguments, stating that the party did not sufficiently substantiate the possibility of a violation of its rights. If the BSW had overcome the hurdle, the new coalition government would not have had a majority. The optimism score reflects the stability of the political system despite the challenge.</p>
