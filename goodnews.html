          <p>A top state regulator, Jordan Maynard, has characterized the booming US gambling industry as a "highway without speed limits" and is urging lawmakers to consider nationwide regulations on advertising by betting firms. He also suggests that nationwide exclusion lists for problem gamblers are needed to prevent them from circumventing state-level restrictions. Maynard believes that regulators should ensure that the industry is held to high standards and that patrons are protected from harm. He also stated that he is not thinking about big business, but rather the patrons and citizens of Massachusetts.</p>
