          <p>The debate over whether seed oils like canola, soybean, and sunflower oil are beneficial or harmful to health continues, with prominent figures and researchers holding opposing views. Health Secretary RFK Jr. has publicly claimed that these oils are "poisoning Americans," contributing to a popular narrative that they cause chronic inflammation. However, many nutrition researchers and mainstream health organizations contest these claims, arguing that the scientific evidence does not support such a strong condemnation. They often point to studies showing that, when used in place of saturated fats, these polyunsaturated fats can be part of a healthy diet.</p>

          <p>Despite potential headwinds from U.S. export blocks to China, analysts suggest Nvidia remains a premier investment choice among the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks for the second half of the year. The company's deep integration across all stages of artificial intelligence development, from powering major tech platforms to future applications in robotics, solidifies its long-term growth potential. While the China situation presents a challenge, Nvidia's primary revenue streams are in the U.S. and other markets. Furthermore, its current valuation is considered more reasonable than in previous months, potentially offering significant room for growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has found a buyer for the popular video-sharing app TikTok, which faces a U.S. ban over national security concerns. In a Fox News interview, Trump mentioned a group of "very wealthy people" were prepared to acquire the platform, with more details to be revealed in the coming weeks. A potential sale would require approval from the Chinese government, which Trump believes is likely. This development comes after the president delayed for a third time the enforcement of a law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app.</p>
