          <p>Hims & Hers Health has announced its acquisition of Zava, a European telehealth platform, as part of its global expansion strategy. The deal, expected to close by mid-year, will extend Hims & Hers' services to Ireland, France, and Germany, increasing its active customer base by roughly 50% with 1.3 million new customers. Zava CEO David Meinertz noted the acquisition will help alleviate the strain on the overwhelmed European healthcare system, as the medications are priced more competitively than in the U.S. The company plans to maintain the Zava branding for a few quarters before rebranding as Hims & Hers.</p>

          <p>Luang Prabang, Laos, has experienced an economic boom driven by tourism, leading to a significant reduction in poverty, with officials reporting that 98.3% of the city's population is no longer considered poor. The city attracted over 2 million visitors last year, generating $560 million in revenue. However, Laos as a whole still struggles with poverty, high public debt, and reliance on agriculture, with concerns that some tourism models, such as "zero-dollar" tours, do not benefit the local population. Experts suggest that a combination of tourism, improved agriculture, and logistics could help Laos alleviate poverty nationwide.</p>

          <p>Meta has entered into a 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase 1.1 gigawatts of nuclear power from the Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois. This long-term agreement will support the continued operation and relicensing of the plant, which was at risk of closing when its zero-emissions credit expired. The deal will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts, contributing to Meta's goal of 100% clean electricity. Constellation's president and CEO, Joe Dominguez, emphasized the importance of supporting existing nuclear plants as part of the journey towards new energy sources.</p>

          <p>Millennials entering their 40s are experiencing midlife differently than previous generations, with economic instability and a focus on self-expression shaping their experiences. Unlike the traditional midlife crisis stereotypes, millennials are often seeking opportunities for personal growth and reevaluation rather than dramatic life changes. Factors such as the financial crisis of 2008 and the Covid-19 pandemic have contributed to a sense of uncertainty and a reevaluation of career and life goals. This generation is also more open to exploring new identities and embracing change.</p>
