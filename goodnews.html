          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly the last minister yet to finalize a funding agreement with the Treasury before the upcoming Spending Review. While police budgets are expected to increase in real terms over the next three years, negotiations continue regarding the wider Home Office budget. Other ministers, such as Housing Secretary Angela Rayner, have reached settlements after progress in negotiations. The Spending Review is set to outline budgets for government departments over the next few years, with potential increases for the NHS possibly leading to budget cuts in other areas.</p>
