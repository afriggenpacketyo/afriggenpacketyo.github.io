          <p>This article addresses recent claims by the Trump administration linking the painkiller Tylenol to rising autism rates. It consults with medical experts and researchers who state there is no scientific evidence to support a causal relationship, emphasizing that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with polygenetic origins. The piece also clarifies that the increase in autism diagnoses is largely attributed to improved diagnostic methods and greater public awareness, while reiterating the thoroughly debunked nature of any link between vaccines and autism.</p>

          <p>Shares for the Danish renewable energy firm Orsted experienced a significant surge of over 7% on Tuesday. This market enthusiasm followed a U.S. court decision that overturned a block previously imposed by the Trump administration, allowing Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. Located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, the offshore wind farm is a key project for the company in the American market. The ruling was a notable development for the embattled firm and boosted its stock performance on the European market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year, despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back low-carbon initiatives. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics highlights the sector's resilience and momentum, with significant financing directed toward wind power and electricity grids. Furthermore, a separate analysis shows that a majority of the world's largest companies are continuing to pursue their net-zero climate goals, indicating that corporate climate action is proceeding independently of hostile federal policies in the U.S.</p>

The structure is the tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam of its kind and is the world's first to be completed using comprehensive intelligent construction technologies. According to state media, the project leveraged artificial intelligence, digital twin modeling, and unmanned equipment to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges. This innovative approach, likened to 3D printing on a massive scale, represents a significant advancement in dam construction and automated engineering practices.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at the 1985 Ryder Cup, a pivotal moment that revived the competition after decades of American dominance. Forty years ago, European captain Tony Jacklin implemented significant changes, demanding better travel, attire, and team facilities to professionalize the European effort and instill a winning mentality. These reforms, combined with the inclusion of talents like Seve Ballesteros, led to a narrow loss in 1983 and a historic victory at The Belfry in 1985, ending a 28-year U.S. unbeaten streak. That win is credited with transforming the Ryder Cup into the highly competitive and popular global event it is today.</p>

          <p>Companies from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau are re-entering the offshore dollar bond market, pushing issuance to its highest point since 2022. Among them is struggling developer Seazen Group, which is pursuing a second bond deal after a successful offering earlier this year. This resurgence indicates that financing channels, largely closed during China's property crisis, are reopening as a changing interest-rate environment makes refinancing more attractive. This trend suggests a potential rebuilding of trust among global investors in sectors previously considered too risky for investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A much-anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to occur next year rather than this fall, according to U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Perdue stated that while a meeting could happen in the near future, it would "certainly" take place next year. His comments followed a recent phone call between the two leaders where Trump had suggested a meeting next month. Perdue emphasized that the relationship between the two presidents is currently "very good and very encouraging."</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, paediatrician Mike Freelander addresses the recent comments from the U.S. president linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) to autism, labeling them as worrying and unscientific. He emphasizes that for decades, medical regulators like the TGA in Australia have classified paracetamol as safe for use during pregnancy based on rigorous scientific evidence, with major studies disproving a causative effect. Freelander warns that such unsubstantiated claims cause significant distress and can lead to poor health outcomes if pregnant individuals avoid necessary medication. He urges the public to trust expert regulatory bodies over uninformed political statements.</p>

He stressed that with advancements in AI and cyberspace, the potential for misunderstandings is high.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which had been frozen over allegations of civil rights violations. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin ruled that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending the funds without providing specific details or following proper procedures. The funding freeze is part of a broader administration strategy to pressure elite universities over issues like campus antisemitism and diversity initiatives. The restored grants primarily support crucial medical research at the university.</p>

          <p>This article explores how modern football tactics, such as an increased emphasis on set-pieces and direct, long-ball play, are reminiscent of the style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce. Allardyce, once criticized for his methods, notes that many top clubs are now adopting strategies he pioneered, including using a big target-man striker and prioritizing forward passes over a possession-based game. The piece highlights a shift away from playing out from the back, with data showing more goals are now being scored from set-pieces. Allardyce suggests that coaches are becoming less fearful of criticism and more willing to innovate.</p>
