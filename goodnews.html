        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson have authored a new book, "Original Sin," which explores the emergence of concerns about Joe Biden's cognitive decline during his time in office. In a discussion on Washington Week With The Atlantic, Tapper noted a divergence between a "fine Joe Biden" and a "nonfunctioning Biden," with the latter becoming increasingly prevalent. The book delves into when these instances of cognitive decline became frequent enough to raise legitimate questions about his ability to serve as president. The discussion also involved Jeffrey Goldberg, providing context for the book's claims and its implications for Biden's legacy.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a strong competitor in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts attribute On's success to its unique shoe aesthetics and well-timed market entry, capitalizing on Nike's sales decline and Adidas's partnership issues. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market share, On's rapid earnings growth is outpacing both companies. The article notes that On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty surrounding tariffs, given that 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara implementing changes to improve safety and community relations. Despite shootings trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by officer shortages and diminished police force numbers. O'Hara focuses on "getting back to the basics," emphasizing crime reduction and community trust, and is working to restore pride in the profession and change the department's culture. The Justice Department is ending investigations of six police agencies, including Minneapolis, though reform efforts will continue despite the lack of federal oversight.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments, according to NHS England. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to provide immediate care for individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England highlights that these centers aim to expedite access to appropriate care, keeping people out of hospitals, while critics emphasize the need for thorough testing and proper funding. The scheme is part of a 10-year NHS plan and will include both new, self-contained units and integration into existing A&Es.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to David Marcus, a provision in the GOP's "big beautiful bill" that eliminates taxes on overtime could be politically advantageous for Republicans in the upcoming midterms. This policy change is reportedly highly desired by working Americans and employers, and could serve as a significant measure to gain support. Marcus argues that reducing overtime tax would be more impactful than stimulus checks, as it provides a consistent raise that workers can rely on. He suggests that Republicans should emphasize their commitment to eliminating overtime tax in their campaigns, as it addresses a key concern of the working class.</p>

          <p>A record number of Americans are seeking residency in the UK, with over 6,000 applications for British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain in the past year. The surge is partly attributed to the polarized political climate in the US under the Trump administration, with some immigration lawyers reporting increased inquiries following recent pronouncements. While the UK government aims to reduce overall immigration, there are provisions to expedite qualifications based on contributions made. Most applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links, with language requirements being emphasized for integration.</p>

General Atomics and Anduril are developing initial designs, with ground testing underway to assess propulsion, avionics, and autonomy integration.

          <p>President Trump is set to address the 2025 graduating class at West Point, marking his first military commencement address of his second term. This visit comes as West Point complies with the administration's executive order banning diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. The president's address follows Vice President Vance's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, emphasizing a shift in foreign policy against prolonged conflicts. Trump's last speech at West Point in 2020 was amidst nationwide unrest following George Floyd's death, and he focused on thanking the National Guard.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, could benefit investors but faces criticism over potential risks to the housing market. Skeptics warn that privatizing Fannie and Freddie could raise mortgage rates, while supporters argue it could generate significant revenue for the government. The Treasury Secretary stated that the effect on long-term mortgage rates would be a key consideration.</p>

          <p>The EU's trade chief, Maro≈° ≈†efƒçoviƒç, responded to Donald Trump's threat to impose a 50% tariff on all goods from the bloc, asserting that any trade deal must be based on respect, not threats. He emphasized the EU's commitment to securing a mutually beneficial agreement and its readiness to defend its interests. European politicians expressed disappointment, with France's trade minister, Laurent Saint-Martin, stating that threats do not aid negotiations. The EU is prepared to implement countermeasures, such as counter-tariffs, if negotiations fail.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a milestone in underwater communication technology. The team, led by Professor He Chengbing, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement has significant civilian and military applications, paving the way for long-range undersea messaging. The sea trials demonstrate the potential for reliable underwater communication over considerable distances.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain due to a rare condition called pericardial constriction, where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. Despite numerous tests, the cause remained elusive until cardiologist Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected the condition and recommended open-heart surgery. The surgery, performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi, revealed a thick shell of scarring trapping Mauceri's heart, which was then carefully removed. Following the procedure, Mauceri made a full recovery and returned to conducting, expressing gratitude for the medical team's life-saving intervention.</p>

The show, based on a play, offers a cynical take on the bought intimacies of the ultra-rich and contrasts the lives of Michaela's staff with her and her devotees, examining power dynamics and gender roles.</p>
