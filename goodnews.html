          <p>A Mexican Navy training sailboat, the Cuauht√©moc, carrying 277 people, struck the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in injuries to multiple individuals, including three critically injured. The incident prompted a brief closure of the bridge and an assessment of structural damage by the Department of Transportation. According to social media posts, the ship's tall masts snapped upon impact, and the vessel came to a halt at the Brooklyn Promenade. The Mexican secretariat of the navy stated they are reviewing the status of personnel and equipment and providing support, with the New York Police Department responding to the scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reportedly exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid labor such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes this would make community service more impactful and address the prison overcrowding crisis. Offenders would not receive wages, but the money earned would be allocated to a fund for victim's groups. This initiative aims to demonstrate that crime does not pay and to have offenders contribute to jobs that the public values.</p>

As a result, he is now banned from civil service, state-owned enterprises, and faces travel restrictions, a fine, and limitations on business and loan opportunities.

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, finished in 19th place despite possessing strong vocals and harmonies, drawing praise from former winner Conchita Wurst. The chief issue was the song itself, a "manic mish-mash of musical styles" that lacked consistency, though it showcased clever British touches. While the staging was fun and highlighted the band's friendship, it lacked the scale and impact of other performances. Despite the disappointing result, Remember Monday's performance laid a good foundation for future UK entries, with strong vocals and an infectious energy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on imported goods for potential price increases, urging the company to "eat the tariffs" instead. This comes after Walmart warned that prices on various items could rise despite reduced tariffs on China. Trump insisted that foreign producers should bear the cost of the tariffs and that companies should absorb the additional expenses. A Walmart spokesperson stated that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible given retail margins, as Trump's economic plan will eventually lead to more domestic jobs in manufacturing.</p>
