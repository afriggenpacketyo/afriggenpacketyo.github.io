          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to grow savings, with top accounts currently providing returns that outpace inflation. While national average yields for CDs are modest, online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs yielding over 4.40% APY. The current market features an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have better rates than long-term ones, making them an attractive option for savers looking to lock in high returns for a fixed period.

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and HELOCs present an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans and credit cards. As of mid-August, average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.41%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.13%, with the potential for these rates to decrease if the Federal Reserve issues cuts later this year. These products offer lower rates and potential tax deductions, but homeowners must be cautious as the home serves as collateral for the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old Glasgow student, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless individuals stay warm. Her concept, which uses solar panels to charge a battery pack that provides heat at night, won a national engineering competition and was developed into a working prototype by the firm Thales. Homeless Project Scotland is now using 35 of the devices in Glasgow, turning the young inventor's compassionate idea into a tangible solution for a pressing social issue.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, stated that both nations are prepared to advance their relationship beyond stabilization towards more productive economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, he highlighted the potential for a closer alignment between Australia's mining sector and China's manufacturing through joint exploration and technology sharing. This positive diplomatic signal follows a period of strained relations that saw Beijing impose export curbs on Australian goods, which were only lifted late last year, as the two countries seek to rebuild their significant trade partnership.</p>

The new deal would solidify Sky's dominance in UK golf broadcasting, as it already holds rights for all major tournaments, the Ryder Cup, and major professional tours. Netflix's credible offer signals its growing ambition in the live sports market, where it is selectively bidding for standalone global events to attract new subscribers to its streaming platform.</p>

Rossi, who claimed to be an Irish orphan named Arthur Knight, was extradited to the U.S. after being discovered in a Glasgow hospital. The jury deliberated for over eight hours before reaching its verdict in the case, which stemmed from an attack on a former fiancée in 2008. He now faces a sentence of five years to life in prison and has another trial for a separate sexual assault allegation scheduled for September.</p>
