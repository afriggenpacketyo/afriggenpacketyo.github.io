          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred while she was suspended over the audience performing her hit song "Roar." Videos show the singer was momentarily startled but quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption. After the song, Perry calmly remarked, "Not today, Satan," addressing the near-mishap with humor as the prop safely returned her to the stage.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Pros and Cons of Shortening Traditional Six-Week School Summer Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week summer school holiday and redistribute the break time throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help mitigate learning loss, ease childcare burdens and costs for working parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend that the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and that a shorter summer could concentrate travel demand, potentially driving up holiday prices further. The discussion reflects varied perspectives on student well-being, educational equity, and family economics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is signaling a policy shift aimed at encouraging savers to move money from low-interest cash accounts into stocks and shares investments. The government plans to send details of investment opportunities to savers and has not ruled out reducing the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the change. Proponents believe this could boost the economy and individual returns, but critics warn the push could backfire if new investors face market volatility. The debate also highlights a gender gap, as women are more likely to hold savings in cash than to invest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Veteran guard Marcus Smart is set to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The former Defensive Player of the Year is expected to sign a two-year, $11 million deal, filling a key need for a strong perimeter defender on the Lakers' roster. Smart, 31, is known for his toughness and defensive versatility, having made the NBA's All-Defensive first team three times. His addition is seen as a significant move to bolster the team's defensive capabilities alongside its offensive stars.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, 40, previously played for the Clippers for six seasons and would bring extensive experience and playmaking ability to the roster. The potential signing aligns with the team's strategy to add more ball-handling depth to support stars like James Harden. Frank emphasized that any new addition, including Paul, would need to accept a reserve role on the team as they build a roster to contend in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>After a period of rapid growth, interest in learning the Mandarin language appears to be waning across several Western countries, including the United States, the UK, and New Zealand. University enrollment in Mandarin courses in the U.S. has dropped by 25% from its peak in 2013, with similar downward trends seen in other nations. This decline suggests a significant shift in linguistic and cultural priorities in the West. While the precise reasons are multifaceted, this trend marks a notable reversal from when Mandarin was widely hailed as the global language of the future.</p>

The plan also aims to reduce phosphorus pollution and ban plastic-containing wet wipes. This comes amid intense scrutiny of water companies for paying large executive bonuses while environmental performance has faltered and consumer bills are set to rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The assassination attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," failed when a bomb planted in a briefcase only minorly injured Hitler, leading to the swift collapse of the coup. Stauffenberg and hundreds of co-conspirators were subsequently executed. Over the decades, the perception of the plotters has evolved from traitors to heroes in Germany, symbolizing the German resistance to Nazism, though historians note their complex motivations and late opposition to the regime.</p>
