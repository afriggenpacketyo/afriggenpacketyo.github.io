          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling Curbs Power of Lower Courts to Issue Nationwide Injunctions Against Trump Policies</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has significantly limited the ability of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a tool frequently used to block President Trump's policies. The administration highlighted that just five liberal-leaning district courts were responsible for the vast majority of the 40 universal injunctions issued against its agenda. This 6-3 ruling is being hailed by the administration as a major victory against what it termed "judicial overreach" that hampered executive authority. The decision addresses a dramatic increase in such injunctions, which far surpassed those faced by previous administrations combined.</p>

          <p>At 80 years old, Rod Stewart performed in Glastonbury's coveted "legends slot," delivering a 90-minute show filled with his classic hits and showmanship. The performance featured glittery suits, his former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood as a special guest, and a setlist including "Maggie May" and "Sailing." Despite his age and a recent illness, Stewart's energy was high, and he adapted his vocals to the current state of his famous gravelly voice. The show was a nostalgic and crowd-pleasing event, culminating in a dedication to Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis for his 90th birthday, reflecting a classic era of rock and roll.</p>

          <p>Jake Paul defeated former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by unanimous decision in a boxing match where Paul demonstrated improved skills against a professional fighter.

Paul, a YouTuber-turned-boxer, improved his record to 12-1 and stated the victory marked the beginning of the second chapter of his boxing career. The win helps legitimize his standing in the sport, as he continues to move from facing social media personalities to trained boxers.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by a lack of opportunities to unify her world titles in boxing, Mexican champion Kenia Enr√≠quez has signed an exclusive, multi-fight contract with the MMA organization Combate Global. Enr√≠quez, who holds interim titles from the World Boxing Council, accuses the boxing organization of deliberately preventing a unification bout against the current champion. Feeling disrespected and seeing her boxing career stagnate, she has decided to pursue a new path in mixed martial arts, where she has already made a successful debut. This move highlights the challenges some professional boxers face in securing high-profile fights within the sport's complex political landscape.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos's company, Blue Origin, successfully launched its 13th passenger flight, sending six more tourists to the edge of space and back on Sunday. The New Shepard rocket lifted off from West Texas, carrying the crew to an altitude just over 65 miles, past the internationally recognized boundary of space. Passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly to space, experienced about three minutes of weightlessness before their capsule parachuted safely back to Earth. The mission marks another step in the growing sub-orbital space tourism market, where Blue Origin currently operates without its main competitor, Virgin Galactic.</p>

          <p>Amid rising temperatures, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions to prevent heat-related illnesses, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise in hot weather than from being left in cars. Since dogs cannot sweat effectively, their body temperature can rise dangerously fast. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, suggesting instead early morning or late evening walks. A simple test is to place the back of your hand on the pavement; if it's too hot for you, it's too hot for your dog's paws.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operations to a "group of very wealthy people," with details to be revealed in about two weeks. The sale is intended to address U.S. national security concerns that the Chinese government could access American user data through TikTok's parent company, ByteDance. The president, who has extended the deadline for the sale multiple times, indicated that he believes the deal will likely receive the necessary approval from China's President Xi Jinping.

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its Ernie generative AI model open source, a significant move that could disrupt the global AI market. This decision puts Baidu in direct competition with both proprietary models from companies like OpenAI and other open-source leaders like DeepSeek. Analysts suggest the move could drastically lower costs for developers, with some calling it a "declaration of war on pricing" as Baidu claims its models offer comparable performance at a fraction of the cost. The development pressures closed-source providers to justify their pricing and raises the bar for the entire industry. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the strong start, the film's reported $200 million-plus budget means it still has a long road to profitability. The success is a significant milestone for Apple, which has previously struggled to translate its star-studded film projects into theatrical hits, and it was bolstered by strong audience scores and a heavy Imax promotion.</p>

According to the Golf Handicap Information Network, the 79-year-old president holds a handicap of 2.8, which is the lowest of any U.S. president in history and is considered extremely impressive for an amateur golfer of his age. Trump, who has been nicknamed the "golfer-in-chief," frequently plays at his courses and spent the weekend golfing with several key Republican senators. Legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus has previously commented that Trump loves the sport "more than he loves money."</p>
