        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont, owner of Cartier, reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan for its fiscal first quarter, a sharp reversal from last year's significant growth. The downturn is attributed to a strengthening yen, which has reduced spending by tourists, particularly from China. Despite the slump in Japan, the Swiss company's overall revenue increased by 6% to €5.41 billion, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division.

          <p>The England men's cricket team has been fined and docked two World Test Championship points for maintaining a slow over rate during their recent victory against India. The penalty, imposed by the match referee, caused England to drop from second to third in the championship standings. Captain Ben Stokes accepted the ruling, which fines players five percent of their match fee for every over their side fails to bowl in the allotted time. This is not the first time the team has faced such penalties this year.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart International, the creator of the popular Labubu toy line, fell by over 6% despite the company forecasting a profit surge of at least 350% for the first half of 2025. The negative market reaction suggests investors may be concerned that the company's explosive growth has peaked and could slow in the latter half of the year, prompting profit-taking. Analysts at Morningstar noted that the stock may be overvalued, with uncertainty about the long-term popularity of its intellectual properties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, prompted by safety concerns and patient deaths, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. The author noted a lack of a clear national plan for these roles when they were introduced, leading to them sometimes filling doctor vacancies without appropriate oversight.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run "swing-off" after the game ended in a 6-6 tie. The National League emerged victorious, 4-3, in the tiebreaker, with Philadelphia Phillies star Kyle Schwarber hitting three home runs to secure the win and earn MVP honors. The novel format, likened to a penalty shootout, required three batters from each league to take three swings each, with Dodgers third base coach Dino Ebel serving as the pitcher for the winning NL side.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that China's imports of naphtha, a key petrochemical feedstock, will surge to a record 16 to 17 million metric tons this year. This increased demand is driven by the startup of new ethylene plants and a strategic shift away from U.S. propane and ethane due to trade war-related supply disruptions. This pivot back to naphtha is expected to support Asian refiners' profit margins, as Chinese petrochemical producers seek to diversify their feedstock sources away from politically sensitive U.S. cargoes.
