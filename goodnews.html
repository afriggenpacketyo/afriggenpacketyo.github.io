          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revitalize Cadillac, aiming to restore its status as a leading American luxury car brand. GM President Mark Reuss has been deeply involved, emphasizing the importance of American luxury brands and pushing for Cadillac to showcase GM's capabilities. The strategy involves focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade, with the goal of creating a consistent brand approach and elevating vehicle residual values. Despite challenges in China and with EV production, Cadillac remains committed to its vision, highlighted by the bespoke Celestiq model, which is currently being relaunched after software issues were addressed.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala will celebrate Black style and the history of dandyism, aligning with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's spring exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style." The theme, "Tailored for You," will showcase Black designers and their influence on fashion, with stars like Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, A$AP Rocky, and Pharrell Williams serving as co-chairs. The exhibition aims to combat the erasure of Black history and acknowledge the significant contributions of Black designers, with a focus on tailored suits and menswear.

          <p>The Trump administration announced a program offering migrants in the U.S. illegally free airline tickets and a $1,000 stipend to voluntarily return to their home countries. Participants are instructed to use the CBP Home app to notify officials of their departure plans and will be deprioritized for arrest by ICE. The administration frames this as a "dignified way" to leave the U.S., conserving government resources and potentially allowing for legal reentry in the future. However, those who have been in the U.S. illegally for over a year may face a 10-year ban on reentry.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a decline following Warren Buffett's announcement that he will step down and Greg Abel will succeed him as CEO. Buffett, 94, revealed his decision at Berkshire's annual meeting, with the board unanimously voting for Abel to take over on Jan. 1, 2026, while Buffett remains as chairman. Despite the dip, analysts believe Buffett's continued presence as chairman will provide mentorship and guidance during the transition, the news is still of epic proportions for the company.

          <p>Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company.

Skechers withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance "due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies" as companies brace for a drop in consumer spending that will disproportionately impact the footwear and apparel sectors.
