          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:49:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many borrowers burdened with high-interest credit card debt may find surprising features in debt relief programs. For instance, being behind on payments can sometimes help qualify for debt forgiveness, as it demonstrates an inability to pay. Smaller debt amounts, such as $5,000 or more, may also qualify for relief, and taking out a debt consolidation loan can be advantageous by streamlining debt payoff with lower interest rates. Exploring options like credit card debt forgiveness, debt management programs, and debt consolidation loans can significantly improve financial health by reducing outstanding debt and simplifying repayment strategies.

          <p>Google is introducing A.I. Mode to its search engine, marking a significant shift towards artificial intelligence-driven search capabilities. This new feature will function as a chatbot, providing comprehensive answers and allowing users to ask follow-up questions, fundamentally altering how people interact with search. While A.I. systems have shortcomings, such as providing incorrect answers, Google aims to disrupt its traditional search business before competitors gain ground. The company is also introducing other A.I. features, including personalized email replies and automated shopping tools, amidst antitrust pressures and concerns from web publishers about potential traffic disruption.</p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating some cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, which are pegged to the value of other assets. This industry-backed measure establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, mandating that firms hold reserves of assets underlying the cryptocurrency to protect consumers. Supporters believe the act will formalize a key segment of the cryptocurrency industry, offering safeguards for consumers and growing the digital currency market. Critics, however, argue that the bill's regulations are weak and fail to adequately address conflict-of-interest concerns, exemplified by President Trump's dealings in stablecoins.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has outlined new regulatory guidance for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, setting stricter approval standards for healthy Americans. The agency now requires new clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness before approving boosters for healthy adults and children, moving away from relying solely on immunogenicity data. Different evidence standards will be applied based on patients' risk of severe illness, with randomized, placebo-controlled trials required for healthy individuals. This change comes as the Health and Human Services Secretary overhauls health agencies and immunization policy, potentially impacting the frequency of annual COVID vaccinations.</p>

          <p>Following former President Biden's announcement of an aggressive form of prostate cancer, experts have weighed in on the diagnosis, potential causes, and treatment options. While Biden's cancer is considered advanced, doctors note that modern treatments can effectively manage the condition for years. The typical course of care will likely involve androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to block testosterone production, which feeds the tumors. Doctors suggest that Biden's prognosis remains relatively positive due to advancements in treatment, although the diagnosis has raised questions about the timing and extent of his medical screenings.</p>

          <p>Seniors should evaluate how their retirement savings and plans have changed, especially given the recent market volatility, and consider if they should delay securing a long-term care insurance plan. They should also consider the possibility of needing to move into an assisted living facility. Long-term care insurance can help cover the costs of assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and in-home caretakers. By closely examining the costs of a plan versus future out-of-pocket expenses, seniors can determine if securing a plan now makes financial sense.</p>
