          <p>President Trump defended his decision to accept a $400 million jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, citing delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump stated that the U.S. should have the most impressive plane, especially since other countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE have more luxurious aircraft. He clarified that the jet is a gift to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar and will be retired to the presidential library once the new AF1 fleet is delivered. Trump emphasized that accepting the gift would save taxpayers money. The president was scheduled to visit Qatar as part of his Middle East trip.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated 11-1 by the Oakland Athletics, despite extra-base hits from Michael Conforto and Chris Taylor. Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman struggled at the plate, going 0-for-9 combined. Starting pitcher Landon Knack failed to finish the fifth inning, allowing two home runs to Jacob Wilson. The Dodgers' rotation is currently plagued by injuries, with Roki Sasaki joining Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow on the injured list, making Clayton Kershaw's return on Saturday against the Angels highly anticipated. Kershaw's debut marks his 18th season with the Dodgers, tying a franchise record.</p>

          <p>Dr. Rosemary Coogan, a British astronaut with the European Space Agency (ESA), is undergoing rigorous training at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, to prepare for potential missions, including a possible lunar excursion. Her training involves simulated spacewalks in a giant pool containing a replica of the International Space Station (ISS), mimicking weightlessness. Coogan's journey to becoming an astronaut involved studying astrophysics after realizing that meeting astronauts at school career days was rare. ESA aims to send Coogan to the ISS by 2030, and with NASA's Artemis program planning a return to the Moon, she may have the opportunity to become the first Briton to walk on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reduced most of their recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports, suspending a portion of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade discussions in Switzerland. The U.S. lowered tariffs imposed under President Trump's second presidency to 30% from 145%, while China reduced retaliatory tariffs to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain some tariffs and continue negotiations during the 90-day pause. China has agreed to suspend non-tariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat wounds and injuries, both on themselves and others. Researchers from the University of Oxford, working in the Budongo Forest, documented instances of chimps dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the material to injuries. This research builds on previous discoveries of chimps self-medicating with specific plants. The scientists also compiled decades of observations to create a catalog of how chimpanzees use forest plants for first aid. This study adds to growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to maintain health in the wild and demonstrates empathy among chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>Family offices are struggling to find qualified money managers despite rapid growth in the sector as ultra-rich individuals seek personalized wealth management services. By 2030, the number of family offices is expected to grow significantly, but a shortage of qualified advisors is anticipated. Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritizing long-term relationships over expertise. Family offices also face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. To attract and retain talent, some family offices are offering higher compensation packages, including bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

Carney said the invitation undermined messages the Canadian government was sending to the White House regarding Canada's sovereignty. This comes as Canada invited King Charles to open its parliament, a symbolic gesture of sovereignty. Tensions between the two countries have since abated, with further trade and security negotiations expected.

          <p>President Trump announced he will lift sanctions on Syria, ahead of a planned meeting with Syrian interim leader Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia. The decision was met with celebrations in Damascus, as the sanctions had previously blocked foreign financing, including aid. Trump said the policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness," while Syria's Foreign Minister hailed it as a "pivotal turning point." Al-Sharaa has called for the lifting of sanctions and the de-listing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) as a terrorist organization. The Syrian leader has promised to protect ethnic minorities since his Sunni Islamist group led the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime.</p>

The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade for civilian use and then shipping it to other Arab countries, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. This plan, which would be permanent, aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program and provide a more lasting solution than the 2015 nuclear deal.

A poll indicated that a significant number of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students in the U.S. are considering leaving due to the Trump administration's policies.

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole, after a judge granted a request to resentence them for the 1989 murders of their parents. The brothers expressed remorse and took responsibility for their actions during the hearing. The parole process will be long and could take years, and a clemency hearing is scheduled for June 13. The resentencing decision follows a recommendation made by the previous Los Angeles County District Attorney.</p>
