          <p>Actresses Dakota and Elle Fanning reflect on their successful careers after starting as child stars, attributing their stability to a strong family bond and mutual support. In a recent interview, they emphasized a complete lack of professional competition, explaining that they view each other's successes as shared family achievements. The sisters noted that their desire to protect one another and carve out individual paths when younger has evolved into a deeply collaborative and supportive adult relationship, helping them navigate the pressures of Hollywood. This dynamic has allowed them to defy the common narrative of troubled young actors.</p>

          <p>David Kaczynski, who made the difficult decision to turn his brother Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) over to the FBI, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of his brother's bombs. After the arrest, David felt immense guilt and began reaching out to victims' families to apologize for his brother's actions. Wright was one of the few who responded, leading to a decades-long bond built on mutual healing and understanding.

          <p>Financial markets are closely watching a series of upcoming labor market reports, as the data will be crucial in shaping the Federal Reserve's decisions on potential interest rate cuts for the remainder of the year. Key indicators, including the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) and the September nonfarm payrolls report, will provide insight into the health of the U.S. jobs market. Signs of additional weakness could strengthen the case for multiple rate cuts, while evidence of resilience might make the central bank more hesitant to ease its monetary policy further.

          <p>Members of the 1960s British band The Zombies are looking back on their unconventional path to lasting fame, which saw them break up before their most iconic album achieved legendary status. After initial success with hits like "She's Not There," the band produced the album "Odessey and Oracle," which was initially a commercial failure, prompting their split. A year later, the single "Time of the Season" became a surprise hit, and the album is now regarded as a rock classic, eventually leading to their induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame over 50 years later.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new industrial manufacturing model, described as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency of car manufacturing. This approach inverts the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts. Instead, the final assembly stage will "pull" parts from suppliers only when they are needed, aiming to reduce delays, minimize inventory, and lower costs. This strategic shift is designed to help China dominate the rapidly growing global space industry by mastering scalable and consistent production.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to executive coach and former world champion debater Kate Mason, professionals often undermine their own credibility by using self-deprecating or "minimizing" language. She advises against using phrases such as "It'll just take a second," "No worries if not," and "I'm not an expert, but…" at work. These expressions can set unrealistic expectations, de-prioritize your requests, and reduce your authority in a conversation. Instead, she recommends being direct, providing clear context for requests, and confidently embracing one's own expertise to communicate more effectively.</p>

          <p>The increasing number of store closures by national chains is creating a new opportunity for small and local businesses to secure commercial real estate in previously inaccessible or unaffordable shopping centers.

          <p>For neurodivergent people, such as those with ADHD or autism, managing personal finances can present unique challenges like executive dysfunction and time blindness. Financial coach Andrea Ewalefo advises that the most effective money move is to automate as much as possible, including bill payments, savings, and investments. By scheduling these transactions to coincide with paydays, it reduces decision fatigue and the number of mental "spoons" required for financial tasks. This strategy helps ensure financial obligations are met while freeing up mental energy and providing clarity on discretionary spending.</p>
