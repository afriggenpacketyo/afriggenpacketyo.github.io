          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations of violating state residents' data privacy rights, according to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. Google, however, did not admit any wrongdoing, stating that the settlement resolves old claims related to Chrome's incognito setting, location history disclosures, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. The company asserts that all policy changes related to these allegations were previously announced or implemented.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled her continued detention violated her First Amendment and due process rights. Judge William Sessions cited the lack of evidence against her beyond an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Ozturk's attorneys argued that her detainment was retaliatory and that she faced health risks in detention due to her asthma. Tufts University expressed pleasure at her release and welcomed her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled that her continued detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Judge William K. Sessions III stated that "Her continued detention cannot stand," and ordered her immediate release. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been held for six weeks, with her lawyers arguing that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel. The judge's decision marks another defeat for the government's efforts to deport international students associated with pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere this weekend after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in Earth orbit. The spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, is likely to survive its plunge through the atmosphere, although the exact landing location remains unknown. Experts believe the risk of injuries on the ground is low, and if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department.
