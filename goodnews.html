          <p>China successfully conducted the first test flight of its Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, designed for future lunar missions. The test involved a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre. The Mengzhou spacecraft has two versions: one for near-Earth operations and another for deep-space lunar missions. During the test, the escape engines ignited, and the return capsule separated cleanly from the escape tower, landing safely with an airbag system. This test verifies the safety of astronauts during potential rocket failures at launch.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, Japan, marking its first successful rocket landing after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters. The company aims to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029, utilizing technologies developed for its various products and automated driving systems. Honda has not yet decided on commercializing the technology but sees potential in launching satellites to enhance daily life services. The company believes that growing expectations for a data system in outer space will increase the demand for satellite launch rockets in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The Co-op is offering its members a ¬£10 discount on a minimum ¬£40 purchase following a recent cyber attack that resulted in the theft of customer data. The retailer stated it is nearing full recovery from the attack, which disrupted deliveries and caused empty shelves. While the offer is intended as a gesture of appreciation, some analysts believe it may indicate an effort to win back customers who have started shopping elsewhere. The cyber attack is estimated to have cost the Co-op millions in lost sales, but the retailer is not planning to offer any fraud prevention or identity monitoring services.</p>

This push follows delays in the release of Meta's latest AI model and Zuckerberg's frustration with the company's AI progress.

The changes, approved by the country's health products regulator, will begin next month and are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. Most people in a sexual relationship of six months or more with a single partner will be eligible to donate blood, regardless of their gender or sexuality.

This involves building a European pillar within NATO, maximizing the alliance's command structure and defense planning expertise. The goal is to ensure Europe can secure its interests and provide security guarantees, even without full U.S. support.</p>
