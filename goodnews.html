          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla's robotaxi service is "tentatively" scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with plans for a small initial rollout of about 10 to 20 robotaxis. These vehicles will use a new, "unsupervised" version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology and will be geofenced, with remote monitoring by employees. Musk emphasized the company's commitment to safety, noting that the date could be shifted if necessary, and shared a video of a Model Y navigating Austin roads without a human safety supervisor. The first ride from the factory to a customer's house is planned for June 28.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department plans to adopt a more targeted strategy in prosecuting corporate bribery cases occurring overseas. According to officials, this adjustment aims to align the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act with the broader objective of enhancing the United States' capacity to compete on a global scale. This refined approach suggests a shift towards prioritizing cases that have a significant impact on international trade and competition, while potentially reducing the focus on less consequential instances of corporate misconduct. The change reflects an effort to balance the need for ethical business practices with the desire to support American businesses in the international arena.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly investing $14 billion into Scale AI and attempting to recruit its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to Meta, reflecting Zuckerberg's frustration with Meta's current standing in the AI sector. Meta will acquire a 49% stake in Scale AI, a data-labeling and annotation startup that assists companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft in preparing data for AI model training. Wang is expected to lead a new AI research lab at Meta, aiming to improve Meta's AI capabilities and execution, especially after the lukewarm reception of the Llama 4 AI models. This strategic move mirrors similar approaches by Google and Microsoft, which have brought in AI leaders from other startups to bolster their AI divisions.</p>

The framework is contingent on approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping, after which implementation will proceed.

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a national ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime in schools to combat the growing amount of time children spend on digital devices. The Raising the Nation Play Commission reports that outdoor play in England has declined by 50% in a generation, attributing this to traffic-dominated streets, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The commission calls for a national Play Strategy for England, which includes updating planning policies to involve children in new developments and protecting play during school breaks. The government says it is working with experts to improve access to activities outside of school.</p>
