          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new government initiative guaranteeing paid work placements for young people who have been unemployed and out of education for 18 months. The policy, aimed at abolishing long-term youth unemployment, would require participation, with potential benefit sanctions for those who refuse without a reasonable excuse. This plan builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will be funded from existing budgets, with full details to be revealed in the upcoming November Budget. Business groups have welcomed the proposal as a way to help young people gain vital skills and enter the workforce.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce new proposals requiring migrants to prove their contribution to society to gain permanent settlement status, known as indefinite leave to remain. Under the new plan, legal migrants would need to demonstrate a high standard of English, maintain a clean criminal record, and participate in community volunteering. This policy aims to reform the immigration system by emphasizing integration and societal contribution. The government intends for these measures to create a clear distinction from the policies of rival parties and ensure that permanent residency is earned over time.</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as its new manager, replacing Graham Potter as the team sits 19th in the Premier League. The decision marks a return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style of football, similar to that of former manager David Moyes, after attempts at a possession-based approach failed. Nuno is known for organizing teams to be defensively solid and effective in transition, a style that analysts believe suits the current squad's strengths, particularly players like Jarrod Bowen. His appointment is seen as a well-reasoned move to stabilize the club and reverse its poor form.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European ruling party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a majority in parliamentary elections crucial for the country's path toward EU membership. The election was overshadowed by warnings of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and alleged plots to incite unrest. With most votes counted, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured around 50%, well ahead of the pro-Russian opposition bloc. The result solidifies the government's mandate to pursue European integration despite ongoing political tensions and the influence of the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to a base in South Korea for the first time. The mobile, ground-based system is designed to counter threats such as cruise missiles, drones, rockets, and mortars, functioning similarly to Israel's Iron Dome. The deployment was revealed in a photo showing a prototype launcher at a Patriot missile site. This move is seen as a strategic response to the military capabilities of both North Korea and China, enhancing the defensive posture of U.S. forces stationed in the strategically vital region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American shopping malls is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime retail space at more affordable rates. With rising vacancy rates in shopping centers, landlords are becoming more flexible, offering better rent deals and shorter lease terms to tenants like wellness practitioners, independent retailers, and service-based businesses. While the trend varies by region, the overall softening of demand for commercial real estate allows smaller enterprises to move into locations once dominated by national chains. This shift is helping to reimagine struggling retail corridors with unique, community-focused establishments.</p>

          <p>Music legend Dolly Parton has announced the postponement of her upcoming Las Vegas concert dates due to unspecified "health challenges." The 79-year-old singer stated on social media that her doctor has advised her to undergo "a few procedures," preventing her from rehearsing for the shows. In her characteristically upbeat manner, Parton joked that it was time for her "100,000-mile check-up." The concerts, originally scheduled for December, have been moved to September 2026, though she plans to continue working on other projects from her home in Nashville during her recovery.</p>

DeWanna Bonner was instrumental in the comeback, scoring 11 of her 13 points in the fourth quarter. The Lynx were playing without their injured star center, Napheesa Collier, which hampered their efforts to hold off the late surge from Phoenix, who now advance to the championship series for the first time since 2021.</p>

The contest, which attracted over 75,000 voters from around the world, aims to raise awareness for the nation's native bird species, 80% of which are threatened. The kārearea is a formidable predator capable of flying at 200 kilometers per hour, but its population is at risk due to habitat loss and introduced predators like cats and stoats. Conservationists use the competition to highlight the urgent need for increased investment in protecting New Zealand's unique wildlife.</p>
