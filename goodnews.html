          <p>President Trump's four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE was filled with fanfare and significant economic agreements, including a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange" with Qatar and a $600 billion investment promise from Saudi Arabia. These deals, while potentially overblown, signaled the Gulf states' eagerness to partner with the U.S. in business, military, and technology sectors. Trump also met with Syria‚Äôs new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy and lifting sanctions, while suggesting progress in nuclear talks with Iran, but largely sidestepped the conflict in Gaza. This trip underscored Trump's 'business-first' approach and a move away from American interventionist foreign policy. </p>

          <p>A cross-party group of lawmakers in Japan has urged the Defense Ministry to establish an office dedicated to investigating unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), commonly known as UFOs. The proposal emphasizes the need to address UAP as realistic and serious national security concerns, calling for a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office. The lawmakers propose regular reporting to parliament, public disclosure of information, and scientific analysis of collected data to identify potential threats.

          <p>HiSilicon, Huawei Technologies' chip design unit, experienced a 100% revenue increase in 2024, driven by the company's resurgence in the high-end smartphone market, according to Counterpoint Research. The unit captured 12% of the global premium Android smartphone system-on-a-chip market, up from 8% in 2023. This growth is attributed to a strong and loyal customer base in China and the popularity of its Pura 70 and Mate 70 series smartphones.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have uncovered the complex fluid dynamics behind flamingos' unique feeding behavior, revealing that the birds create vortices in the water to trap prey. By bobbing their heads, chattering their bills, and stomping their feet, flamingos generate tiny tornadoes that stir up and concentrate shrimp and algae. The shape of their bill creates a tiny tornado as it pulls out of the water. This research may have implications for improving water filtration technologies, as chemists are exploring flamingo-inspired techniques to keep filters clear of debris. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend indicates that Gen Z men are becoming more religiously affiliated, particularly with Christianity, while young women are increasingly leaving religious congregations. This divergence is contributing to a growing political gender gap, as young men find faith and their politics shift to the right, while young women's beliefs clash with religious customs. The study shows that religious customs are not jibing with their political and social beliefs, pushing them out of churches, and reinforcing that drift away from some organized religions. This shift complicates electoral choices, family life, and social belonging. </p>
