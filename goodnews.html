          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 05:29:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eurostar has announced plans to introduce double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time, ordering up to 50 "Celestia" trains from Alstom in a €2bn deal. This expansion aims to increase the fleet size by nearly a third, with the first six trains expected by 2031, potentially seating 1,080 passengers per 400m service. CEO Gwendoline Cazenave seeks to grow passenger numbers from 19.5 million to 30 million, also hinting at new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt. While this marks a significant upgrade for cross-channel travel, the new trains will require a multi-year certification process, and experts note that Britain's older rail infrastructure largely precludes widespread double-decker adoption beyond St Pancras.</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Holds Steady at 3.8% as Food Price Increases Slow</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in September for the third consecutive month, defying expectations of a rise to 4%. This stability is partly due to food and non-alcoholic drink prices increasing at their slowest rate in over a year, with a slight fall for the first time since May last year. However, prices for items like red meat and chocolate continue to climb, indicating persistent pressures in certain sectors. Despite this moderation, overall inflation remains significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, continuing to impact the cost of living for households and potentially influencing future benefit and state pension increases.

          <p>State lawmaker Zohran Mamdani's strong performance in the New York City mayoral race against former Governor Andrew Cuomo highlights a generational and ideological battle within the Democratic Party. Mamdani, 34, trounced Cuomo in the primary and leads consistently in the general election, appealing to younger voters with progressive ideas like rent freezes and free bus service. He leverages social media effectively, contrasting with Cuomo's traditional approach and political baggage, including a sexual misconduct scandal that led to his resignation. If Mamdani maintains his lead through election day, he would become the city's first Muslim mayor, signaling a significant political shift and a new era for urban leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 04:53:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golf legend Jack Nicklaus has won a $50 million verdict in a Florida defamation lawsuit against his former business partners, Nicklaus Companies, its owner Howard Milstein, and executive Andrew O'Brien. A jury found that the company had damaged Nicklaus's reputation by spreading false stories, including claims he considered joining the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League and suffered from dementia, implying he was mentally unfit. Nicklaus's attorney emphasized his client's lifetime of earning a respected reputation, which he deserved better than to have tarnished. This verdict follows a separate New York ruling that allows Nicklaus to design golf courses under his own name, while the company retains rights to sell branded merchandise.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu announced its robotaxi unit, Apollo Go, will begin test drives in Switzerland in December, partnering with public transit operator PostBus. The companies aim to launch a public-facing, fully driverless taxi service named "AmiGo" by early 2027, utilizing Apollo Go's RT6 electric vehicles, with plans to eventually remove steering wheels. This move signifies Baidu's concrete steps into the European market, following earlier partnerships with Lyft and Uber for deployments in the UK, Germany, and other regions. Other robotaxi firms like Pony.ai and Waymo are also rapidly expanding into Europe, intensifying the global race for autonomous vehicle services and transforming urban transportation landscapes.</p>

          <h2>Global Health Officials Affirm Polio Eradication Still Possible Despite Funding Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 04:39:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global health officials maintain that eradicating polio remains feasible, despite a significant 30% funding cut for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) in 2026 and a $1.7 billion gap through 2029. This shortfall stems largely from a global pullback in foreign aid, particularly from the US and other wealthy donor governments. In response, GPEI plans to intensify surveillance and vaccination in high-risk areas, collaborate more with other health programs like measles campaigns, and use strategies like fractional vaccine dosing to stretch supplies and cut costs. While challenges like conflict and vaccine hesitancy persist, officials emphasize the importance of continued commitment to achieve eradication, noting a decline in both wild and vaccine-derived polio cases since 2024.</p>

          <p>Manchester City defender Kerstin Casparij, an openly gay woman and Netherlands international, is advocating for LGBTQ+ inclusivity in women's football and wider society. Growing up in a small Dutch town, she initially felt being gay was not an option, discovering the LGBTQ+ community only after joining a first-team football club at 15. Now settled with her partner, Casparij uses her platform to inspire others, wearing rainbow laces and armbands, and dedicating goals to the transgender community. She is also a patron for the LGBTQ Foundation, working to provide safe spaces and support against domestic abuse and transphobia, emphasizing the need for more togetherness and community support for queer women.</p>

          <p>British lender Barclays has increased its full-year guidance and announced a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback, bringing forward a portion of its distribution plans and intending to move to quarterly announcements. The bank now expects a Return on Tangible Equity (RoTE) greater than 11% and net interest income exceeding £12.6 billion, reflecting consistent capital generation. Despite pre-tax profit for the third quarter slightly missing analyst expectations at £2.1 billion, the investment banking division saw an 8% year-on-year income increase, bolstering European financial stocks. However, the bank incurred a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loans scandal and another £110 million impairment charge from a "single name" claimant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The grandchildren of Ruth Ellis, the last woman hanged in Britain in 1955, are seeking a posthumous conditional pardon, arguing she was a victim of severe domestic abuse before killing her lover, David Blakely. Ellis, a nightclub hostess, shot Blakely after a tumultuous relationship involving infidelity and physical violence, including a punch that caused a miscarriage. Her family contends that under modern understanding of domestic abuse, she would have had a defense of diminished responsibility or loss of control, and that the punishment did not fit the crime. The case, which fueled public debate on capital punishment, highlights the devastating intergenerational trauma caused by her execution and the need to correct historical injustices.</p>

          <p>Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh has defended the club's process for appointing head coach Danny Rohl, insisting they did not "screw up" despite it appearing "clunky" externally due to asymmetric information. The club reportedly considered Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat before Rohl, who initially withdrew, ultimately took the role. Cavenagh clarified that he was involved in all discussions and that the previous candidates' decisions were largely due to timing and personal complications, not issues with the club's management. He emphasized that Rangers pursued multiple strong candidates simultaneously and is now fully focused on Rohl's leadership, dismissing reports of a ranked choice system and highlighting satisfaction with the current coach.</p>

Saunders expressed her delight at joining the cast, promising laughs from the on-screen family reunion. "Amandaland," a spin-off of "Motherland" following a middle-class family adapting to life in "SoHa," received rave reviews for its first series, and this reunion is anticipated to bring a fresh dynamic to the show before its second series airs in 2026.</p>

          <p>Apple's development of a foldable iPad with an 18-inch screen, projected to cost around $3,000, is reportedly facing significant engineering challenges, pushing its potential debut from 2028 to 2029 or later. The issues are tied to the device's weight, desired features, and the complex display technology required for an 18-inch foldable organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen, which is proving costly. Internally code-named J312, prototypes resemble a Mac laptop when closed and open to the size of a 13-inch laptop, but without an external display. This ambitious project is part of Apple's broader push for innovative new devices, alongside its ultrathin iPhone Air and a tabletop robot.</p>

          <p>New research has, for the first time, ranked the physical side effects of different antidepressants, revealing significant variations in impacts like weight gain and heart rate changes within the first eight weeks of treatment. A study by King's College London and Oxford University, analyzing 151 studies of 30 drugs, found some caused weight changes of up to 2kg and heart rate variations of 21 beats per minute. Researchers emphasize these differences can have clinical relevance, affecting patient health and adherence, and potentially increasing risks like heart attack or stroke. They advocate for closely matching antidepressants to individual needs and health conditions, moving beyond a "generic, cheap medications" approach in healthcare to empower patients and practitioners.</p>
