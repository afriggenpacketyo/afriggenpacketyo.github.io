          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is navigating a complex economic landscape, with President Trump criticizing him for not cutting rates and labeling him 'Too Late'. Economists are divided on whether Powell is acting appropriately, given the volatile policy mix and threats to both growth and inflation. While Trump pushes for rate cuts, recent economic data show no significant price spikes or slowdown, but surveys indicate heightened worries in manufacturing, services, and consumer sentiment. Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and labor market, dismissing the idea of pre-emptive rate cuts, despite concerns that the Fed may be behind the curve.</p>

          <p>A preliminary 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck near Greenback, Tennessee, early Saturday morning, shaking homes and waking residents across parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina. The U.S. Geological Survey reported receiving over 23,000 reports from the public within the first hour, though no immediate injuries or significant damage were reported.

          <p>Google has reached a settlement in principle with the state of Texas, agreeing to pay $1.375 billion over allegations of violating users' data privacy. The agreement resolves two lawsuits related to three products, with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton stating that Google secretly tracked users' movements, searches, and biometric data. Google maintains it did not admit any wrongdoing, and the settlement covers old claims related to product policies that have long since been changed. The agreement does not require product changes, but the settlement underscores the importance of data privacy and the consequences of violating consumer protection laws.</p>
