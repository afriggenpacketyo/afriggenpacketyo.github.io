        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article features a conversation with sociologist Alice Evans about the global decline in fertility rates and the challenges people face in forming relationships. Evans argues that technology, particularly smartphones and online entertainment, contributes to a "coupling crisis" by outcompeting personal interactions. She suggests that the constant dopamine hits from apps distract people from building social skills and forming meaningful connections. The discussion also covers economic factors, gender dynamics, and potential solutions like regulating technology and promoting community engagement, ultimately emphasizing the need to address the underlying causes of declining birthrates and the rise of solitude.</p>

          <p>Stock futures jumped after a federal court froze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump had overstepped his legal authority in assessing a 10% levy and other duties. The article notes the positive reaction in overseas markets and discusses the potential economic impacts if the Trump administration loses its appeal. However, it also acknowledges the possibility of the administration finding other ways to impose tariffs.</p>
