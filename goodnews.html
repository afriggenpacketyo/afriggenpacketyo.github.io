          <h2>UK Avoids Increased US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 18:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been excluded from President Trump's executive order that doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50%. The UK will maintain a 25% levy, conditional on compliance with the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8th, though this could increase if the UK does not comply with the EPD terms by July 9th. A UK government spokesperson affirmed commitment to safeguarding British businesses and jobs in key sectors, including steel, as part of their plan for change. This move highlights ongoing trade negotiations and economic relationships between the US and UK, emphasizing the importance of adhering to agreed-upon terms to maintain favorable trade conditions. Optimism is present in this situation for the UK, as they avoid the doubling of tariffs. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 18:09:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization, regaining the title of the world's most valuable publicly traded company for the first time since January. Shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker rose about 3% to $141.40, marking a nearly 24% surge over the past month, driven by sustained growth despite export control and tariff concerns. The company's market cap reached $3.45 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft's $3.44 trillion. This achievement underscores Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market and its ongoing competition with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft for market leadership. </p>

          <p>Mondelƒìz International, the company behind Oreo, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi in the US, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its snack packaging. Mondelƒìz claims that Aldi's similar packaging is likely to deceive consumers and capitalize on the company's brand recognition. The lawsuit includes side-by-side comparisons of Mondelƒìz products with Aldi's versions, including Wheat Thins, Nutter Butter, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. Mondelƒìz asserts that if Aldi continues with its product lines, it will irreparably harm the Mondelƒìz brand. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 17:29:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a key catalyst for the bank's stock. The removal reflects the bank's progress in addressing past deficiencies, including the cross-selling scandal. Wells Fargo can now grow its deposit base, expand loan activity, and develop its dealmaking division. While some stock gains already reflect the anticipated removal, further upside potential remains, as the firm works to shed its troubled past. (not investment advice)</p>

Participants, often with gun charges, are paid $20 an hour to learn hard and soft skills needed to launch careers in the entertainment industry. The program aims to combat gun violence by providing transformative artistic outlets and addressing trauma. Since its inception in 2021, over 60 people have graduated from the program, with 70% still employed. </p>
