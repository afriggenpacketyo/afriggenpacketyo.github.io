          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the 13th named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Haiti, Jamaica, and the Dominican Republic. The National Hurricane Center reported that the slow-moving storm could strengthen into a hurricane by Friday, but its long-term track is uncertain. While significant flash flooding and landslides are possible on the islands, current forecast models suggest that Melissa is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States.</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with prediction markets Kalshi and Polymarket, a first for a major U.S. sports league. The deal provides the platforms with access to official NHL data and logos, while the league gains customer protections and brand exposure. The move signals a growing acceptance of prediction markets, which allow trading on event outcomes, but has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association over concerns about unregulated gambling. The NHL defended the partnership as an opportunity to reach new audiences.</p>

          <p>According to Parisian master jeweler Stephen Portier, the thieves who stole treasures valued at over $100 million from the Louvre will struggle to profit from their heist. The global network for fine jewelry is small and interconnected, and dealers worldwide are now aware of the stolen pieces, making them nearly impossible to sell intact. If the thieves dismantle the jewelry to sell the stones and metal separately, their value would plummet by as much as 90%. The unique, old-fashioned cut of the diamonds and identifiable nature of the pearls make them difficult to disguise.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentarian Ken Burns explored the dual legacies of the American Revolution, balancing its triumphs of liberty with its tragic aspects of exclusion and hypocrisy. Discussing his new documentary series, Burns emphasized the importance of embracing the story's complexity, including the moral flaws of figures like George Washington and the devastating impact on Indigenous and enslaved peoples. He argued that understanding these unresolved contradictions is crucial for comprehending America's contemporary identity and that a complete, nuanced history ultimately enlarges the power of the Revolution's core ideas.</p>

          <p>Shares of GE Vernova saw a lift following a report that its CEO, Scott Strazik, has been in multiple meetings with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. This development suggests a potential partnership where GE Vernova could supply power equipment and electrification products for OpenAI's massive AI compute needs, a possibility that aligns with some investors' strategic outlook. The discussions indicate that as AI companies secure chip supply from firms like Nvidia, their next major focus is securing the vast amounts of electricity required to power their operations.

          <h2>Homebuyers Consider Pros and Cons of Locking Mortgage Rates Before October Fed Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again in October, potential homebuyers are debating whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for them to fall further. Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protection against unexpected market spikes, but risks missing out on lower rates if the Fed acts as anticipated. However, delaying is also risky, as lenders may have already priced in the cuts, and unlocking a rate can incur a "float down" fee. The decision involves balancing the desire for a lower rate against the security of a known cost. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from individual applications. Both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home for life. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in access to less equity compared to an older single borrower. Couples must carefully weigh the benefits of eliminating mortgage payments against long-term implications, such as what happens if one spouse passes away. (not investment advice)</p>
