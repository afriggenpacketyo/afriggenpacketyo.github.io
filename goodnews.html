          <p>Many job seekers are facing a frustrating experience characterized by a perceived 'Glass Wall,' where numerous job postings are visible, but applications seem to yield no results. Blake Isaacs, a marketing professional who coined the term after sending over 1,000 applications, describes the feeling of being unable to access recruiters or hiring managers. Experts recommend strategies for overcoming this obstacle, emphasizing the importance of networking and leveraging personal connections to break through the perceived barrier. The experience highlights the disconnect between available positions and the challenges faced by individuals seeking employment in the current job market.</p>

Andreeva, who is playing in her third French Open, had previously lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals the previous year.

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults suggests that parenting can be simplified by following five basic rules. These include trusting parental instincts, embracing cultural traditions, paying attention to each child's unique interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist emphasizes the importance of love, attention, and emotional modulation in raising children, noting that every generation faces unique challenges and parents should avoid overcomplicating the process. By prioritizing these simple rules, parents can navigate the complexities of child-rearing with greater confidence and less anxiety.</p>

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on Karla Flores' spine through her eye. Flores, who had been experiencing double vision, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI, doctors discovered a second chordoma at the top of her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohamed Labib developed a complex surgical plan, using a 'third nostril' approach to reach the spinal tumor, which was successfully removed. The procedure involved cutting through the membrane protecting the eye and removing part of the eye socket, leaving Flores with no external scars.</p>

          <p>Harvard-trained educator Angela Duckworth argues that children who learn to use AI effectively will become smarter adults, emphasizing that AI should be used as a coach rather than a crutch. Duckworth suggests that students should avoid simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers, instead using AI to explore concepts and ask follow-up questions. She highlights AI's ability to teach by example and aid in understanding complex topics, but stresses the importance of verifying AI's output and integrating AI usage into school curricula. Kathy Kristof, a side hustle expert, recommends using AI for tasks that don't involve the final product, such as creating outlines, to leverage its benefits while mitigating potential errors.</p>

          <p>A carjacking reported in central California turned out to be an insurance scam, according to Madera County sheriff officials. Martha Gutierrez DeRomero initially told authorities that two masked men stole her Chevy van containing $60,000 worth of fitness merchandise. However, after multiple interviews, investigators determined that DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma, staged the entire incident. Both have been charged with insurance fraud and filing a false police report, diverting resources from those who truly need help.</p>
