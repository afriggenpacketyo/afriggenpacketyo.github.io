          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn to campaign against the growing influence of oligarchy and advocate for progressive policies. The town hall, part of Sanders' "Fighting Oligarchy" tour, drew a large crowd supportive of Mamdani's pledges to freeze rent prices, increase housing, and raise taxes for the wealthiest 1%. Both leaders condemned capitalistic greed and emphasized the need for a government that represents working people, challenging mainstream Democrats who have been slow to embrace Mamdani's agenda.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the US and China has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air. The technique harnesses the energy released from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles, a phenomenon known as cavitation. By using lasers to heat light-absorbing materials, water droplets boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, create a strong propulsive force. This technology also allows for controlling the robots' movement in water, demonstrating an efficient new launching mechanism.</p>
