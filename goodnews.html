          <h2>Report Finds Cause of Heathrow Airport Shutdown Still Undetermined</h2>

          <p>An interim report indicates that the cause of a fire that led to a shutdown of Heathrow Airport, disrupting hundreds of thousands of journeys, remains unknown. The fire occurred at a nearby electrical substation, causing a power outage at the airport on March 21. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) stated that a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation, but the Metropolitan Police found no evidence of suspicious activity. Heathrow Airport has welcomed the interim findings, hoping the final report will clarify the cause of the fire and prevent future incidents, as the airport's management has faced criticism for its decision to close the airport during the power outage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, footage has captured a Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand, laying an egg from its neck. The video was taken at a facility where conservation rangers have been caring for the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades, mimicking their natural alpine habitat. These snails are hermaphrodites and can reproduce when encased in a hard shell, simultaneously exchanging sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg. Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity and lays about five eggs a year, with each egg taking over a year to hatch, highlighting the species' slow survival and reproductive habits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maersk, a major shipping company, has revised its global container market volume growth forecast for 2025 due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, particularly related to U.S.-China trade tariffs. The company reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit, but cited concerns that current tariff policies could restrict global trade volumes. The Trump administration's policy includes significant import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on U.S. goods. Maersk CEO Vincent Clerc noted that the first quarter reflected strong demand, but the company remains cautious due to the complex tariff landscape.</p>

She relies on her knowledge of color theory and labels her palettes to overcome these challenges, proving her determination and skillset. Despite being eliminated from the competition, Ailish remains proud of her work and looks forward to pursuing her goals in film and theatre.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year ending March 2026, while also reporting results for its fiscal fourth quarter and full year. Revenue fell 24.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier, while profit plunged nearly 50%, which was largely expected as Nintendo fans await the Switch 2 and hold off on buying the current console. The company's forecasts are based on current U.S. tariff rates, and President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that additional tariffs could decrease demand in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a trade agreement with Britain, signaling a potential win for both countries seeking closer economic cooperation. The agreement would be the first since Trump imposed tariffs on trading partners, later paused to allow for negotiations. The agreement could lower British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as remove British taxes on U.S. technology companies, with British officials eyeing the deal as a way to offset weaker relations with Europe. The agreement would offer vindication for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump, but the details remain unclear.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that washing work uniforms at home may not eliminate harmful bacteria, potentially spreading superbugs. Testing home washing machines revealed that many failed to remove potentially harmful material, even at high water temperatures. This means home washing machines are a hub for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Experts recommend that healthcare professionals and their institutions re-evaluate policies that allow workers to wash their work clothing at home. The team also recommended using a disinfectant for those washing machines at least once a month.</p>

The letters revealed her interest in dancing and ping pong skills, and a more serious letter from a commander that expressed his unrequited love for her.</p>

          <p>California beaches have been visited by hundreds of thousands of glittering Velella velella, also known as by-the-wind sailors, due to a shift in wind patterns. These small, blue, gelatinous creatures are typically found on the open sea, but strong winds have blown them onto the shore. The phenomenon is part of the spring transition when wind direction changes, stranding the Velella along the coastline. Though related to jellyfish, their stinging cells are harmless to humans, and the creatures begin to decompose quickly once out of the water.</p>
