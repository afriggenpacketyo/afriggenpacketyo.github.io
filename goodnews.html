The royal couple met with teachers and pupils at the schools the victims attended and visited a memorial playground built in their honor. Prince William delivered a speech paying tribute to the resilience of the community and the grace of the bereaved parents. He praised the pastoral work of the school staff and encouraged the children to be brave, joyful, and kind, assuring them that those affected by the tragedy would not be forgotten.</p>

          <p>Napoleon Jinnies, who made history as one of the NFL's first male cheerleaders with the Los Angeles Rams in 2018, is defending the Minnesota Vikings' male performers against recent social media backlash. Jinnies stated that the negative comments are unoriginal and do not critique the cheerleaders' actual artistic and athletic abilities. He recalled facing similar heckling during his own career but emphasized that the support he received far outweighed the hate. Jinnies praised the Vikings' cheerleaders, Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn, for their exceptional skill and for performing perfectly in sync with their female teammates.</p>

          <p>Amid speculation that she is considering a 2028 run for the Senate or presidency, this opinion article analyzes the political trajectory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It notes a recent poll showing Democratic voter preference for progressive figures like AOC over establishment Democrats. The author discusses her perceived shift from an unapologetically left-wing firebrand to a more centrist figure, particularly regarding her stance on the conflict in Gaza. Despite this, the piece concludes that AOC's charisma and fighting spirit make her a formidable candidate to lead a post-Trumpism Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A woman has shared her story of two strangers who came to her rescue when her 120-pound Rottweiler, The Dude, went into a panic during an unexpected fireworks display. Fearing the powerful dog would pull her onto the slippery sidewalk, the owner was frozen until a man named Blake offered to help walk them home. When that failed, Blake drove his car over and, with the help of his friend Bubba, safely transported the woman and her terrified dog home. The owner expressed immense gratitude for their kindness, calling them "two angels" who rescued her from a dangerous situation.</p>

          <p>This article explores how S&P Global turned its S&P 500 stock market index into an incredibly lucrative business, generating hundreds of millions in annual revenue. The index's success was propelled by the creation of financial products like S&P 500 futures, index funds, and ETFs, which pay licensing fees to use the S&P name and data. The brand's trusted reputation, economies of scale, and its role as a common language for investors have created a nearly impenetrable competitive moat. Despite recent concerns about the index's heavy concentration in a few tech giants, it continues to dominate the market as a reflection of the U.S. economy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128, which is about $210 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year. This significant drop in borrowing costs provides substantial annual savings for new homebuyers and has also created attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to lower their monthly payments.

In an interview, he stated that while he believes rates can come down gradually, the central bank must be careful not to be "up-front aggressive." Goolsbee cited the fact that inflation has remained above the Fed's 2% target for over four years as a key reason for prudence. His comments highlight the ongoing debate within the FOMC about balancing the risks of slower economic growth with the need to control persistent inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

In another significant move, Harry Brook has been promoted to vice-captain, replacing Ollie Pope, which could increase pressure on Pope's position at number three in the batting order. The squad includes a powerful pace-bowling contingent, with Mark Wood named despite a long injury layoff, as England aims for its first Ashes win in Australia since 2010-11.</p>
