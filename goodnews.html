        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Met Office, in collaboration with Met Éireann and KNMI, has unveiled the list of storm names for the 2025-26 season, commencing in September. This annual tradition designates storms anticipated to cause medium or high impacts, primarily due to strong winds, but also heavy rainfall or snow, which can lead to flooding or travel disruption. Over 50,000 public suggestions from across the UK, Netherlands, and Ireland contributed to the final selection, which includes names like Amy, Bram, and Chandra, some with personal stories. The system, established in 2015, aims to disseminate clear and consistent information about severe weather, enhancing public safety and preparedness. For example, Storm Floris recently saw 93% awareness in amber warning areas.</p>

          <h2>High School Students Develop New Trigonometric Proof for Pythagorean Theorem</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two high school seniors from St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson, have achieved a remarkable mathematical feat by independently developing new trigonometric proofs for the Pythagorean Theorem. This problem was previously thought impossible to solve using trigonometry for over two millennia, with only one other documented proof existing before their breakthrough. Their groundbreaking work, which they presented at an American Mathematical Society conference, garnered international attention and commendation, challenging perceptions about who can achieve high-level mathematical innovation. Despite their significant accomplishment, both students plan to pursue different fields in college, though they continue to explore further mathematical proofs, having already identified five more and a general format for additional ones.</p>

          <p>Cajun and Zydeco music, the distinct and intoxicating sounds of southwest Louisiana, are experiencing a remarkable renaissance, captivating new and young audiences. Rooted in a unique blend of French, African American, Creole, and Spanish cultures, these genres feature the accordion, fiddle, and often French lyrics, characterized by a haunting and syncopated rhythm. Musicians like the Grammy-winning Savoy family and Zydeco artist Chubby Carrier are central to this revival, preserving a vital cultural heritage. Despite the diminishing use of Louisiana French, the music serves as a crucial transmitter of the culture, with artists like Jourdan Thibodeaux emphasizing the importance of actively living one's culture to prevent its vanishing.</p>

          <p>St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans, the institution where math prodigies Calcea Johnson and Ne'Kiya Jackson achieved their groundbreaking proofs, boasts a remarkable legacy of empowerment and academic success for young Black women. Founded in 1867 by the Sisters of the Holy Family, inspired by Creole nun Henriette Delille, the academy was dedicated to educating African American women, defying anti-literacy laws of the time. The school maintains an impressive 100% graduation and college admission rate, instilling a belief in boundless possibilities for its students. Despite facing immense challenges, including the devastation of Hurricane Katrina which necessitated a complete rebuild, St. Mary's Academy has prevailed and continues to uphold its founding vision of service, spiritual, and intellectual growth.</p>

          <p>Will Smith's pinch-hit, walk-off home run dramatically secured a 5-4 victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Arizona Diamondbacks, preventing a three-game sweep. This crucial win, described as a "gut-check" moment by manager Dave Roberts, moved the Dodgers two games up in the National League West standings. Despite a stellar seven-inning, one-run performance from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto and an early lead, the Dodgers nearly squandered their advantage in the ninth inning, highlighting ongoing team inconsistencies. This victory, while a much-needed morale boost, tempers concerns about the team's maddening second-half performance, with Roberts emphasizing the urgent need for sharpened focus and consistent play from the entire roster.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have secured an unprecedented three-peat in The Hundred men's cricket tournament, dominating the league for three consecutive years with their expertly built and well-led team. Under coach Tom Moody and captain Sam Billings, their consistent success is attributed to maintaining a stable core of players and making shrewd selections, allowing each member to excel in their specific roles, particularly with varied bowling attacks and late-innings batting power. However, this era of dominance might be drawing to a close, as new investment and operational changes are expected to bring new owners and potentially transform the tournament into a T20 event. Such looming changes could lead to a new auction system and limitations on player retention, potentially dismantling the Invincibles' highly successful squad.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an emergency order halting the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children, with some already seated on planes. U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan intervened after immigrant advocacy groups argued the plan was illegal, preventing children from being removed without due process or the chance to pursue asylum claims. Government lawyers claimed the children were being repatriated at their parents' request, but this was disputed by the children's attorneys, citing cases where parents did not request repatriation. The ruling mandates that children already on planes be deplaned and returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities, underscoring a significant legal battle over migrant children's rights and federal authority.</p>

Arsenal's manager Mikel Arteta adopted an ultra-conservative approach, which was criticized as a significant missed opportunity to make a statement against the reigning champions. Despite substantial transfer spending, Arsenal's attack rarely troubled Liverpool's defense, only showing urgency after conceding the late goal. This early-season clash highlighted Liverpool's ominous form and Arsenal's continued struggle to overcome their Anfield "misery," raising questions about Arteta's strategic boldness in crucial matches, despite his claims of improved performance.</p>
