          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation involving staff and ex-staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) is raising concerns about oversight in the defense sector. The investigation, which involves detentions in Belgium and the Netherlands, focuses on possible irregularities in contracts for ammunition and drones. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte stated the agency initiated the investigations and aims to uncover the full extent of the issue. The probe serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency as defense spending increases amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

The discussions, led by Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds, cover defense, trade, fishing rights, and a potential youth mobility scheme. While government sources claim significant progress, Conservative and Reform UK leaders criticize the deal as a "surrender." Key announcements are expected regarding British access to an EU defense fund and a post-Brexit fishing rights agreement, with mixed reactions from opposition parties on the proposed youth mobility scheme.</p>

          <p>The global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity is expected to expand in Asia, with Chinese biotech firms like Innovent Biologics vying for a share dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Analysts predict several new drugs will be approved for commercial sales in the next five years, increasing competition and lowering prices. Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for obesity-control drugs worldwide to US$150 billion by 2035, anticipating growth in China and Japan due to low market penetration and ongoing innovation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill, which extends tax cuts and increases military and border security spending, advanced in the House after negotiations with conservative holdouts. The bill faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition from blue-state Republicans over the state and local tax deduction. The agreement involves minor modifications, but conservatives are still pushing for stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies. The legislation's fate remains uncertain as it moves toward a floor vote.</p>

This measure aims to support Japan's goal of attracting 60 million foreign visitors by 2030.</p>
