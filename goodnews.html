        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and per-capita consumption, largely attributed to growing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, as organizations like the WHO state no level is safe. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, which corresponds with a reduction in alcohol-related deaths and other negative outcomes for young people. While this shift is largely positive for public health, the article notes it could be linked to a broader trend of reduced social interaction.</p>

          <p>During a recent television appearance, actress Margaret Qualley shared a humorous anecdote about her attempt to play matchmaker for her mother, Andie MacDowell, and actor Bill Murray. After discovering Murray now lives in the same city as her mother, Charleston, she approached him with the idea. Murray candidly responded that he and MacDowell did not get along well during the filming of their 1993 movie "Groundhog Day," citing disagreements over punctuality and line memorization. Despite this, Qualley expressed her belief that their shared history and single status could still make for a compelling, if unconventional, romantic pairing.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor, urging its board to implement significant strategic changes to address chronic underperformance. In a public letter, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio through divestitures, and refreshing the board of directors. The firm criticized Avantor's past leadership for costly acquisitions at peak market valuations and for rejecting a potentially lucrative takeover offer in 2023. Engine suggests that if these changes are implemented, Avantor's stock could be worth between $22 and $26 per share by 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has awarded former FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation $250,000 in a default judgment against blogger Jim Stewartson. The defamation lawsuit stemmed from a series of posts in which Stewartson accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and of planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge granted the default judgment after Stewartson failed to formally respond to the lawsuit, stating that the blogger acted with malice and that punitive damages were warranted to deter similar behavior. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and intends to contest the ruling, calling the legal action an attempt to intimidate him.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market data indicates that Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip series, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple still holds the top position with 49% market share, its lead has narrowed, reflecting a renewed competition centered on screen technology and device innovation. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer or foldable iPhone models in the near future to counter Samsung's momentum.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the summit between Presidents Trump and Putin, a coalition of European nations including Britain, France, and Germany issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine. The leaders emphasized that Russia cannot have veto power over Ukraine's potential membership in NATO or the EU and that no limitations can be placed on its armed forces. The statement signals Europe's intent to maintain pressure on Russia through sanctions until a just peace is achieved. This coordinated response highlights Europe's effort to manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral U.S.-Russia meeting, to which they were not invited.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, a decorative gold finial measuring about 1.5 inches, was found near the historic route of Dere Street, a major Roman road. This discovery is particularly significant as it was found near the site where a similar object was unearthed in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair may have been deliberately buried for a religious or ceremonial purpose. The find suggests that high-status individuals continued to use the ancient thoroughfare long after the Roman Empire's decline.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with homicide rates falling to levels not seen in nearly 50 years. This success is attributed to a multi-faceted strategy implemented by Mayor Brandon Scott's administration, which combines data-driven, focused deterrence with robust community support and stricter prosecution. The approach targets individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence, offering them social services like housing and job training while also ensuring legal consequences for continued criminal activity. This comprehensive, collaborative effort involving city agencies, community partners, and law enforcement marks a significant turnaround for a city long plagued by high rates of violence.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Starting Retirement Savings Earlier Than Public Perception Suggests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal age to start saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. Experts emphasize that beginning to save in one's early 20s, even with small monthly contributions, can lead to a significantly larger nest egg over time. While achieving retirement in one's late 50s is possible when starting at 27, it requires aggressive and consistent savings. The advice comes as many Americans express regret for not starting their retirement planning sooner, often citing debt or insufficient income as major obstacles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps primarily learn their complex communication styles, which combine vocalizations and gestures, from their mothers. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar patterns and frequencies of these communication combinations, a resemblance not found with paternal relatives. Because young chimps spend their formative years almost exclusively with their mothers, the findings indicate that these behaviors are socially learned rather than genetically inherited. This discovery provides a potential clue into the evolution of human language, suggesting that the capacity for socially acquired communication may date back millions of years to a common ancestor.</p>

          <p>California has approved a landmark conservation plan aimed at protecting the western Joshua tree from the long-term threats of climate change and development. The plan identifies crucial habitat areas where the species is most likely to survive in a warmer climate and recommends measures like limiting development and reducing wildfire risks. The underlying law, passed in 2023, is controversial as it requires permits and mitigation fees for removing or damaging the currently abundant trees, sparking opposition from local officials and residents in high desert communities. Proponents hail the forward-looking strategy as a groundbreaking effort to conserve a species based on future climate projections.</p>
