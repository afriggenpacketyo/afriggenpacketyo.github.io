        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg prices for consumers experienced a decrease in May, reaching a five-month low of $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This 11% drop from April's $5.12 is attributed to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in demand. While prices remain higher than they were a year ago, experts note that the containment of avian flu has been a significant factor in the recent decline. However, the bird flu outbreak is not entirely contained and continues to impact the industry.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, President Trump's former advisor, expressed regret for some of his recent criticisms of the president on social media. This follows a public falling-out between the two, sparked by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill. White House officials have reportedly urged Musk to repair his relationship with Trump, while the president stated he has no desire to rebuild their relationship. The White House press secretary said Mr. Trump was "appreciative" of the public apology from Musk.</p>

The deal would ease concerns among major military suppliers, such as Lockheed Martin, about potential disruptions to the supply of these materials. China's export restrictions on rare-earth elements had previously threatened the production of essential military equipment, including fighter jets and missiles, and the agreement ensures the supply of magnets and necessary rare earths from China.

          <p>Rare earth elements are essential components in a wide range of technologies, from cellphones and medical devices to wind turbines and weapons. These 17 chemically similar elements, found within the Lanthanide series, are often described as the "vitamins" of industry, enabling technologies to become smaller, faster, and stronger. China dominates the production and processing of rare earths, accounting for a significant portion of global output, while the extraction and refining processes can pose environmental challenges. They are not rare in the sense of abundance, but rather in the difficulty of extracting and separating them.</p>
