          <p>Researchers in Germany have discovered 31 shipwrecks in Lake Constance since beginning a project in 2022. Among the findings are two large metal hulls believed to be from paddle steamers, one of which may be the SD Friedrichshafen II, destroyed in a WWII air raid. The project has also uncovered a remarkably preserved cargo sailing ship and other historical artifacts, which are being studied as "time capsules" of past craftsmanship and events. The exploration is set to continue until 2027, offering more potential insights into the region's maritime history.</p>

The company's strategy is to sell a barebones, two-seat base model and allow owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate aims to address the high sticker price of EVs, a major drawback for consumers, though the vehicle's competitiveness may be challenged as federal EV tax credits expire.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson, who had accused Patel of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. A federal judge in Las Vegas awarded Patel $250,000 in damages after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit. The judge ruled that while criticism of public figures is protected, Stewartson's defamatory falsehoods were made with actual malice and were not protected speech.</p>

While expressing disagreement with subsidizing green energy, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the administration would respect Congress's will.

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has called the potential intervention "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move aligns with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S., though the structure of such a deal remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
