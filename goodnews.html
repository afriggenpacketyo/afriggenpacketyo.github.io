          <p>China is strategically investing heavily in Africa's copper sector, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Botswana, to secure vital supplies for the global green energy transition. Copper is emerging as a crucial element for EV batteries, solar systems, and defense, prompting Beijing's proactive approach amidst Western restrictions on Chinese acquisition of critical mineral assets. Chinese companies are aggressively expanding their footprint, exemplified by JCHX Mining's acquisition and significant investment in Zambia's Lubambe Copper Mine, calling it "strategically pivotal." This initiative aims to bolster China's supply chain resilience and leadership in new energy industries, despite geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, has announced that the institution of the Dalai Lama will definitively continue after his death, bringing an end to years of widespread speculation.

This significant decision addresses appeals from Buddhists globally, particularly those within Tibet, who seek continuity.

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has issued a ruling blocking the Trump administration's plan to terminate the temporary protected status (TPS) and work permits for hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants this fall. Judge Brian Cogan sided with a group of migrants who sued, asserting that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacks the statutory authority to partially vacate Haiti's TPS designation before its Biden-era expiration in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the Executive Branch from enforcing immigration laws or ending discretionary benefit programs. Advocates continue to warn that Haiti remains unsafe due to persistent gang violence and severe health problems.</p>
