          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general and his former defense lawyer, as the acting librarian of Congress, replacing Carla Hayden, who was accused of placing 'inappropriate books' in the library. Library staff resisted, denying access to two Justice Department officials chosen for senior positions. The staff recognizes Robert Newlen as acting librarian until Congress provides direction. Democrats criticized the move as a 'power-hungry assault' on the legislative branch, calling for an investigation into unauthorized access to congressional or library data. The Library of Congress houses the Congressional Research Service and the Copyright Office, holding over 25 million books.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's attempt to remove three Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) board members, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffers sought to review CPB's operations. CPB leaders denied this request, citing federal law establishing its independence from the federal government. This action is part of a broader assault by the president against public broadcasters. CPB is challenging Trump's efforts to remove board members in court, arguing that the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 protects it from federal interference. The executive order claims to direct CPB's board to end federal funding to PBS and NPR, which CPB argues is illegal.</p>

Argentinian customs officials initially suspected the boxes contained propaganda and other items from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad.

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber responded to Education Secretary Linda McMahon's letter criticizing Harvard's handling of antisemitism on campus, asserting that the university shares common ground in combating bigotry. Garber argued that the Trump administration's actions undermine Harvard's constitutional freedoms and disregard its compliance with the law. He refuted claims that Harvard is a partisan institution and listed actions taken to address campus issues. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status, prompting Garber to defend the university's commitment to intellectual diversity and inclusivity.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport faced significant flight delays due to a staffing shortage at an air traffic control facility. The FAA delayed incoming flights by nearly seven hours from various airports in the U.S. and Canada.

The Transportation Secretary plans to reduce the number of flights to mitigate delays and is investigating the move of air traffic controllers to Philadelphia.

          <p>Republicans are pushing for policies to encourage one parent to stay at home with children, even as the White House considers cutting federally funded day care. Ideas include increasing financial support for families with children and removing tax credits for day care. Senator Jim Banks introduced a bill to effectively pay stay-at-home parents, while Senator Josh Hawley suggested expanding the child tax credit to $5,000 per child. Conservatives argue they aim to provide parents with a choice to work less, but critics point out that many families require two incomes to survive, and such policies may disproportionately affect women.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese products for 90 days, following trade talks in Geneva. Chinese imports will face a minimum tax of 30 percent, down from 145 percent, while China will lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. This decision comes after the U.S. ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods, bringing much trade to a standstill and causing disruptions for American businesses. The move aims to provide short-term relief for retailers but raises questions about whether it will lead to any substantial concessions from China beyond a commitment to keep talking.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to reduce high prescription drug prices ‚Äì but its details and long-term effects are far from clear. Citing figures that patients in other countries pay much less than Americans for pharmaceuticals, Trump said he would order drug companies to reduce their prices inside the US. He touted the move as "one of the most consequential" executive orders in US history, claiming prices would fall "almost immediately, by 30% to 80%". (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level in April as revenue from President Donald Trump's trade war started kicking in. Customs duties totaled $16.3 billion for the month, some 86% above the $8.75 billion collected during March and more than double the $7.1 billion a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Monday. That brought the year-to-date total for the duties up to $63.3 billion and more than 18% ahead of the same period in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming "we risk becoming an island of strangers." It is a phrase some, particularly on the left, regard as repulsive. Others counter that it is a widely held perception which it is high time those in high office shared. The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK. Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people.</p>

          <p>Shares of major toy makers rallied on Monday after the U.S. agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on China. The agreement will pause most tariffs and other trade barriers for 90 days, including reducing the 145% levy President Donald Trump had in place on Chinese imports to 30%. The stocks had been hammered by Wall Street as investors anticipated manufacturing hiccups and price hikes resulting from the tariff scheme. The toy industry is heavily reliant on supply chains in China, leaving toy makers at the mercy of trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>
