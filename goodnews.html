          <p>Portugal defeated Germany 2-1 in the Nations League semifinal, despite Joshua Kimmich's milestone 100th appearance for Germany and an assist for their first goal. Kimmich expressed disappointment in his team's performance, citing a lack of energy and activity on the ball. Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winning goal for Portugal, marking his 137th international goal and 220th game for his nation. Despite the loss, Kimmich believes the German team is more consolidated than in the past, while Ronaldo continues to thrive under pressure, leading Portugal to another Nations League final.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their school. Students expressed mixed feelings about graduating at the Bowl instead of their traditional "Stadium by the Sea."

The Hollywood Bowl ceremony served as a symbol of the students' resilience, with speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal offering words of encouragement, and the Los Angeles Philharmonic gifted the venue to the school.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to excel in the sky. The study focused on the structural details of feathers dating back 99 million years, during the Cretaceous period. Researchers found that the development of thrust and lift-generating feathers was crucial for bird evolution. While some feathered dinosaurs could glide or had powered flight, modern birds are their direct descendants.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria colonizing a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections. Specifically, Bifidobacterium longum, found in babies shortly after birth, appears to halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns and tracked their health for two years, finding that babies with this bacteria were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. This discovery could lead to new therapies that promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara due to environmental concerns. The order halts work on the onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture in 2015, through at least July 18. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review. The ruling was celebrated by environmental groups who seek public input and scrutiny regarding the pipeline's restart.</p>
