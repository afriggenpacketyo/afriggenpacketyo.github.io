          <p>NHS England has announced plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in hospital A&E departments. These walk-in clinics, accessible via GP or police referral, will provide immediate treatment for individuals experiencing acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the initiative as a pioneering model for providing the right support in the right setting, while Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism due to the scheme's untested nature and called for better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people facing long waits in A&E, underscoring the urgency for improved mental health care access.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a planned partnership between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting the creation of at least 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. A White House official suggested that Trump's endorsement indicates approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition plan for U.S. Steel, despite national security concerns. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have both expressed their support for the partnership. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, noted that the U.S. is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance amid ongoing trade discussions.</p>

          <p>Many women are apprehensive about becoming pregnant due to pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a condition affecting up to 8% of women with an average diagnosis wait time of 12 years. Contraception, the primary treatment, poses a dilemma for those wanting children, as discontinuing it can trigger severe anxiety or suicidal thoughts. Women are calling for more research into PMDD to provide treatment options beyond contraception. The Welsh government has allocated ¬£3 million to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are opting to 'quiet quit,' prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations, these individuals are content with fulfilling the minimum job requirements, unmotivated by praise or performance-related bonuses. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to embrace this approach. This shift reflects a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation, who often prioritized work over personal lives.</p>

Former players note that fans may romanticize a player's love for the club, only to be disappointed when they move on. Local players sacrifice certain aspects of their career for the sake of representing their community, adding another layer to this dynamic.</p>

Koizumi is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. for potential collaboration.

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of foreign-grown rice to offer consumers more affordable options amid rising domestic rice prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at its stores, priced lower than Japanese-grown rice. Other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. This move reflects consumer interest in cheaper alternatives due to record-high rice prices in Japanese supermarkets.</p>
