          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed Asian military officials at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warning of China's "imminent" threat to Taiwan and its ambition to become a "hegemonic power." He urged Asian countries to increase their defense spending and collaborate with the U.S. to deter war, emphasizing that the U.S. does not seek conflict with China but will not allow China to dominate its allies. Hegseth also cautioned against economic ties with China, suggesting Beijing would exploit them to exert "malign influence" and complicate U.S. defense strategies; his remarks followed a similar appeal from French President Emmanuel Macron for Europe to be Asia's ally. The Chinese Embassy responded by calling the U.S. the biggest "troublemaker" for regional stability. </p>

The couple aided injured neighbors before firefighters arrived, and Landolfi returned to the site several times without success before finding her phone during a search with Bat Cave Disaster Relief.

The procedure involved facial plastic surgeon Dr. Kalpesh T.

          <p>A carjacking reported in Central California was discovered to be an insurance scam orchestrated by Martha Gutierrez DeRomero and her boyfriend, Alfredo Ledezma. DeRomero initially claimed two masked men stole her Chevy van containing $60,000 worth of merchandise, but investigators determined the story was fabricated. DeRomero and Ledezma were charged with insurance fraud and filing a false police report. Sheriff Tyson Pogue condemned the attempt to exploit emergency services for personal gain. </p>

          <p>Consumers are adopting a more frugal approach to summer vacations this year due to economic uncertainty and President Donald Trump's announcement of widescale tariffs. While more people plan to travel compared to last year, summer travel budgets have been scaled back. Travel costs have declined, with hotel room rates and airfares down, but people are cutting back on in-destination spending and opting for cheaper lodging and transportation options. Flexibility with travel dates, destinations, and activities can also help save money this summer. </p>
