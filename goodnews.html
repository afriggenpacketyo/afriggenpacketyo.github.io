          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, injuring at least 19 sailors. The incident occurred around 8:30 p.m. when the ship reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into one of the bridge's pillars. Cellphone videos captured the collision, showing crew members dangling from the masts. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue was the likely cause. </p>

          <p>The CBS show "48 Hours" will feature the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where investigators discovered a rare clue: bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene. Childs was stabbed more than 60 times in her apartment. The footprints, determined to belong to the killer, led to a decades-long search for answers. DNA evidence eventually linked Jerry Westrom to the scene, leading to his arrest and conviction, despite his denials and the presence of other DNA at the crime scene.

          <p>Former President Trump has publicly scolded Walmart after the retail giant warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, suggesting the company should absorb the costs instead. Trump stated that Walmart made billions of dollars and could afford to "EAT THE TARIFFS." Walmart responded that it would do its best to keep prices low, citing small retail margins. Economists warn that tariffs will inevitably drive up prices, forcing businesses to choose between raising prices and laying off workers. </p>

          <p>The UK government is considering plans to have convicted criminals fill potholes and clean bins as part of an expansion of unpaid work programs. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes current community sentences are too lenient. The proposal involves probation teams working with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. Instead of wages, the money earned would go into a fund for victim's groups. </p>
