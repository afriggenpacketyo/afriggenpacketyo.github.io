Officials are urging anyone with information to come forward, emphasizing the importance of public safety and warning that aiding the fugitives will result in prosecution.

Discussions are ongoing, and there is hope for a ceasefire that would allow the return of all hostages.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that the tariffs imposed by President Trump are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The US Court of International Trade's decision argues that Trump surpassed these limits and that the tariffs violate the separation of powers. The court's decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court, but if upheld, Trump would likely not be able to reimpose the tariffs. The court also concluded that the tariffs do not effectively address the threat of drug trafficking.</p>
