          <p>Google is partnering with Italian firm Energy Dome to integrate its innovative CO2 Battery technology into renewable energy projects worldwide. This long-duration energy storage system compresses carbon dioxide into a liquid to store surplus clean energy, then expands it to generate electricity when demand rises. Utilizing off-the-shelf components, this closed-loop process offers up to 24 hours of carbon-free backup power, addressing the intermittency of wind and solar. This initiative is crucial for stabilizing power grids and supports Google's ambition to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, marking a significant step in sustainable energy solutions.</p>

          <p>Human foot remains found inside a hiking shoe on Utah's Fish Lake have been identified via DNA as belonging to David White, a man missing since 1997. White disappeared after going fishing, with his boat later found empty on the lake. Investigators connected the 1996-made boot to his cold case, and subsequent DNA analysis confirmed a 99.9994% parental match with his daughter. This significant breakthrough brings long-awaited closure to White's family and the search and rescue teams who have been puzzled by his disappearance for nearly three decades.</p>
