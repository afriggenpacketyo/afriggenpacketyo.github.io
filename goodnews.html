          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, marking a promising turn in the nation's battle against the opioid crisis. Data from the CDC reveals a nearly 27 percent drop in drug fatalities across major drug categories and most states, signaling the impact of public health interventions and increased access to treatment. However, this progress is threatened by proposed funding cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing addiction. Experts caution that reducing resources could reverse the positive trend, particularly as addiction remains a complex issue intertwined with various socioeconomic factors. </p>

          <p>Smartmatic has accused Fox News and Fox Corp executives, including Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, of destroying text messages related to the 2020 election claims. The voting machine company claims this was an orchestrated effort to create an evidentiary void in their multibillion-dollar defamation lawsuit. Fox News denies the allegations, calling it a distraction from Smartmatic's weak case and evidence preservation failures. The filing comes after a judge ruled that Fox News can access documents related to a Department of Justice investigation into three Smartmatic executives. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has proposed a pause on expanding state-funded health care benefits to more low-income immigrants without legal status starting in 2026, citing a $12 billion budget deficit. This decision is driven by the program's higher-than-expected costs and economic uncertainty related to federal tariff policies. Existing enrollees will not be affected by the freeze, and children will continue to receive benefits. Additionally, adults with 'unsatisfactory immigration status' on Medi-Cal may have to pay a $100 monthly premium starting in 2027. </p>

Social media campaigns and documentaries have fueled new interest in their case, with some arguing that their claims of abuse were not taken seriously at the time.
