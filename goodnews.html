          <p>A mother discovered that mattress pads advertised as "crafted in the USA" were actually made in China, leading to a complaint and a $3 million fine against Williams Sonoma for false advertising. The FTC requires products labeled "Made in the USA" to be virtually all manufactured domestically, including ingredients and components. Consumers are advised to check labels carefully for exact wording and be wary of qualifying language like "Assembled in the USA". This case highlights the importance of verifying claims and the potential impact of civil penalties on companies making false claims. </p>

The program depends on the passage of a massive budget bill, which the CBO found would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt while cutting Medicaid and food assistance programs.
