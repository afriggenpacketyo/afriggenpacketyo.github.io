        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article presents a personal essay arguing that choosing a small Bible college over an Ivy League institution like Yale led to a more fulfilling life and stronger faith. The author critiques what they perceive as ideological conformity at elite universities, contrasting it with the focus on character, truth, and intellectual freedom found in their chosen educational path. The decision prioritized spiritual and personal formation over prestige and networking opportunities, a trade-off the author ultimately finds rewarding and valuable for their life.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," investigates the complexities of chronic pain, identifying the brain as a primary source rather than just the site of injury. The article highlights the story of a musician with a severe pain syndrome who found relief through an experimental deep brain stimulation treatment that interrupts pain signals before they reach conscious awareness. This innovative research suggests that pain is a measurable and treatable brain circuitry issue, offering new hope for millions suffering from conditions previously thought to be unmanageable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article offers parenting advice based on the work of a child psychologist who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, emphasizing that genuine connection fosters cooperation. It outlines six "magic phrases," such as "I believe you" and "Let's figure this out together," designed to create emotional safety and validate a child's feelings. The approach aims to de-escalate conflicts, build trust, and encourage listening by shifting the dynamic from a power struggle to a collaborative partnership, ultimately making cooperation a natural outcome of the relationship.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the advanced vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership significantly strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates, marking a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal hunter challenges the common progressive disdain for hunting, arguing it is a more ethical and sustainable way to consume meat than relying on factory-farmed products. The author describes the emotional and spiritual connection felt when hunting, framing it as an honest engagement with the realities of life and death that modern society often ignores. The piece also addresses the complexities of gun ownership and highlights the role hunters play in wildlife conservation, suggesting common ground on food ethics.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, commemorates the 140th anniversary of surfing's introduction to the U.S. mainland by three Hawaiian princes. In 1885, teenage royals David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were attending a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of the traditional Hawaiian "surfboard swimming" was documented in a local newspaper and planted the seeds for the sport's eventual popularity in America.</p>

The single-use plastic items, which are common in sushi takeaways, are used for mere seconds but can persist in the environment for centuries. While the containers are technically recyclable, their small size makes them difficult for processing machinery to handle correctly, meaning they often end up as waste, prompting the government to include them in its latest legislative ban.</p>
