        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations of 2.3%. This growth was largely driven by a significant decrease in imports, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, and a rebound in consumer spending. Despite concerns over trade disputes, the data showed economic strength, although some underlying indicators suggest a potential slowdown in domestic demand. The personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, eased slightly but remained just above the central bank's target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has articulated his strategic vision for artificial intelligence, focusing on the development of "personal superintelligence." In a letter released ahead of the company's earnings report, he contrasted his approach with industry trends, emphasizing AI as a tool for individual empowerment rather than large-scale automation. This follows Meta's multi-billion dollar investment in AI talent and infrastructure, including the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs. The move echoes his previous heavy investment in the metaverse, signaling a major long-term commitment to this new technological frontier.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has invited leaders of the resident doctors' union, the BMA, for new talks next week to resolve the ongoing dispute. While Streeting stated he would not renegotiate the recent 5.4% pay rise, he expressed willingness to discuss working conditions, such as career progression and exam fees. He warned, however, that the union's latest strike action had eroded the government's goodwill. The BMA, which argues that doctors' pay has effectively fallen by a fifth since 2008, has yet to formally respond to the invitation.</p>

          <p>In a move to capitalize on the growing demand for premium moviegoing experiences, Cinemark is adding 20 new ScreenX theaters across the U.S. and Latin America. This expansion deepens its partnership with South Korea's CJ 4DPlex, the company behind the 270-degree panoramic screen format. The investment reflects a broader industry trend where audiences are increasingly willing to pay higher prices for enhanced formats like PLFs (premium large formats). The new screens are being prepared for major upcoming releases, including "Wicked: For Good" and "Avatar: Fire and Ash."</p>

          <h2>Trump Urges Federal Reserve to Cut Rates Following Strong GDP Report</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the release of a stronger-than-expected 3% GDP growth figure, former President Donald Trump publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The economic expansion was largely influenced by a sharp drop in imports due to his administration's tariff policies. Despite the positive headline number, some economists point to underlying data, such as slowing consumer and investment metrics, suggesting the economy is losing momentum. The Fed, however, is widely expected to hold rates steady, viewing the economy as resilient enough to withstand current borrowing costs for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, Ethereum is experiencing a resurgence in institutional interest, positioning its future outlook as stronger than ever despite recent market struggles. This renewed optimism is fueled by new U.S. crypto legislation focusing on stablecoins, the majority of which are issued on the Ethereum network. While Ethereum has faced challenges from competitors like Solana and a complex value proposition compared to Bitcoin, analysts believe it is now entering an "institutional arc." The focus is shifting from NFTs and DeFi to the tokenization of traditional financial assets by major institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

This ritual of kindness persists in homes on the verge of collapse, offered by people who have endured torture, loss, and displacement.

For example, some one-year CDs offer APYs around 4.40%, while five-year terms can yield up to 4.20%.

With the labor market remaining solid, recent GDP growth surprising on the upside, and potential inflationary effects from new tariffs, policymakers are expected to maintain their cautious stance.
