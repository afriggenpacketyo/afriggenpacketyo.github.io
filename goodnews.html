Frontier Airlines had the highest rate of complaints per passenger, while Southwest, Alaska, and Hawaiian Airlines performed best in terms of overall complaints and flight cancellations. The report also notes a slight improvement in mishandled baggage and wheelchairs, but overall, passengers are increasingly frustrated with air travel. </p>

          <p>President Trump's recent Middle East trip resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. American chip giants Nvidia and AMD will be allowed to sell advanced chips to these countries as they seek to become AI powerhouses. The deals, negotiated by Trump's AI advisors David Sacks and Sriram Krishnan, have raised security concerns from both U.S. political parties, as the previous administration had limited tech exports to the region due to fears of the technology falling into the wrong hands.

          <p>Arab Gulf states, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, are competing to deepen their ties with the U.S. by offering President Trump lavish displays of wealth and significant economic commitments. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange"; Saudia Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S., and major projects were signed with the United Arab Emirates, after Abu Dhabi in March committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework in the U.S. These gestures aim to secure a seat at the table of the next world order and access to advanced technologies. Some analysts suggest the Gulf countries are competing with each other for Trump's affection. </p>

          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland, has been marked by political tensions, protests against Israel's participation, and controversial song themes. Despite efforts by organizers to maintain neutrality, the event has faced disruptions and calls for Israel's exclusion due to the conflict in Gaza. Scandals include complaints about song lyrics and staging, while bookmakers favor ballads and pop arias among the frontrunners. The competition also features a trend of transnational cooperation, with artists representing countries other than their own. </p>
