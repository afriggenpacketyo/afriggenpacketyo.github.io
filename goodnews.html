          <p>The Federalist Society, a traditionally right-wing legal organization, showed surprising ambivalence toward President Trump's executive actions at a recent gathering. While speakers generally supported Trump's policies, particularly deregulation, they expressed concern about the ‚Äúchaos‚Äù within the administration. Some speakers even advocated for stripping power from the executive branch, favoring judicial oversight, especially regarding Trump's tariffs. This suggests a potential conflict between the Federalist Society's vision of judicial power and Trump's approach to governance, potentially hindering lasting conservative policy changes.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce stricter immigration rules in response to voter discontent over high immigration levels. This shift comes as the right-wing Reform UK party gains traction by capitalizing on immigration issues. The new policies will restrict skilled visas to graduate-level jobs and limit lower-skilled visas to sectors crucial for industrial strategy, while also requiring businesses to increase training for British workers. These measures aim to regain control over immigration and address concerns about strained public services and ethnic tensions, signaling a departure from previous open-border policies.</p>

          <p>Two new studies on chimpanzees reveal key elements that may shed light on the origins of human language. Researchers found that chimps use rhythmic drumming patterns, with different populations using distinct structures akin to regional accents, and combine calls to create new meanings. These findings suggest that rhythmic structures and call combinations, both vital to human speech, were present in our evolutionary ancestors. The research also supports the idea that social interaction, such as gossip, may have driven the development of complex communication.</p>

          <p>To accelerate the rebuilding of fire-ravaged areas in Los Angeles, Congress should modify the tax code to address unique challenges faced by fire victims. Current tax laws incentivize residents to hold onto burned lots to avoid significant income taxes on insurance proceeds and property sales. Proposed reforms include exempting fire victims from income taxes on insurance payouts and lot sales, and allowing buyers to defer income taxes on home sales if proceeds are reinvested in the fire areas. These changes would encourage both sellers and buyers, revitalizing affected communities and restoring the tax base.</p>
