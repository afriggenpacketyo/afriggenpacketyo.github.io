          <p>According to data from International Data Corporation (IDC), Huawei has reclaimed the top spot in China's smartphone market for the second quarter, its first time leading since 2020. The company achieved an 18.1% market share despite an overall 4% contraction in the Chinese smartphone market. This resurgence highlights Huawei's strong brand appeal and effective management, even as competitors like Vivo and Oppo followed behind. Apple ranked fifth, maintaining its position partly through strategic price adjustments to align with government subsidies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng has advocated for a global supply chain system based on free trade and the comparative advantages of all nations. Speaking at an international expo, he criticized some countries for promoting "manufacturing reshoring" and imposing tariffs under the guise of "de-risking," which he argued reduces global economic efficiency. He emphasized that there are no winners in trade wars, highlighting ongoing tensions between China, the US, and the European Union over the future of global trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to work together to defend global fairness and justice. Speaking at a meeting in Tianjin, Wang criticized hegemonism, power politics, and protectionism, which he attributed to certain unnamed countries prioritizing selfish interests. He urged the Eurasian security bloc, which includes China and Russia, to advocate for an equal, multipolar world and a more reasonable global governance system. The SCO was originally formed to address terrorism, separatism, and extremism in the region.</p>

          <p>The ongoing England-India Test series has renewed criticism over slow over-rates, with significant portions of play being lost each day due to the slow pace. On day two of the third Test, 15 overs were lost, not to weather, but to delays including frequent ball changes, drinks breaks, and player tactics. While penalties like fines and World Test Championship point deductions exist, they have had limited impact. Commentators and former players are debating more severe in-game solutions, such as run penalties or requiring teams to bowl all 90 scheduled overs regardless of time.</p>

          <p>Australian AI startup Greenroom Robotics has been granted one of the first AUKUS exemption licenses, allowing it to share sensitive technology with defense partners in the U.S. and Britain. The exemption, part of the AUKUS security pact, will accelerate the company's collaboration on software for autonomous, crewless boats. Greenroom's technology acts as a vessel's "brain," enabling navigation and control without a human crew, a capability Australia sees as vital for protecting its extensive coastline. The software also has dual-use applications, such as monitoring for whales.</p>

          <p>A dispute is growing among German states over the country's summer holiday schedule, with several states demanding an end to what they see as an unfair advantage for Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. While most states rotate their holiday slots annually to manage travel and prices, the two southern states always have their break last, a tradition linked to Pentecost holidays. Critics argue this forces families elsewhere into peak-season prices, but leaders in the south, like Bavarian Premier Markus Söder, are refusing to change what they consider part of their regional identity.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods group Richemont reported a 15% drop in sales in Japan during its fiscal first quarter, as a strengthening yen has curbed the tourist spending boom seen last year. A weaker yen had previously fueled a surge in purchases from international shoppers, particularly from China, benefiting Richemont and other luxury brands. Despite the decline in Japan, the group's overall revenue grew 6% to €5.41 billion, narrowly beating analyst expectations. The company's high-end jewelry division, featuring brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, continued to perform strongly, rising 11%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's healthcare system has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, authored by Prof Gillian Leng, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the roles, highlighted by cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors.</p>

As part of the deal, Trump claimed Indonesia committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, plus 50 Boeing jets, pulling back from a previously threatened 32% tariff.

          <p>Twenty years before this week's Open Championship, a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy shot a course-record 61 at Royal Portrush, a round that those present describe as legendary. His playing partner, Aaron O'Callaghan, recalls how the crowd swelled as word spread of the teenager's incredible performance, which included five consecutive birdies to finish. The round, which McIlroy later said he remembered shot-for-shot, cemented his status as a superstar in the making. This historic achievement provides a stark contrast to his emotional missed cut when The Open returned to Portrush in 2019.</p>

Huang highlighted that over 1.5 million developers in China use Nvidia's platform and emphasized that China's open-source approach to AI is a catalyst for global progress.
