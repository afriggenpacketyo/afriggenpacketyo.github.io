          <p>Following their $8-billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison and his team have detailed their plan to revitalize the media company. The strategy includes nearly doubling the studio's annual film output, with a focus on major franchises like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Transformers," as well as filmmaker-driven original projects. Ellison emphasized a goal to depoliticize the company's content to appeal to a broader audience and restore Paramount's status as a top destination for talent. The new leadership, backed by Skydance Media and RedBird Capital, aims to build the company for long-term growth rather than focusing on quarterly earnings.</p>

The blaze burned through dense, dry brush for about 40 minutes, with helicopters making water drops to assist ground crews. While no homes were immediately threatened and no evacuations were ordered, one firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion during the response. The cause of the fire remains under investigation as crews work to clear any remaining hotspots in the area.</p>

          <p>The flood threat in Juneau, Alaska, has ended after an "outburst flood" from the Mendenhall Glacier caused the Mendenhall River to reach a record-breaking level of 16.65 feet. The flood was caused by the release of water from Suicide Basin, a side basin dammed by the glacier, which has become an annual event due to climate change. Temporary "Hesco" barriers installed by the city successfully protected most of the nearly 1,000 structures in the flood zone, preventing a catastrophic event. While some areas remain underwater, officials report minimal damage compared to previous years.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure, is becoming mainstream, with 55% of business travelers reporting they have had loved ones join them on work trips. For C-suite executives, this figure rises to 73%. The trend is driven by a desire to reclaim personal time, reduce loneliness on the road, and save money on vacations by leveraging company-paid flights and accommodations. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a "policy grey zone," carefully separating expenses to ensure the company incurs no additional costs for their companions.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move could lead to the swift end of the Infowars brand, with the receiver empowered to take control of all property, bank accounts, and websites. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction, viewing this as a final step toward accountability for Jones's cruel harassment. This state-level action follows a lengthy and complex federal bankruptcy process for Jones and his parent company.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD can provide significant wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, published in the British Medical Journal, found that individuals who started medication had notable reductions in first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings are based on data from nearly 150,000 people and provide strong evidence that medication can help mitigate impulsive and distractible behaviors linked to these negative outcomes. Researchers believe this information can help patients make more informed decisions about treatment.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. actions against China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to maintain a competitive edge. HD Hyundai, a major Korean conglomerate, plans to invest $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts suggest this move helps South Korean companies overcome domestic constraints like high labor costs and union tensions. Shifting operations to countries with lower labor costs is seen as a strategic way to strengthen their market position against Chinese competitors.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur lost the UEFA Super Cup to Paris St-Germain on penalties after conceding two late goals to squander a 2-0 lead. Despite the heartbreaking collapse, the performance showed promising signs of new manager Thomas Frank's tactical approach. For 85 minutes, Spurs displayed a pragmatic and efficient 3-5-2 formation, excelling at set-pieces, which produced both of their goals. While the late defensive lapse highlights areas for improvement, the disciplined performance against a top European team suggests Frank is building a solid foundation, moving away from the high-risk style of his predecessor.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing shift in public trust from traditional media institutions to individual online creators who provide news and analysis on social platforms. While social media is rife with misinformation, a growing number of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and specialists—are using these platforms to deliver factual, nuanced content to audiences seeking credible information. The author argues that this new ecosystem, while challenging, represents the birth of a new media model. To thrive, it needs new infrastructure, such as certification systems to verify creator standards and collaborative frameworks to provide support, similar to how the music industry adapted to streaming.</p>

          <p>Brinker International, the parent company of Chili's, reported strong quarterly results, with same-store sales at the restaurant chain increasing by 23.7%. CEO Kevin Hochman credited the success to a significantly increased marketing budget, which grew from $32 million to $137 million over three years, and the effective use of social media influencers. He also highlighted the popularity of the standardized $10.99 value meal, which provides customers with a clear deal without needing coupons. This growth-focused strategy is helping the company combat industry-wide inflation and improve profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>
