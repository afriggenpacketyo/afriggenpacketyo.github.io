          <p>Fifty years after its release, key figures involved in the 1975 blockbuster "Jaws" are sharing their memories of its notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls initially turning down his role, believing the film would be a failure, while screenwriter Carl Gottlieb discusses adapting the script to create one of cinema's most terrifying experiences. The article explores the on-set tensions, the challenges of filming on the open ocean with a malfunctioning mechanical shark, and how director Steven Spielberg's ingenuity turned a troubled shoot into a cultural phenomenon that launched the summer blockbuster era.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva have agreed to a cooperative effort to integrate artificial intelligence into their respective agricultural sectors. The plan includes establishing a joint AI laboratory focused on enhancing family farming in semi-arid regions like Brazil's Sertão. This partnership aims to connect AI technology with common farm machinery to improve environmental monitoring and soil quality. The agreement, discussed during the BRICS summit, signifies a strengthening of bilateral relations and a shared commitment to technological advancement in farming.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's economic policies, particularly the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." He contested projections that the bill will increase the national deficit, arguing that his models, which predict 3% economic growth, show it will ultimately reduce the deficit. Hassett also discussed the upcoming trade deadline, suggesting that new deals will be finalized and that countries are responding to tariff threats by moving production to the U.S. He dismissed concerns about potential Medicaid coverage losses, stating the bill's work requirements are reasonable and that job creation will lead to more people getting insurance.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first British Grand Prix at a chaotic, rain-swept Silverstone, benefiting from a controversial penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri. Piastri, who had been leading, received a 10-second penalty for driving erratically during a safety-car restart, allowing Norris to overtake him after the final pit stop. The race also saw veteran Nico Hulkenberg achieve his first-ever podium finish in his 239th attempt. The event was marked by dramatic incidents, including a spin by Max Verstappen, who ultimately finished fifth before a record crowd.</p>

          <p>Experts writing in the official newspaper of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) have advocated for structural changes within the Chinese military to effectively counter the growing threat of drones. Citing the critical role of unmanned aircraft in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, they propose the creation of specialized counter-drone combat units. As a long-term goal, this would address inefficiencies in the current system. In the interim, they suggest enhancing existing units, such as upgrading electronic warfare divisions into intelligent counter-unmanned teams capable of AI-driven analysis and mobile jamming.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in northern Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a strategic trading hub, connecting ancient communities from the Pacific coast with those in the Andes and the Amazon. The site, which contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, is seen as crucial for understanding the fate of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas. This discovery adds to Peru's rich history of major archaeological finds, including Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines.</p>

          <p>Originally a gift from France to celebrate the end of slavery, the Statue of Liberty was not initially associated with immigration. This article traces its transformation into a symbol for newcomers, largely influenced by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus" and the opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility. It explores the political shifts in U.S. immigration policy, from the restrictive ethnic quotas of 1924 to the landmark 1965 act that ended them. The piece reflects on how the statue's meaning was ultimately defined by the millions of immigrants who saw it as a beacon of promise.</p>

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions and political rhetoric at the national level, many local U.S. government officials continue to welcome investment from China. According to a leader from the China General Chamber of Commerce, American city and state leaders are actively seeking Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. While potential Chinese investors are concerned about the geopolitical climate, the economic benefits and the desire to produce goods within the U.S. to avoid tariffs remain strong motivators. Officials in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive to such investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach highlights five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person seem judgmental and erode trust. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, while preambles such as "To be honest…" can make others defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions as one perspective among many. The goal is to be mindful of both intent and impact to foster more positive relationships.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its influence in the Western Balkans through a strategy that combines religious soft power with major infrastructure projects. The construction of large, Turkish-funded mosques, such as the Namazgah mosque in Albania, is just one element of a broader geopolitical push. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's government is also investing heavily in railroads, ports, and hotels across the region, a policy described by one expert as "infrastructure imperialism." This strategy aims to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, projecting an image of modernity and shared destiny with Balkan nations.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in the stock market may be fueled by investors prematurely pricing in significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve expected in 2026. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, the market is already showing signs of anticipating a cycle of seven rate cuts, which historically boosts equity performance. This optimistic outlook persists despite recent statements from the Federal Reserve suggesting that near-term cuts in 2025 are not guaranteed, creating a potential disconnect between current market behavior and immediate economic indicators.
