          <p>Jony Ive, the former Apple designer known for his work on the iPhone and iPad, is joining OpenAI to help develop new devices with generative AI capability. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised a prototype Ive shared as "the coolest piece of technology that the world will have ever seen." The collaboration signals OpenAI's ambition to expand beyond software and create innovative hardware products powered by artificial intelligence. The specific nature of these devices remains undisclosed, but they are expected to push the boundaries of AI integration in everyday life.</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any decrease in consumer demand due to President Trump's tariffs. Jassy's comments were made during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting. While Amazon acknowledged tariffs as a potential factor influencing future guidance, they haven't seen significant average selling price increases yet. This contrasts with rival retailer Walmart, which has warned of potential price hikes due to tariffs, prompting a response from Trump urging them to absorb the costs.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, argued that the stock market offers significantly more opportunities than real estate. Responding to a question about his preference for stocks over property, Buffett acknowledged Charlie Munger's fondness for real estate but emphasized stocks' superior potential for long-term returns. He cited the S&P 500's substantial growth compared to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index since 1988 as evidence. Buffett's perspective reinforces his long-standing investment strategy focused on the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, a Democrat known for his dedication to federal workers and opposition to President Trump's policies, died at 75 after battling esophageal cancer. Connolly, who served nine terms, was a key figure on the House Oversight Committee and fought to protect civil service job protections. He actively criticized Trump's efforts to purge the civil service and defended the interests of his constituents in Northern Virginia. His career included local politics in Fairfax County before his election to Congress in 2008.</p>

          <p>The FDA has cleared the first blood test to detect amyloid plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, in individuals aged 55 and older experiencing memory problems. This test, made by Fujirebio, offers a quicker and more accessible method for diagnosing Alzheimer's, potentially increasing diagnostic accuracy and enabling earlier treatment. The blood test will provide more accurate diagnoses and make the testing more accessible in rural and underserved areas. Early diagnosis will allow more patients to access amyloid-reducing drugs.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments following mounting political pressure, with more than 10 million pensioners losing out on the payments last year. The government will change the threshold to allow "more pensioners" to qualify again, though details remain unclear. The policy change will be announced at the autumn Budget, and ministers will only "make decisions we can afford." The move follows criticism from unions and pensioner charities, as well as concerns from Labour MPs about the policy's impact on local election results.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin briefly touched a new all-time high before slipping as rising Treasury yields pressured risk assets. The flagship cryptocurrency traded flat at $106,678.74 after reaching $109,857. Factors contributing to the new high included softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The market has benefited from both liquidity and risk-off scenarios, with investors anticipating further regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments. (not investment advice)</p>
