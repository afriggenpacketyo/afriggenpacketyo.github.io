          <p>Oliver Widger, known online as "sailing_with_phoenix," completed his journey from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat Phoenix, receiving a warm welcome from fans and Hawaii's Governor Josh Green. Widger, who quit his tire company job and used his retirement savings to buy a sailboat, gained a large social media following documenting his trip. Diagnosed with Klippel-Feil syndrome four years ago, Widger was inspired to pursue a life he enjoyed, teaching himself to sail via YouTube and refitting his $50,000 boat. He plans to repair his boat and possibly travel to French Polynesia next, expressing gratitude for the support he received during his journey.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to raise the annual salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to over 6 million yen (approximately $41,000) to attract talent as Japanese cuisine gains global popularity. The chefs, who often serve as live-in staff, will also have the option of government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role these chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, adding that recruiting qualified staff has become increasingly difficult. The ministry hopes the improved conditions will encourage chefs to proactively promote Japanese cuisine as 'food diplomats'.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government is emphasizing service improvements and reinvestment of profits into infrastructure, but is refraining from promising lower fares. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to deliver on their promises. SWR trains will now be managed by DfT Operator and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval.</p>

Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue expects staffing to increase as students finish classes and summer arrives, with 374 new lifeguards in training. The city is offering incentives like increased hourly wages and signing bonuses to attract more lifeguards. Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, while the city continues efforts to make training more accessible and improve lifeguard stations.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault,‚Äù passed away at the age of 90. Her influential book challenged the perception of sexual assault as an act of passion, reframing it as a crime of power and violence. "Against Our Will" offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault and contributed to legal reforms, including the criminalization of sexual assault within marriage and the implementation of rape shield laws. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in the feminist movement, advocating against the dehumanization of women in pornography.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's unique traditions, distinguishing it from the U.S., and is a stark contrast to Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming a 51st state. This invitation comes after Trump imposed tariffs that threatened Canada's economic stability. While much of Canada's population is indifferent to the British monarchy, Carney's government is signaling a stronger support for the Crown.</p>

The comb may hold DNA evidence of the high-status individual laid to rest more than a thousand years ago.
