          <p>A controversial temporary immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The closure follows a federal judge's order to wind down operations, which she upheld despite an appeal from the Trump administration and Florida officials. The judge was unpersuaded by arguments that the facility was necessary due to overcrowding elsewhere, noting its temporary design. The state is concurrently opening a new detention center called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>In a civil trial where a security guard is suing for $24 million, rapper Cardi B's defense was bolstered by testimony from a receptionist and a doctor. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleges the rapper assaulted her in a doctor's office hallway in 2018. However, the receptionist testified that she saw the guard cornering a pregnant Cardi B and that the guard was the aggressor, even causing a cut on the receptionist's own forehead. The doctor corroborated this account, stating he saw no injuries on the plaintiff's face.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its key policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. While holding rates, the central bank upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 from 0.8% to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2.0%. The decision reflects a cautious approach, balancing stable inflation and modest economic improvement against potential risks in the property market. This comes as the country benefits from easing trade headwinds following recent agreements with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, the former governor of China's central bank, has urged caution regarding the global enthusiasm for stablecoins, calling for a comprehensive assessment of their utility and systemic risks. While the U.S. and Hong Kong are developing regulatory frameworks, Zhou warned against their potential for excessive speculation, fraud, and financial instability. He cautioned that some industry players might be leveraging the hype for valuation purposes rather than sustainable business models. His comments suggest a measured approach from Beijing as it considers its own digital currency strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Unfounded Rumor of President Trump's Imminent Death</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok video claiming President Donald Trump has only six to eight months to live due to congestive heart failure and kidney disease has been determined to be unfounded. The claim originated from a physical therapist, not a medical doctor, who based his speculation on observations of Trump's appearance on camera. The White House has previously addressed these observations, stating in July 2025 that the President has chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, and remains in "excellent health." The rumor is not based on any clinical diagnosis.</p>

          <p>For the first time, all 32 NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year, according to a new report. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. However, only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the need to convert funds into tangible military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by continued high demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company also issued a strong sales forecast for the upcoming quarter, projecting revenue growth to remain above 50%. Despite the positive results, the stock price fell in extended trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year to $41.1 billion, fell slightly short of analysts' specific expectations for the second consecutive quarter.

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, President of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The position, which acts as a crucial link between film productions and city bureaucracy, had been vacant, causing frustration among industry advocates. The appointment is seen as a vital step to help streamline filming in L.A. at a time when the city faces intense competition for production jobs from other locations offering tax incentives and cheaper labor.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has stated there is a "real possibility" of introducing the company's advanced Blackwell AI processors to the Chinese market, pending U.S. government approval. This follows a deal where Nvidia received export licenses for its previous-generation H20 chip in exchange for a percentage of sales revenue going to the U.S. government. Huang emphasized the importance of American tech companies leading in the global AI race, arguing that supplying China with modified chips is preferable to forcing them to develop homegrown alternatives.

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering working parents in England 30 hours of funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to three years. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging eligible parents to apply for the program, which aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare. However, concerns persist within the sector about whether there are enough staff and available places to meet the increased demand. Some providers also warn that government funding rates are insufficient, forcing them to charge for extras.</p>
