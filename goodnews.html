Among the cargo were 1,500 tortillas, a preferred crumb-free bread substitute for astronauts in weightlessness. The Dragon spacecraft also brought an add-on thruster kit to help maintain the station's altitude, with re-boost operations planned to begin in September 2025.

          <p>Nvidia is preparing for its fiscal second-quarter earnings report, marking two years since generative AI began transforming its business, tripling revenue and quadrupling profits. The chipmaker recently achieved a $4 trillion market cap, driven largely by its data center revenue, which now accounts for 88% of total sales. Analysts anticipate a 53% year-over-year revenue jump to $45.9 billion, with strong performance from its Blackwell line expected to affirm its technological leadership. The company is also navigating U.S. export restrictions to China, impacting sales forecasts for its H20 chip.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to boost its struggling U.S. coffee division. Following the acquisition, expected in the first half of 2026, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies. This move would effectively unwind its 2018 merger, with the new coffee entity projected to generate $16 billion in annual sales. Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper fell 8% on the news, while JDE Peet's climbed 17%.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his intention to pursue more government deals like the recent acquisition of a 10% stake in Intel, which he says will benefit the U.S. economy. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett explained this is part of a broader strategy to establish a sovereign wealth fund, similar to those in other countries. The Intel stake, valued at $8.9 billion, combines CHIPS Act grants and other government allocations for secure chip programs. Trump asserts these deals will create jobs and wealth, despite the unusual nature of federal involvement in private corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

Roth IRAs provide greater flexibility, allowing penalty-free withdrawals of contributions anytime, but have lower limits ($7,000 in 2025) and income restrictions.
