          <p>Despite its stock price rising over 160% this year to reach an all-time high, financial services company Robinhood is confronting several significant challenges. The company is under investigation by Florida's Attorney General for allegedly misleading claims about its crypto trading costs and faces user pushback over a new 25% fee on crypto staking rewards. Additionally, Robinhood's push into tokenized stocks in Europe has drawn scrutiny from regulators and public objections from companies like OpenAI. These issues present potential obstacles to the platform's continued growth and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery to become a Civil War hero and U.S. congressman, is set to be erected on the South Carolina State House grounds. This will be the first monument dedicated to a Black individual at the state's capitol, a significant step in a location that features numerous statues of men tied to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. Smalls is celebrated for his daring act of commandeering a Confederate transport ship and delivering it to the Union Navy. The move represents a major moment of historical recognition and progress for the state.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly Gen Z, are using AI dating assistants to improve their chances in the competitive world of online dating. According to a recent study, one in four singles now use AI to craft witty opening lines, suggest replies, and maintain conversations on apps like Rizz and Keepler. These tools aim to boost confidence and provide objective advice, acting as a digital "wingman." While some users find it helpful for breaking the ice, the trend raises questions about authenticity and the risk of using AI as a substitute for genuine human connection rather than a supplement.</p>

As part of the plea agreement, Guzman Lopez admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation within the Sinaloa cartel.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000, driven by a significant surge in institutional investment. Bitcoin-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. This rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. The sustained institutional interest and positive market sentiment have pushed the cryptocurrency to its highest valuation since May, with analysts noting few macro catalysts to suppress the momentum.

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state of New Hampshire, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features that exploit children and teens. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok's platform is intentionally designed to maximize engagement for commercial benefit, putting young users at risk. The ruling allows the case to proceed, with the judge noting the claims are based on the app's "defective and dangerous features" rather than user-generated content. This follows a trend of legal actions targeting tech companies' design choices over content moderation.</p>
