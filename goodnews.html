Murrow's battle against Senator Joseph McCarthy. Clooney co-wrote the original screenplay and the play, which explores themes of truth, intimidation, and courage in corporate media during the 1950s. The play recreates the CBS newsroom of the 1950s and highlights the importance of journalism in holding government accountable. Clooney sees parallels between the play's themes and contemporary issues facing the news media, emphasizing the need for journalists to stand up against pressure from the government and corporations. </p>

          <p>Nine veterans with PTSD traveled to Mexico for a psychedelic retreat organized by the Heroic Hearts Project, where they participated in ceremonies using psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT. The retreat aimed to help veterans revisit traumatic moments and find relief from their symptoms, as traditional treatments had often proven ineffective. While one veteran experienced a decline in mental health following the retreat, eight others reported improvements and called the experience life-changing. The Veterans Administration is now conducting clinical trials using MDMA and psilocybin to treat PTSD, depression, and addiction, signaling a growing interest in the potential of psychedelic therapies. </p>

          <p>Hezbollah's losses in Lebanon and Syria have weakened Iran's influence in the Middle East, according to analysts. A Mossad operation involving explosive pagers and walkie-talkies decimated Hezbollah's leadership and military capabilities, leading to a ceasefire and a diminished role for the organization in Lebanon. The fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran, further isolated Hezbollah and cut off its access to critical supply routes. Experts believe that Iran's proxy war strategy, which relied on Hezbollah to exert influence in the region, has suffered a significant setback. </p>
