        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," explores themes of disappointing romantic encounters despite her recent rise to pop superstardom. The album continues the musical style of its predecessor, "Short n' Sweet," blending '70s-inspired pop with country and dance influences, produced alongside collaborators like Jack Antonoff. While some lyrics are seen as less sharp than her previous work, the album is praised for its clever songwriting and Carpenter's versatile vocal performance. The article highlights tracks like "Goodbye" and "House Tour" as standouts, showcasing her ability to mix comedy with sharp commentary on modern dating dynamics.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, American Taylor Townsend, during their US Open match. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend, accusing her of having "no education" in a dispute that began over a net cord incident. The comments drew criticism, with some interpreting them as racially insensitive, though Townsend did not believe so. In her apology, Ostapenko stated that English is not her native language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, not Townsend's general education, acknowledging her words could have been offensive.</p>

          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing updated guidance on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that recommendations vary by developmental stage. For toddlers, the consensus leans toward being screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world. As children enter kindergarten and elementary school, limited and supervised screen time of 30-60 minutes is suggested to foster imagination and social skills. While acknowledging the difficulty of monitoring adolescents, experts stress the importance of content quality over quantity and maintaining open communication to navigate the digital world safely, warning that excessive screen use can negatively impact language development and motor skills.</p>

          <p>In a unique collaboration, the Astra St. Pauli Brewery in Hamburg has partnered with spice company Hela to create a beer inspired by Germany's classic Currywurst snack. The limited-edition brew, named "Currydurst" (Currythirst), infuses a traditional Astra beer with the spicy and smoky flavor of Hela's iconic curry ketchup. The product is a tribute to Hamburg's street food culture, where Currywurst and beer are a popular combination. With only 2,000 liters being produced, the novel beverage is being marketed as an offbeat homage to a local culinary tradition, testing the taste buds of beer and sausage enthusiasts alike.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, the mayor's administration has proposed new regulations to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and increased inspection capacity for the health department.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a study across over 200 GP surgeries and found the device significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle heart sounds and electrical signals that are undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to the cloud for instant analysis. This technology is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner and improving outcomes.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair and starring Peter Dinklage, offers a more polished and emotionally grounded take on the Troma original. The film centers on Winston Goose (Dinklage), a janitor who, after being exposed to toxic waste, becomes a disfigured vigilante fighting a corrupt corporation run by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. While the remake retains the gore and goofy humor of the original, its higher production value and sincere character moments create a different experience. The article suggests it's a diverting homage that may be too well-made to be a true Troma tribute.</p>
