          <h2>Chevron to Reduce Share Buybacks Amid Falling Oil Prices and Global Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 13:47:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks in response to declining crude oil prices, which have been affected by President Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. The company intends to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its stock in the second quarter, a reduction from the $3.9 billion in the first quarter, while still maintaining its overall repurchase guidance for the year. Analysts suggest this decision reflects a cautious approach due to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Chevron's net income saw a significant decline, dropping over 30% compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri topped the practice session at the Miami Grand Prix, outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. The session was cut short due to a crash involving Oliver Bearman, which prevented some drivers, including Lando Norris and George Russell, from completing their soft-tyre runs. Verstappen is participating in the race following the birth of his daughter, Lily. The Miami Grand Prix also announced a new contract extending the race's presence on the Formula 1 calendar until 2041.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a surge following a better-than-expected US jobs report, which eased concerns about the impact of President Trump‚Äôs tariffs on the economy. The FTSE 100 achieved a record-winning streak, while European markets also rose sharply. The report indicated a slowdown in hiring compared to March but surpassed economists' expectations, fueling optimism about the resilience of the US economy. Despite the positive outlook, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised down previous months' gains, and federal government employment declined due to ongoing efforts to cut government workers.</p>

          <p>An article explores Finland's status as the happiest country in the world for eight years running, as measured by the World Happiness Report. The report is based on the Cantril Ladder, a survey question that asks respondents to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10. The article examines the factors contributing to Finland's high ranking, such as social cohesion, safety, and functional governance. The author contrasts Finland's approach to happiness with that of the United States, where happiness is often seen as a personal pursuit rather than a collective outcome.</p>
