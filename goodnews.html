          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were safely defused in Cologne, Germany, necessitating the evacuation of over 20,000 residents from the city center. The bombs, discovered during road construction preparations, included two 20-ton bombs and one 10-ton bomb, each with impact fuses. This operation marked the city's largest evacuation since the end of the war, highlighting the ongoing risk posed by unexploded ordnance in Germany. The successful defusal averted potential disaster and underscores the continued need for vigilance in areas affected by wartime air raids.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to terminate Kim Sajet, the Director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for D.E.I. initiatives as inappropriate. However, the National Portrait Gallery is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is independent of the federal government, complicating Trump's efforts. The power to remove Sajet rests with Lonnie G. Bunch III, the secretary of the Smithsonian, who is accountable to the Smithsonian‚Äôs Board of Regents. Trump's influence over the Smithsonian's leadership is limited, despite his expressed disdain for Sajet.</p>

          <p>Environmental groups argued before the California Supreme Court that the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law by slashing financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. The groups contend that the CPUC failed to consider all benefits of solar panels and ensure continued expansion in disadvantaged communities. State lawyers sided with utilities, arguing the credits caused a "cost shift" to non-solar customers, raising their bills. The justices questioned whether the appeals court erred in deferring to the CPUC's expertise, with a decision expected within 90 days.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of arrests were made across 28 states in a coordinated effort to combat organized retail theft. The initiative, led by the Cook County Regional Organized Crime Taskforce, involved over 100 law enforcement agencies and 30 major retailers. Retailers provided critical information to aid the crackdown on groups stealing merchandise for resale. Authorities say organized retail crime has become more sophisticated and widespread, leading to significant financial losses for retailers.</p>

          <p>Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants citizens control over their personal information collected by tech companies. This law allows individuals to request data deletion and access copies of collected data, aiming to shift power from tech giants to consumers. Companies operating in Europe must comply, facing potential fines for violations. This has inspired similar laws in other countries and California, prompting tech companies to support a U.S. privacy law with industry input, though critics remain skeptical of their commitment to meaningful change.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to address President Trump's neutralization of federal agencies protecting civil servants. With the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) unable to function due to Trump's firings, the court suggests federal courts should hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This proposal aims to close a legal loophole leaving civil servants unprotected, potentially reversing the Supreme Court's decisions favoring Trump's power over federal employees.
