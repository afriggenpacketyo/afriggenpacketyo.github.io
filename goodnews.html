          <h2>Researchers Propose Smoke-Dried Remains in Asia Are World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:24:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that human remains found across southeastern Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, may be the oldest known mummies. Researchers theorize that hunter-gatherer communities used a smoke-drying process over fire to preserve the bodies of their ancestors. This practice, far predating the well-known Egyptian or Chinchorro mummies, is believed to have sustained physical and spiritual connections with the deceased. The findings, though requiring more robust dating methods, offer significant insight into prehistoric funerary practices that continue in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade agreement with China is likely to be reached before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. In a recent interview, Bessent stated that talks have become increasingly productive and that Chinese officials now sense a deal is possible. The negotiations aim to address the significant U.S. trade deficit with China, which was nearly $300 billion in 2024. U.S. officials project the deficit will narrow by at least 30% this year, moving towards a more balanced and fair trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to let TikTok be banned in the U.S. was the crucial factor that motivated China to negotiate a deal framework. With a September 17 deadline looming for parent company ByteDance to divest the app's U.S. operations, Bessent revealed that the commercial terms had been essentially agreed upon for months but were stalled by China after Trump's tariff announcements. The potential deal, which may involve Oracle and other investors, could mark a turning point in U.S.-China relations, with the two presidents expected to speak to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for public bodies to fail to cooperate or act with honesty and integrity. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law, championed by families of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster victims, aims to end a "culture of cover-ups" and will serve victims of other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal. Campaigners have welcomed the news, calling it a momentous step for British justice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a cooling job market and economic uncertainty, a trend known as "job hugging" has emerged, where employees are clinging to their current positions rather than seeking new opportunities. The "quits" rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, reflecting workers' fears of potential layoffs and the difficulty of finding new employment. Career experts advise that while staying put can provide security, it also carries the risk of complacency.

          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks as the largest in China, is now expanding into the United States with five initial locations in New York City. The company operates with a cashierless model, requiring customers to order via a mobile app where they are offered significant discounts and coupons. This growth strategy focuses on building brand awareness, even if it means initial stores operate at a loss, a stark contrast to Starbucks's profit-focused model. Despite a history of accounting fraud that led to its delisting from the Nasdaq in 2020, Luckin has rebounded under new leadership and now aims to challenge its American rival on its home turf.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical overview of Zionism, arguing that it should be understood as a complex 19th-century nationalist movement rather than a monolithic ideology. It traces the movement's origins to the 1897 congress in Basel, Switzerland, led by Theodor Herzl, highlighting the diverse viewpoints among early Zionists regarding statehood, religion, and political strategy. The author notes that, like other nationalist movements of its era, Zionism was multifaceted and often failed to adequately consider the existing Arab population in Palestine. The article concludes by emphasizing that viewing Zionism through its history reveals an ongoing internal debate over its identity and future, including progressive voices advocating for Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Sources familiar with the negotiations report that technology company Oracle is part of a consortium of firms that would enable TikTok to continue its U.S. operations if a deal is finalized between the United States and China. The precise structure remains unclear, but the agreement is expected to involve multiple companies, with questions still surrounding the level of control Chinese parent company ByteDance would retain. Oracle, co-founded by Trump ally Larry Ellison, has long been considered a potential partner and has already been working with TikTok to route U.S. user data through its servers to address national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to launch a new investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to three separate courts. The case revolves around MI5's handling of a neo-Nazi informant, "Agent X," who used his protected status to coerce and attack his girlfriend. The Security Service had falsely claimed to courts that it had not confirmed the agent's identity to the BBC, a position it maintained until a journalist produced a recording proving otherwise. Previous internal inquiries were deemed to have "serious procedural deficiencies" by the High Court, prompting this new, independent investigation.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has released promising late-stage trial results for Cagrilinitide, a potential next-generation obesity treatment. The study showed that patients using the once-weekly injection achieved an average weight loss of 11.8% after 68 weeks, compared to just 2.3% for those on a placebo. This new drug works differently from existing treatments like Wegovy, mimicking a hormone that increases feelings of fullness, and was described as being "well-tolerated" with mainly mild side effects. The results are a positive step for Novo Nordisk as it seeks alternatives to its blockbuster drugs amid supply constraints and growing competition.</p>

          <p>This long-form article revisits the legendary 1975 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in the Philippines, widely regarded as one of the greatest fights in history. It explores the deep personal enmity that had curdled from an early friendship, fueled by Ali's vicious taunts and the high stakes of their rivalry. The piece also examines the political backdrop, with the fight being used as a propaganda tool by the autocratic regime of Ferdinand Marcos. The "Thrilla in Manila" is remembered not just for its brutal, elemental test of human endurance, but as a complex narrative of sport, society, and the souls of two iconic fighters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled 2-1 that President Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, a significant blow to the administration. Trump had announced he was firing Cook, a Biden appointee, on grounds of alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies. The ruling allows Cook to participate in this week's pivotal policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. This case tests the long-standing independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference, as no president has ever removed a Fed governor, and the legal definition of removal "for cause" remains undefined.

          <p>New figures show that the number of UK pensioners receiving winter fuel payments dropped from around 11 million to just 1.3 million last year after the government introduced means-testing. The controversial policy, which restricted payments to those on low-income benefits, sparked a significant backlash. In response, the chancellor announced a U-turn in June, restoring the payment for pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less. This reversal means that more than three-quarters of pensioners, or about nine million people, will again receive the payment of up to £300 this winter to help with high energy bills.</p>

          <p>Researchers have scientifically confirmed the source of a vibrant turquoise blue color in Jackson Pollock's famous 1948 painting, "Number 1A." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, they created a chemical fingerprint identifying the pigment as manganese blue, a synthetic color phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, not only solves an artistic mystery but also demonstrates how scientific analysis helps in the conservation and authentication of valuable artworks.</p>
