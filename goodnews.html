          <p>With persistent inflation challenging savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to earn returns that outpace inflation. Locking in high rates for the CD's term provides a safe investment option, generally insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. Currently, short-term CDs (six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of these high rates while also saving for the long term (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>Elon Musk's departure from his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) places his efforts within a historical context of presidential administrations attempting to streamline government. Previous presidents, including Clinton and Reagan, also sought to reduce waste and improve efficiency, with varying degrees of success. Clinton established the National Performance Review (NPR) and Reagan implemented the Grace Commission to study cost-cutting. These efforts faced resistance from within the government bureaucracy, highlighting the challenges of implementing significant reforms. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a national average savings account interest rate of 0.42%, high-yield savings accounts offer significantly better returns, ranging from 4.10% to 4.40%. Online banks often provide these higher rates due to lower overhead costs, making them an attractive option for savers. Comparing different accounts and considering factors beyond interest rates, such as fees, is crucial for maximizing savings. Opening a high-yield savings account is a wise financial move for both emergency funds and general savings (not investment advice). </p>

CEO Kelly Ortberg stated that Chinese airlines confirmed plans to take deliveries this month after a 90-day trade truce was agreed upon in May. However, escalating tariffs between the U.S. and China in April had previously led some Chinese airlines to refuse Boeing plane deliveries.
