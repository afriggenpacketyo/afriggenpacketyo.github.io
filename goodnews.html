          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that's transforming microchip manufacturing. This advanced machine, bigger than a double-decker bus, uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography to project smaller chip designs with higher resolution and improved yield. Intel, TSMC, and Samsung are among the first to use High NA, which reduces cycle time by 60% and improves performance. Despite the high cost, ASML aims to drive down chip prices by increasing speed and performance, and the company nearly failed before proving the viability of EUV technology, a risky investment that took over 20 years to develop.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lenovo Group reported strong annual results driven by demand for AI PCs, with revenue up 21% and net income increasing 37%. However, the company's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, expressed concern over unexpected tariffs imposed by the US, which heavily impacted their most recent quarter and prevented even stronger profit growth. The sudden implementation of these tariffs in March caught Lenovo off guard, leaving them with little time to prepare, and investors reacted negatively, causing Lenovo's Hong Kong-listed shares to fall. This development highlights the ongoing challenges faced by tech companies amid US-China trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, diverging from Bitcoin's typical correlation with equities, and investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability, and JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon stated that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, dropping to 431,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was driven by fewer people coming to work and study, changes introduced by the previous Conservative government, and departures of those who arrived on study visas after the pandemic. There was also a significant drop in dependents accompanying work and study visa holders. Home Office data indicates a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, though numbers remain higher than when Labour came to power.</p>
