          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an alternative to traditional Pap smears. The test, developed by Teal Health, involves a vaginal swab to detect HPV, the virus responsible for most cervical cancers. This at-home option aims to improve accessibility for women who face barriers to in-person appointments. If the test is positive, a follow-up with a health care provider is necessary, but a negative result means no further screening is needed for several years, marking a significant step in preventative healthcare.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. The judge, William K.

          <p>Indiana Governor Mike Braun has signed a bill that threatens to strip charity hospitals of their non-profit status if they continue to charge high prices.

The Indiana Hospital Association expressed concerns about the potential loss of non-profit status due to factors like rising costs and inflation.</p>
