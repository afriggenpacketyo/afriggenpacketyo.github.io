          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:06:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eight key OPEC+ member nations, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase their collective oil output by 548,000 barrels per day in August. This move, which is larger than the anticipated 411,000 barrels, is a response to a steady global economic outlook and healthy market fundamentals, including low oil inventories. The decision accelerates the unwinding of voluntary production cuts that were previously implemented to stabilize the market. This production hike aims to balance supply with rising summer demand and mitigate recent price volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Medical Experts Discuss Whether Caffeinated Sodas Can Alleviate Migraines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 07:00:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the claim that drinking soda, particularly Coke, can cure migraines, a condition affecting 39 million Americans. Doctors indicate that the caffeine in these beverages can act as a nerve disruptor and constrict blood vessels, which may provide temporary relief for some individuals, similar to how caffeine is an ingredient in some painkillers. However, they caution that caffeine can also be a migraine trigger and that relying on sugary sodas is not a cure and can worsen underlying issues over time. Experts suggest healthier alternatives like water with electrolytes, magnesium, or organic coffee for managing headaches.</p>

          <p>Reverend William Barber is leading a revived Poor People's Campaign, a national "moral movement" using nonviolent protest to challenge poverty and systemic injustice under the current political landscape. Drawing on religious tradition, Barber frames policy decisions that harm the poor, such as cuts to healthcare and food aid, as "policy murder." His fusion movement brings together diverse groups to create a moral force aimed at reshaping the nation by confronting not just a single administration, but the deeper political theology that weds nationalism to capitalism. The article questions whether this approach can effectively counter the current assault on democracy and rights.</p>

          <p>FICO has announced it will begin incorporating buy now, pay later (BNPL) loan data into its credit scoring models, a change that could impact millions of consumers. For users who make timely payments, this could help build a positive credit history, especially for younger individuals or those with limited credit. However, it also means that late payments or accumulating too much BNPL debt could negatively affect credit scores, a fair consequence according to experts. While the new scoring model will be available in fall 2025, widespread adoption by lenders is expected to be gradual. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Research Suggests Impotence Drugs Like Viagra May Have Cancer-Fighting Properties</h2>

          <p>A new study by researchers from several prominent Chinese institutions suggests that sildenafil, the active ingredient in Viagra, could help fight cancer. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the drug may work by strengthening dendritic cells, which are crucial anti-tumor immune cells that often become depleted as cancer progresses. By potentially reversing this process and restoring these "intelligence agents" of the immune system, sildenafil could represent a new form of tumor immunotherapy. The discovery is being hailed as a significant breakthrough with the potential to save lives.</p>

          <p>The community in Pasadena, California, showed up in force to support Christopher Luna Garcia, a 14-year-old who took over his mother's tamale cart after she became fearful following a recent immigration sweep. After a community activist shared his story on social media, hundreds of customers lined up, buying out all 500 of his tamales and raising over $1,500 for his family. The event highlights a trend of American-born children stepping up to run family businesses for parents intimidated by the federal immigration crackdown. It also served as a moment of solidarity for residents unnerved by the enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>Hamas has provided a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-led proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, stating it is ready to enter negotiations immediately. However, a senior Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested several changes, including a halt to a U.S.-backed aid system and a U.S. guarantee that the war will not resume if talks fail. The 60-day ceasefire plan reportedly includes the phased release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase in humanitarian aid. The Israeli government has not yet commented on the response.</p>

          <p>Following images of a UK Chancellor crying in public, this article explores the evolving perceptions of showing emotion in the workplace. While some still view crying as a sign of weakness, particularly in male-dominated fields, many executive coaches and employees argue it is simply human. They contend that in the modern workplace, emotional intelligence is a strength and that employers who show compassion are more likely to have motivated and loyal staff. The piece highlights personal stories from both men and women, suggesting a cultural shift towards accepting vulnerability as a part of professional life.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into institutional finance, moving beyond speculative trading to become core infrastructure. Major players like Robinhood, Deutsche Bank, and BlackRock are now building on Ethereum or its Layer 2 networks to offer tokenized stocks, funds, and other real-world assets. Despite price volatility, institutions are drawn to Ethereum's stability, security, and decade-long track record of uninterrupted operation. This shift suggests Ethereum is solidifying its role as the trusted settlement layer for the future of tokenized finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved a new milestone in renewable energy with the launch of a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao. The project, developed by state-owned Sinopec, is part of a broader initiative that will become the largest of its kind. Together, the offshore facilities are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, significantly reducing carbon emissions. By placing the solar panels on the ocean's surface, their efficiency is boosted by up to 8% due to the cooling effect of the water, marking a significant breakthrough for the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the long-standing debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently, using optical illusions as a case study. One recent study suggests people from "carpentered" Western environments see angular shapes where those from rural Namibia see circles. However, another study convincingly debunks this hypothesis for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion. The author, a perception researcher, concludes that while perceptual diversity is real, it exists within cultures as much as between them, and our experience is always an active brain construction, not a direct window onto reality.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, public swimming is officially permitted in Paris's Seine River. Authorities have opened three designated and supervised swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and amenities, as part of the legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The reopening follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort to improve water quality, which had been contaminated by pollution for decades. This initiative aims to adapt the city to climate change and enhance the quality of life for residents and tourists, fulfilling a promise first made by former mayor Jacques Chirac in 1988.</p>
