          <p>The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a 25-year trade agreement providing duty-free access to the US market for 35 sub-Saharan African nations, is expiring. While the deal boosted sectors like textiles and created jobs, its overall impact has been mixed, with some experts arguing it served US interests and created dependency. The expiration is now seen by some as a historic opportunity for Africa to diversify its trade relationships, strengthening partnerships with China and the EU, and bolstering the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to foster economic sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has announced a phased resumption of manufacturing at its UK facilities, starting with its engine plant, after a cyberattack forced a complete halt to operations. The shutdown has placed immense financial pressure on the company's supply chain, with many smaller firms at risk of bankruptcy. While the restart is welcome news, suppliers emphasize that financial assistance is still crucial to recover from the significant losses incurred during the stoppage, even with a £1.5 billion government-backed loan guarantee intended to support the supply chain.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's plans to overhaul the H-1B visa program by imposing hefty fees, this article highlights that many prominent leaders in the US tech industry began their careers on this very visa. Figures such as Elon Musk of Tesla, Satya Nadella of Microsoft, and Eric Yuan of Zoom all utilized the H-1B program, which allows US companies to hire foreign talent in specialized fields. While some of these leaders have advocated for reforms to the system, their stories underscore the program's historical role in attracting and retaining talent that has been foundational to major American companies.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a proposal to require its officers and staff to declare membership in the Freemasons, adding it to a list of declarable associations. The move follows a recommendation from a report on an unsolved murder, which cited concerns that membership could compromise investigations, promotions, and misconduct proceedings. The Metropolitan Police Federation has raised opposition, arguing the policy could violate officers' human rights to privacy and freedom of association, while the force maintains it is a step toward strengthening public trust.</p>

          <p>A recent trend shows more young men than women desire to be parents, a shift that may be understood by examining the evolving portrayal of fathers in pop culture, particularly on television. According to TV critic Phillip Maciak, the image of the American dad has transformed from the stoic 1950s figure like Ward Cleaver to more involved and emotionally available co-parents like Cliff Huxtable. This article explores how sitcoms have both reflected and shaped societal ideals of fatherhood, making the role more malleable and appealing to a new generation of men.</p>

          <p>In a "60 Minutes" interview, UFC President Dana White shared details of a brief, respectful conversation he had with former President Barack Obama during Donald Trump's inauguration. White, a vocal Trump supporter, recounted that Obama was the only former president to approach him, shaking his hand and congratulating him on his success.

          <p>The fashion world paid tribute to the late Giorgio Armani with a special show in Milan for the spring/summer 2026 collection, the last one the designer personally worked on before his death at 91. Originally planned as a 50th-anniversary celebration, the event became a memorial, attended by stars like Cate Blanchett and Richard Gere. The collection, showcased by models from across the designer's five-decade career, drew inspiration from Milan and the island of Pantelleria, culminating in a standing ovation for a final gown featuring an image of Armani's face.</p>

          <p>The pro-European party of Moldovan President Maia Sandu has won a clear majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as critical for the nation's path toward EU integration. The election was overshadowed by widespread accusations of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and vote-buying schemes, aimed at destabilizing the country. European leaders welcomed the result as a clear choice for democracy and freedom, while the pro-Russian opposition, which has called for protests, disputes the outcome.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is set to announce a new policy requiring legal migrants to "earn" the right to permanent settlement by demonstrating their contribution to society. Under the Labour government's proposal, applicants for indefinite leave to remain would need to learn English to a high standard, maintain a clean criminal record, and perform community volunteering. This policy aims to create a clear distinction from the rival Reform UK party's proposal to abolish permanent settlement status altogether, framing Labour's approach as one of "fair migration."</p>

          <p>In a significant move to mitigate financial risks, China's Henan province has approved the consolidation of 82 smaller rural financial institutions into a new entity, the Henan Rural Commercial Bank. The new bank will absorb all assets, liabilities, and operations of the merged entities, which include rural commercial banks, credit cooperatives, and village banks. This action addresses growing concerns about the vulnerability of China's smaller, locally-focused banks, which are disproportionately exposed to economic downturns and the country's persistent real estate crisis.

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive ranking of all films by director Paul Thomas Anderson, from "Hard Eight" to his latest, "One Battle After Another." The author argues that while every film in his body of work demonstrates an exceptionally high level of craft and a deep humanism, they can be ordered based on their relative impact and artistic achievement. The list places early works like "Boogie Nights" and "Magnolia" in the middle, while crowning his epic story of American capitalism, "There Will Be Blood," as his most accomplished and visionary film to date.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singer-songwriter Amanda Shires' new album, "Nobody's Girl," is a deeply personal and honest exploration of the grief and rebuilding process following her high-profile divorce from musician Jason Isbell. The album deviates from typical heartbreak narratives by focusing on the immediate, messy aftermath of a breakup, capturing the rawness of being erased from a shared history and the difficult quest for personal closure. Through songs that are both vulnerable and resilient, Shires transforms her pain into a work of art that serves as a relatable guide for navigating profound loss.</p>
