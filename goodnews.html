          <p>An 18th-century painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Italian artist Giuseppe Ghislandi, has been recovered in Argentina 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis. The artwork was discovered after being spotted in a photo on an estate agent's website, hanging in the home of the daughter of a high-ranking Nazi official. The painting, which was part of the collection of Amsterdam art dealer Jacques Goudstikker, has been returned by the family's lawyer. The couple who possessed it are now under house arrest and may face charges for concealing stolen art linked to genocide.</p>

          <p>Drawing from personal experience as both a former police detective and a recent car crash victim, an article provides essential steps to take immediately following a collision. Key advice includes stopping the car, turning off the engine, and checking for injuries before doing anything else. If possible, vehicles should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on. The guidance stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured, if the other party leaves the scene, or if the accident is causing a significant road obstruction, offering a clear protocol for a stressful situation.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between the Department of Justice and North Carolina's state board of elections, preventing approximately 98,000 voters from being removed from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's DOJ, which had demanded the state disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial Social Security number. Intervening in the case, the Democratic National Committee argued the move violated federal law, leading to a compromise that allows these individuals to vote using a provisional ballot while providing the required information at the polls.</p>

          <p>Following a public plea for wider distribution amid financial challenges, C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV. The nonprofit public affairs network, which provides unfiltered coverage of Congress, has faced declining revenue as traditional pay-TV subscriptions shrink. The new deals will expand access to C-SPAN's three channels for millions of streaming subscribers, a move supported by a U.S. Senate resolution urging streaming services to carry the network. This expansion is crucial for the financial stability and reach of the privately funded organization.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova achieved a career-defining victory by defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-4, 6-3 to advance to the US Open semifinals. The win marks a dramatic turnaround for Anisimova, who had suffered a severe 6-0, 6-0 loss to Swiatek in the Wimbledon final just weeks earlier. Displaying fearless and aggressive baseline play, Anisimova overcame an early break to control the match, becoming the first American woman since the Williams sisters in 2002 to reach the semifinals on all three Grand Slam surfaces. The victory is a cathartic moment following her mental-health hiatus in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed by parents five years ago concerning educational failures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The agreement will provide high-intensity tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The original lawsuit alleged that the district failed to provide adequate live instruction and technology, disproportionately harming Black and Latino students. The settlement also mandates regular assessments, teacher training, and more transparent public reporting on student progress and attendance.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a bloc including China, Russia, and Iran, is advancing plans for a development bank, signaling a move to create financial systems less vulnerable to U.S. sanctions and pressure. During a recent summit, China pledged $1.4 billion in loans to member states, emphasizing the rejection of a "Cold War mentality." For Iran, integration into SCO financial frameworks is particularly crucial as it faces the potential reinstatement of severe international sanctions. This initiative represents a strategic effort by the bloc to shift the global financial order and enhance economic resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has spared Google from the most severe potential penalty in its antitrust case, ruling that the company will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. While the judge had previously deemed Google a monopolist in online search, the remedies imposed were less drastic than feared, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. The ruling does place other limits on the tech giant, including a requirement to share some of its valuable search data with certain rivals to help restore competition. The decision comes as the rise of AI chatbots presents a new competitive challenge to Google's search dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 18:00:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University was illegal. The court found that the administration violated the university's First Amendment rights by imposing the freeze in retaliation for Harvard's refusal to comply with ideologically motivated demands, such as ending its diversity programs. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the administration used concerns about antisemitism as a pretext for a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling vacates the freeze orders and bars the administration from enforcing them, restoring critical funding for numerous research projects.</p>
