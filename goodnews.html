          <p>The Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to hold a bilateral meeting in the coming days, with the specific date and location yet to be disclosed. The confirmation follows a visit to Moscow by White House special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Trump described as a "highly productive" step toward resolving the war in Ukraine. This development occurs as an August 8th deadline approaches, which Trump had set for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face the possibility of severe secondary sanctions on its energy exports.</p>

The reigning world player of the year will feature in a near full-strength lineup against France, having missed the previous Six Nations victory over the same opponent due to injury. The team sees 11 changes from its recent dominant win over Spain, with key players like Zoe Harrison, Abby Dow, and captain Zoe Aldcroft all starting.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million. The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is expected to undergo a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64 million but struggled to secure a consistent starting position in the recent title-winning season. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, as they look to reshape their squad.</p>

          <p>In response to a query about curbing consumerism, people have shared various personal strategies for resisting the urge to make unnecessary purchases. Common tactics include implementing a waiting period by leaving items in an online cart or on a wishlist to see if the desire fades over time. Others transform the urge into a game by 'window shopping' with an imaginary budget or visiting a library to get the thrill of acquisition without spending money. These tips reflect a growing desire for more intentional spending and finding fulfillment in non-materialistic ways, from visiting thrift stores to appreciating nature.</p>

          <p>The tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) has transitioned from a niche hobby into a major form of spectator entertainment, with live-play shows selling out arenas like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as "actual play," features comedians and actors playing the game for large online and in-person audiences. Shows like 'Dimension 20' and 'Critical Role' have attracted millions of viewers, fueling a golden age for the game itself. The diversity of players in these popular shows is credited with bringing in new, more varied audiences and inspiring more people to start their own D&D groups at home.</p>

          <p>The National Football League has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing significant safety reasons. The league's decision is based on FDA warnings and the concern that the substance, made of ammonium carbonate, can mask the symptoms of a concussion, a frequent injury in the sport. While some athletes use smelling salts for a quick jolt of alertness, there is no scientific evidence they enhance performance. Experts warn that their use can also worsen head and neck injuries by causing an involuntary jolt, and the long-term effects of repeated inhalation remain unknown.</p>

          <p>China and Pakistan are set to expand their technological collaboration into new strategic areas, including nuclear power for agriculture, space exploration, and artificial intelligence. The agreement was discussed during a meeting between officials from both nations, building on existing cooperation in energy infrastructure. A key part of their current partnership is the Karachi nuclear power facility, which features two of China's domestically developed Hualong One reactors. This deepening of ties signifies a strategic alignment to leverage Chinese technology for peaceful applications and further development in Pakistan.</p>

          <h2>Experts Propose Strategies for Fireproofing Forests in a Hotter, Drier World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, experts are advocating for new forest management strategies to enhance fire resilience. The best natural defense is a healthy, native deciduous forest, which is less flammable than the monoculture pine or eucalyptus plantations common in many regions. Short-term solutions include reducing fuel loads through controlled burns or grazing, and creating wide, vegetation-free firebreaks to slow a fire's spread. These proactive measures, combined with rapid detection technology, are seen as essential for adapting to a world where devastating fires are becoming more common.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has reported its second straight quarter of profit, exceeding analyst expectations with a gain of $4.8 billion in its technology-focused Vision Fund. This positive performance was largely driven by valuation increases in its public holdings, such as ride-hailing firm Grab, and private investments in Indian companies. The results come as SoftBank makes significant investments in artificial intelligence, including a proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing. However, the group's overall profit was weighed down by investment losses from the sale of its shares in T-Mobile and Alibaba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major retrospective exhibition in Bonn, Germany, is celebrating the expansive, five-decade career of acclaimed filmmaker Wim Wenders as he approaches his 80th birthday. Known for iconic films like "Paris, Texas" and "Wings of Desire," Wenders has built a body of work revolving around themes of movement, discovery, and quiet emotional journeys. He describes his creative process as an "art of getting lost," believing that true observation and understanding come from abandoning oneself to unfamiliar places. The exhibition showcases his work across film, photography, and writing, reflecting his enduring influence on cinema.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues for 'Letting Go' of Control in an Uncertain World</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 03:00:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that in an increasingly complex and unstable world, political leaders and institutions must shift away from a mindset of rigid control and embrace uncertainty. The author suggests that authoritarian tendencies and top-down, rules-based bureaucracy stifle the creative, collaborative thinking needed to address major crises like climate change and declining trust in politics. Drawing on neuroscience and psychology, the piece posits that while the human brain is wired for certainty, a conscious effort to 'let go' can foster humility, pluralist thinking, and more effective, democratic solutions to the world's most wicked problems.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has raised its full-year financial guidance after posting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits, citing resilient global demand. The company, a key barometer for global trade, noted a manufacturing boom in China and strong export growth nearly everywhere except for the United States, where tariff uncertainty has had a dampening effect. Maersk now projects global container market volume to grow between 2% and 4%, an upgrade from its previous forecast. The improved outlook also assumes that disruptions in the Red Sea will continue for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
