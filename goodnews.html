          <p>President Trump announced a "productive" phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which they reportedly approved a deal for TikTok's US operations to be sold to a group of American investors. While Trump indicated a deal was close, China's official state news agency, Xinhua, stated Xi merely "welcomes negotiations," suggesting the outcome remains less certain. A key sticking point in the ongoing negotiations appears to be the ownership and licensing of TikTok's powerful algorithm. Many US lawmakers, including some Republicans, continue to express unease due to ByteDance's perceived links with the Chinese Communist Party, despite Trump now viewing the platform as crucial for his 2024 electoral campaign.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. Current projections indicate Gabrielle is expected to remain over open waters, north of the Caribbean islands, with potential impacts to Bermuda early next week. Despite initial NOAA predictions for a busier-than-average season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far, with only one of the six previous named storms making US landfall. Forecasters will continue to monitor the storm's path and intensity, though no immediate land hazards have been warned.</p>

          <p>Tejasvi Manoj, a 17-year-old from Plano, Texas, has developed an innovative AI-powered website and app called "Shield Seniors" to help older adults avoid pervasive financial scams. Inspired by her grandfather's near-scam experience, Manoj actively teaches seniors about identifying and reporting online fraud, noting the increasing sophistication of scammers using artificial intelligence. Her impactful initiative, which earned her recognition on the cover of Time magazine as "Kid of the Year," aims to significantly raise cybersecurity awareness among the elderly, a demographic that collectively lost a staggering $4.8 billion to scams in 2024. Manoj, largely self-taught in coding and AI, plans to continue leveraging technology for social good and hopes to launch Shield Seniors fully by year-end.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, has become a pivotal testing ground for Chinese exporters strategically shifting their focus towards burgeoning Southeast Asian markets. Faced with slowing demand in traditional Western economies and geopolitical instabilities elsewhere, many companies now view the region's rapidly growing economies and young consumer base as a significant opportunity for overseas expansion. This strategic pivot aims to diversify their market reach and sustain growth. The annual event provides a crucial platform for these firms to engage with potential buyers and establish a stronger, more resilient presence in the dynamic Southeast Asian market, reflecting a broader recalibration of global trade strategies.

          <h2>Judge Dismisses Trump's $15 Billion Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling the 85-page complaint was "decidedly improper and impermissible" and an effort to attack political adversaries. The judge criticized the lawsuit's excessive length and "tedious and burdensome" language, deeming it irrelevant to the legal merits of the complaint. While the judge did not rule on the substance of Trump's case, he granted his lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint, emphasizing the necessity for it to be professional, dignified, and concise, not a political megaphone. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, asserting the original complaint was a political document.</p>

          <p>Sculptor Martin Jennings, chosen to create the central statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial in central London's St James's Park, aims to capture her "grandeur and dignity." Jennings, renowned for his previous depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, expressed elation at the commission, emphasizing the late monarch's global admiration for her steadfast devotion to duty. The final design, slated for revelation in 2026, will be part of a broader re-landscaped section of the park, featuring a bridge inspired by her wedding tiara and statues of both the Queen and Prince Philip. While anti-monarchy groups advocate for the Royal Family to fund the memorial, the project proceeds with a focus on historical reverence.</p>

          <p>A significant surge in US tech investment, including multi-billion-pound commitments from Microsoft and Google, is seen as a potential catalyst for the UK economy, particularly in artificial intelligence. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK an "AI superpower," highlighting its rich history of tech research. This "Tech Prosperity Deal" signals a soft alignment with the US administration's pro-growth approach to AI, contrasting with previous regulatory hurdles. While former Deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg criticizes the UK for "clinging to Uncle Sam's coattails," the influx of capital is expected to fuel innovation, especially in the Oxford-Cambridge-London "Golden Triangle," though concerns remain about job displacement and potential over-reliance on US tech giants.
