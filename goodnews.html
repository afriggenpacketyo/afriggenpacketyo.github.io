        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from the UK's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between student absences during the first week of the school year and subsequent persistent truancy. According to the figures, 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to prioritize attendance from the very start of the term to improve educational outcomes and prevent long-term disruption. This focus comes as schools continue to address attendance challenges that worsened after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are in Tianjin, China, for a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, a gathering overshadowed by their respective trade conflicts with the United States. Ahead of the main summit, Modi is holding his first talks in China in seven years with President Xi Jinping. The event comes as President Trump has imposed steep tariffs on Indian goods and as Putin faces ongoing pressure over the war in Ukraine. The SCO, created in 2001 by China, Russia, and Central Asian nations, serves as a regional counterweight to Western alliances like NATO.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has described her choice to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as "by far the best decision I have ever made." The 32-year-old stated she could not give 100% mentally or physically after a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble. Bright, who captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final, revealed she had been ignoring ongoing issues and realized she was on the verge of a breakdown. After undergoing knee surgery and starting counseling, she now feels rejuvenated and ready for the new Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>Receding water levels in Iraq's Mosul Dam reservoir, a consequence of a severe multi-year drought, have revealed approximately 40 ancient tombs. Archaeologists leading the excavation believe the tombs date back over 2,300 years to the Hellenistic or Hellenistic-Seleucid period. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and daily life, it has paradoxically created opportunities for archaeological discovery in areas previously submerged. The team is now working to excavate and preserve the artifacts at the Duhok Museum before water levels rise again, highlighting the complex impact of climate change on the nation's rich historical landscape.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10th anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s declaration "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly reshaped German society and politics, and its consequences remain a central topic of national debate. While data shows nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave had found employment by 2022, challenges persist, with migrants facing higher unemployment rates. The anniversary comes as the current government, led by Friedrich Merz of Merkel's own party, has adopted a more restrictive stance on immigration, signaling a significant policy shift.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that it is vital for the two nations to be good friends. Xi referred to China and India as the "dragon" and the "elephant," stating that the world's two most populous countries and key members of the Global South should come together. In his own remarks, Modi noted that relations have been moving in a positive direction and that he is committed to advancing them based on mutual trust and respect. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, occurring at a time of growing geopolitical and economic challenges.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment near the California-Oregon border, biologists are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolves by broadcasting sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and dialogue from films. This modern hazing technique, developed by the USDA, aims to provide a nonlethal solution to the increasing conflicts between ranchers and the recovering wolf population. Preliminary studies show that the novel sounds, including live human voices projected from the drones, can successfully interrupt wolf hunts. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, the method offers a creative approach to wildlife management as wolf populations continue to expand across the western U.S.</p>

          <p>With both India and China facing significant economic pressure from high U.S. tariffs, the leaders of the two nations are meeting with a potential relationship reset in mind. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit comes as his country's export sector is threatened by new U.S. levies. Similarly, Chinese President Xi Jinping is navigating a sluggish economy hampered by trade disputes. This shared challenge could push the two regional rivals, whose relationship has been strained by border disputes and mutual mistrust, toward greater economic cooperation to counterbalance their dependence on Western markets.</p>

Sun highlighted Tron's efficiency, processing transactions in seconds compared to the days it can take Swift, as a key advantage. His comments reflect the growing influence of blockchain technology, particularly in the realm of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar.
