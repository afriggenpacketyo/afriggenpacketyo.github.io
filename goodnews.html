          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian dissident recently released after five years in prison, spoke out against the Lukashenko regime, detailing the harsh conditions he and other political prisoners faced. Tsikhanouski described being denied access to lawyers, priests, and basic necessities, stating that political prisoners were treated worse than murderers. He also urged Donald Trump to help free the remaining 1,100 political prisoners in Belarus, emphasizing the need to continue fighting against Lukashenko to prevent the country from becoming a "desert." Tsikhanouski intends to reactivate his YouTube channel and publish files related to his criminal proceedings, while his wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, pledges to continue her fight for the release of all political prisoners and democratic elections. Tsikhanouski believes Belarus's liberation is tied to the collapse of the Putin regime.</p>

          <p>UFC legend Georges St. Pierre voiced his hope for Conor McGregor's return to the Octagon, highlighting the positive impact McGregor has on the sport. St. Pierre emphasized that McGregor brings significant attention and revenue to UFC, making his fights beneficial for everyone involved. McGregor has been out of action for nearly four years since breaking his leg in a fight against Dustin Poirier in 2021, and his scheduled return against Michael Chandler at UFC 303 was canceled due to a broken toe. St. Pierre hopes that McGregor's comeback happens if it genuinely makes him happy and is what he wants to do, despite Dana White's opposition to hosting fights in stadiums, which McGregor desires.</p>

          <p>Beginner gold investors should consider strategic steps before investing in gold, given its role as an income protector rather than a traditional income producer. Key decisions include whether to wait for a price drop, how much of the portfolio to allocate to gold, and assessing the portfolio's specific needs. Factors driving the price of gold suggest making these decisions sooner rather than later, potentially consulting with a financial advisor or gold investing company.

          <p>President Trump attended a NATO summit in The Hague amidst ongoing tensions with Iran, following his announcement of a ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel. Trump aimed to secure a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised Trump's actions in Iran and the new defense spending levels. Russia's war on Ukraine remains a top concern for NATO members, and the summit focused on collective defense and individual defense of all Allies. While Trump hoped to secure defense spending commitments, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East overshadowed the agenda.</p>

          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez responded to President Trump's attack after she suggested his decision to bomb Iran is grounds for impeachment. Trump lashed out at Ocasio-Cortez on Truth Social, calling her "stupid" and suggesting she take a cognitive test. Ocasio-Cortez responded with a humorous tweet, stating, ‚ÄúMr. President, don‚Äôt take your anger out on me - I‚Äôm just a silly girl,‚Äù and offering tips on emotional regulation. She corrected Trump about her connection to Queens, and the exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the two political figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's management of the Iran-Israel conflict has been marked by a running social-media commentary, characterized by bellicose and conciliatory statements. Trump has used Truth Social to announce key developments, including the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites and the ceasefire agreement. However, the rapidly changing situation and Trump's impulsive statements have created challenges, with experts predicting difficulties in maintaining a lasting ceasefire. Despite these challenges, Trump has continued to highlight what he portrays as a major victory, potentially positioning himself for a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
