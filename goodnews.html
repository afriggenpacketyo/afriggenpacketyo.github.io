          <p>Germany is experiencing a resurgence of its peace movement, marked by large protests against wars in Ukraine and Gaza, with over 10,000 gathering in Berlin demanding peace negotiations and an end to arms deliveries. Sahra Wagenknecht, a prominent politician, is leading the movement, emphasizing the need to address both the conflict in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Critics, however, accuse Wagenknecht of fueling hatred towards Israel, while others believe the movement lacks a unified goal compared to past peace movements. Despite fragmentation, resistance is growing, with major demonstrations planned for German Reunification Day, signaling a potential turning point against militarism. The movement is fueled by concerns over compulsory military service and a growing sentiment against war. The current pacifist movement may find traction with the general public. Optimism rests in the ability for the movement to mobilize. </p>

          <p>A North Carolina family is still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene a year ago, which destroyed over 74,000 homes and caused $60 billion in damages. The Keele family, who lost their home in the storm, is currently living in a donated camper and relying on the generosity of volunteers and nonprofit organizations. Despite the challenges, they express gratitude for the support they have received, including a new car, generators, and assistance with clearing out their damaged home. The family's resilience is symbolized by a wooden sign that survived the flood, reminding them to adjust to their current circumstances. The people of North Carolina are showing resilience in their recovery. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the EU to improve public finances, proposing an exchange scheme for young workers aged 18 to 30 for a two-year stay without the right to remain. Reeves has called for the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor in the potential economic impact of the scheme in its forecasts ahead of the budget, hoping to reduce the need for spending cuts or tax rises. The proposal has faced criticism from Conservatives and Reform UK, who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement. The OBR will send its first economic forecast to the treasury on Friday, which will include the gap the chancellor will need to make up in her 26 November Budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane in the Atlantic, with maximum sustained winds of 145 mph, but no immediate watches or warnings have been issued for the U.S. The storm is one of two systems swirling over the western Atlantic that could potentially bring some downstream impacts to parts of the Southeast U.S. coast, from Florida to North Carolina. Another storm system is brewing over the northeast Caribbean, which is expected to bring significant rainfall to portions of Cuba and the Bahamas. Forecasters are closely monitoring the system, which is expected to move across the central and northwestern Bahamas this weekend and approach the southeast U.S. coast early next week. The weather is continuing to be monitored. </p>

          <p>Emerald Fennell, director of a new film version of Wuthering Heights, aims to capture the "primal" feeling she experienced reading the book as a teenager, starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi. The director wants the film to convey the book's emotional intensity, describing it as primal, sexual, difficult, complicated, sexy, horrible, and devastating. Fennell suggested that some of her additions are things she thought she had remembered from reading the book as a teenager. The film is set to be released on Valentine's Day next year.
