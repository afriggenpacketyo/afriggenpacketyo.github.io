          <h2>GLP-1 Weight Loss Drugs Show Promise as Potential Treatment for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:32:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may effectively treat symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in studies and anecdotal reports have experienced benefits such as regulated menstrual cycles, weight loss, and reduced testosterone levels. While promising, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm these effects and address challenges like insurance coverage. The drugs appear to work by improving insulin sensitivity, which is often a core issue in PCOS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polls in the New York City mayoral race show that democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, holds a lead but is not guaranteed a victory. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is polling competitively, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams also running independently and Curtis Sliwa as the Republican nominee. President Trump has commented on the race, suggesting Cuomo has a strong chance against Mamdani. The presence of multiple high-profile independent candidates has created an unusually competitive and unpredictable general election in the heavily Democratic city.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has made significant changes to the leadership of its advanced technology research group, which focuses on innovations like quantum computing. Marco Pistoia, who led the group since 2020, has departed the bank, along with his deputy, Charles Lim. The bank has hired Rob Otter from State Street, who previously worked at JPMorgan's Onyx blockchain division, to take over the leadership role. This overhaul comes as major tech and financial firms race to harness the potential of quantum computing for complex problem-solving in finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed George Tidmarsh, a seasoned biotech executive and physician-scientist, to lead its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This key appointment comes during a period of significant change at the agency under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a potential stabilizing force, though his past writings suggest a critical stance on some recent FDA decisions, including controversial accelerated drug approvals. His leadership will be pivotal in shaping the FDA's regulatory approach to new treatments and drug advertising.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share from competitors by focusing on value promotions that appeal to budget-conscious diners. CEO Russell Weiner stated that industry headwinds are a tailwind for the company, as it successfully attracts customers across all income levels with deals like its $9.99 promotion. The strategy has led to a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, outperforming industry trends where many consumers are opting to eat at home. The company believes its focus on providing value on desired products gives it a competitive edge in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become a major public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike strategies that simply hold assets, the company plans to focus on generating yield through staking, a process that supports the Ethereum network's operations. Backed by several prominent crypto investment firms, The Ether Machine seeks to replicate the success of bitcoin-focused treasury companies like MicroStrategy, but for the second-largest cryptocurrency. The move reflects growing institutional interest in ether, particularly its potential as a productive, yield-bearing asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the airline is considering raising the bonus paid to staff for catching passengers with oversized baggage. Employees currently receive a small fee for identifying bags that exceed the airline's size limits, a practice O'Leary says is aimed at reducing boarding delays. The airline maintains that over 99% of passengers comply with the rules, but the fees and staff incentives are intended to address the small minority who do not. The comments were made as the budget airline reported a significant jump in quarterly profits, driven by higher fares and strong demand.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has called on YouTube to give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC and ITV. The recommendation is part of a plan to address the "serious threat" to public media, as younger audiences increasingly favor platforms like YouTube over traditional channels. Ofcom warned that the future of public service media is at risk if it cannot reach these viewers and suggested the government might need to legislate to ensure PSB content is easy to find. The regulator emphasized that PSBs must also improve at creating content that is engaging for online platforms.</p>
