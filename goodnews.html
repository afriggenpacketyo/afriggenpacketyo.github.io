          <p>California's tourism reached a record $157.3 billion in spending in 2024, but Governor Newsom anticipates a decline due to President Trump's tariffs, which could lead to a "Trump Slump." The state expects a 1% decrease in overall visitation and a 9.2% drop in international tourism, particularly from Canada, due to the tariffs. Local businesses in Los Angeles and desert towns that rely on tourism are already experiencing downturns. The governor's office has announced a marketing plan to invite Canadians back to California after recent declines in tourism figures.</p>

          <p>Hinge Health updated its prospectus, revealing a 50% increase in first-quarter revenue to $123.8 million, driven by accelerating growth. Despite filing to go public in March, the digital physical therapy startup has not yet announced a price range for its IPO. The company reported a net income of $17.1 million after taxes, a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss. Hinge is moving forward with its IPO plans despite economic uncertainty and market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policy, which has led other companies to delay their IPOs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The average U.S. gasoline price is actually $3.165 per gallon, according to AAA. Trump appears to be referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect retail prices paid by consumers. Analysts emphasize that RBOB excludes taxes, transportation costs, and other fees that make up the final price at the pump.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proceeding with the U.S. Department of Justice's defense of existing rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, a case initiated during the Biden administration. The DOJ filed a brief in Texas federal court urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from three Republican-led states on procedural grounds. Despite Trump's past statements, this action suggests that his administration is not prioritizing restrictions on mifepristone access. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health and human services secretary, stated that Trump has requested a study on the safety of abortion pills but has not made a decision on tightening restrictions.</p>
