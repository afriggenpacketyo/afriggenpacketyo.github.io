          <p>Jack Draper, the British men's number one in tennis, has shown significant progress on clay courts, reaching the final at the Madrid Open. This achievement marks a turnaround from previous struggles on clay, including a first-round exit at the French Open last year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that learning new languages physically alters the brain and enhances cognitive abilities, such as memory and problem-solving skills. Neuroscientists have found that neural pathways reshape as individuals learn a new language, improving communication between brain regions involved in attention, memory, and cognitive control. Studies show that learning languages at a young age is particularly advantageous due to the brain's greater adaptability during development. While it's debated whether multilingualism equates to higher intelligence, it undeniably expands verbal repertoire and offers diverse cultural experiences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a potentially universal antivenom using antibodies extracted from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who intentionally exposed himself to bites from multiple species of deadly snakes over many years. Friede's self-immunization process resulted in him becoming 'hyper-immune' to snake neurotoxins, enabling researchers to isolate antibodies effective against 19 of the world's deadliest snakes. The new antivenom has shown promise in mouse trials and could potentially be formulated for intramuscular delivery, making it more accessible in rural settings. The researchers plan to expand trials to treat dogs and develop another antivenom for viper bites.</p>

          <p>This article summarizes a podcast episode discussing the challenges of defining old age and the implications of classifying it as a disease. Dr. Kiran Rabheru, a geriatric psychiatrist, recounts his fight against the World Health Organization's attempt to designate 'old age' as a disease, arguing it would perpetuate ageism. The conversation explores the cultural conflation of aging and disease, the importance of challenging ageism, and the concept of 'healthspan,' focusing on extending the period of healthy living rather than simply prolonging lifespan. The podcast concludes with practical advice for promoting well-being at any age, including smiling, physical activity, and socialization.</p>
