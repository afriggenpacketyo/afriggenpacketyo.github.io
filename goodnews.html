          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 13:02:51 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling expands on a previous injunction and blocks a provision in Trump's tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting off payments for non-abortion services like STI testing and cancer screenings. The judge noted that restricting these services would likely lead to adverse public health consequences, including a rise in unintended pregnancies. Planned Parenthood argued that without this funding, nearly 200 of its clinics could be forced to close.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently experienced a slight decline, offering a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners compared to high-rate credit cards. With the average home equity level currently high, the article advises homeowners to carefully consider their options before borrowing against their property. It recommends comparing HELOCs and home equity loans, checking offers from current mortgage lenders, and precisely determining the necessary loan amount to avoid the risk of foreclosure.

          <p>Matty Healy, frontman of The 1975, is backing a new nationwide festival called The Seed Sounds Weekender to support small "seed" music venues across the UK. Healy warned that without these foundational venues, where artists like Amy Winehouse and The Smiths began, the talent pipeline for the music industry is at risk of drying up. The festival aims to highlight the cultural importance of pubs, bars, and other small stages that are facing severe economic challenges. Healy stated that the erosion of these spaces leads to a cultural economy where only the privileged can create art.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NPR, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg analyzed the Democratic Party's recent challenges and outlined a path for regaining public trust. Buttigieg warned that the party cannot simply revert to a pre-Trump status quo and must address the reasons why many Americans feel disconnected from the government. He also touched upon the widespread public skepticism surrounding official narratives, such as those concerning the Jeffrey Epstein files. The conversation focused on the need for Democrats to adapt their strategy to resonate with a changed political landscape.</p>

          <p>For individuals cutting back on red meat due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts recommend various alternative sources of iron. Registered dietitians suggest incorporating plant-based options such as lentils, beans, tofu, and spinach, which should be paired with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance absorption. Seafood like oysters, clams, and sardines are also excellent sources of this vital mineral. Additionally, fortified breads and cereals are a major source of dietary iron in the American diet, helping to prevent iron deficiency without relying on red meat consumption.</p>

After years of running marathons to process her trauma and raise money for charity, her cancer diagnoses and intensive treatments left her physically depleted.
