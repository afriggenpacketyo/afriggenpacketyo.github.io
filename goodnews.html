          <p>A theft charge against a man accused of taking flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has been officially withdrawn. Prosecutors dropped the case after a court heard that a security guard had granted the man permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of a conviction, as it could not be proven that the man acted with dishonest intent when he removed the flowers from the memorial site.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock value increased significantly following a U.S. court ruling on its antitrust case that was largely favorable to its subsidiary, Google. While the company was found to hold an illegal monopoly in the internet search market, it avoided the most severe penalties proposed by the Department of Justice, such as being forced to sell its Chrome browser. The ruling allows Google to continue making payments to companies like Apple to be the default search engine, removing a major source of uncertainty for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The iconic fashion brand Topshop is scheduled to return to the UK High Street in 2026, five years after its physical stores closed following the collapse of its parent company. The brand will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores, with its menswear counterpart, Topman, in six locations. After being acquired by online retailer Asos, Topshop's majority stake was sold to a Danish retail group, which is now orchestrating its comeback. This nationwide partnership is seen as a strategic move to reintroduce the brand to in-person shoppers and attract new customers to John Lewis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the changing depiction of children in art, from medieval religious icons to modern, spontaneous photography. Initially, children in art were often limited to portrayals of Jesus or angels, or as miniature adults in noble portraits designed for political purposes like marriage alliances. The Renaissance and Baroque periods saw a shift towards individual, often idealized, portraits among the wealthy bourgeoisie. Over centuries, the artistic lens expanded to include peasant children and eventually, with the advent of photography, captured the spontaneous and unburdened moments of modern childhood.</p>

This optimistic outlook is based on developers' positive guidance, expectations of margin recovery, and the potential start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate cut cycle.
