          <p>Nearly a third of the 260 miners trapped underground following an accident at a Sibanye-Stillwater gold mine in South Africa have been safely brought to the surface. The miners were stuck after the hoist system used to access a shaft at the Kloof gold mine was damaged. While there were no fatalities or injuries, the National Union of Mineworkers emphasized concerns about the miners' well-being after being without food and water for 24 hours. This incident underscores the risks associated with deep-level mining in South Africa, where mining accidents are not uncommon.</p>

          <p>Scientists have captured unprecedented high-definition images of the USS F-1, a World War I-era submarine that sank off the coast of San Diego in 1917, killing 19 crew members. The images, taken by a team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution using advanced deep-sea imaging technology, reveal the submarine's final resting place over 1,300 feet below the ocean's surface. The USS F-1 collided with its sister ship, USS F-3, during exercises on the ocean's surface off San Diego eight days before Christmas in 1917. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed near the same area in 1950, and held a remembrance ceremony for the lost crew members.</p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who was imprisoned in Iran three years ago before going on a hunger strike. This victory is a win for artistic expression and freedom of speech, and also marks the sixth consecutive Palme d'Or win for the indie distributor Neon. The closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday, but the event proceeded as planned.</p>
