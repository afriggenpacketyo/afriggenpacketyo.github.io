          <p>The Buss family is reportedly selling a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, in a deal valued at $10 billion, which would make the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise in the world. Jeanie Buss will remain as governor, representing the team in league matters, continuing her role since her father Jerry's death in 2013. Walter also owns the Professional Women's Hockey League, the Los Angeles Sparks, and has interests in Chelsea and the Cadillac Formula 1 racing team, expanding his sports portfolio. The sale marks a significant moment for the Lakers, who have been under the Buss family's ownership since 1979 and have won 11 NBA titles during that time. The optimism score reflects the excitement around the change in ownership and potential positive impact on the team's future. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers announced plans to assist immigrant communities impacted in Los Angeles, marking their first public comment since federal immigration agents began raids throughout the Southland. This announcement comes after the Dodgers initially declined to comment on the raids, leading to increased calls on social media for the team to address the situation. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that the team could be a positive distraction for those affected, while utilityman Kik√© Hern√°ndez spoke out against the treatment of the community. The Dodgers' plans follow similar statements from soccer clubs LAFC and Angel City FC, acknowledging the fear and uncertainty in the community.

          <p>As tariffs rise, businesses are increasingly employing "tariff engineering" to lower duty payments by altering product materials or dimensions to fit different harmonized system codes. This legal practice involves strategic design choices to create products subject to lower tariff rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements or switching synthetic materials for cotton. Winnebago Industries plans to use tariff mitigation strategies, while Columbia Sportswear adds zippered pockets to women's shirts for tariff exemptions.

Hashimoto believes that while his company's acquisition of U.S. Steel should help the U.S. economy, trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after Trump reversed his initial opposition. The company has concluded a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, pledging to invest around $11 billion by 2028 in U.S. Steel.
