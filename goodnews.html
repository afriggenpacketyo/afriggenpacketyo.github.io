          <p>Alphabet announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance in its search and cloud divisions. The company's overall revenue grew 14% year-over-year, and its Google Cloud business saw a 31% increase. Despite the positive results, Alphabet also raised its projected capital expenditures for 2025 by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion, citing high demand for its AI and cloud services. This increased spending signals a deeper investment in the competitive artificial intelligence landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, yet its shares fell in after-hours trading. The company saw revenue increase by nearly 8% year-over-year, with its software and hybrid cloud segments showing significant growth. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that geopolitical tensions and constrained U.S. federal spending were causing some clients to be cautious, while the company's finance chief mentioned delays in discretionary projects. Despite the market's reaction, IBM reaffirmed its full-year guidance for revenue growth and free cash flow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Word "OK" Traces Its Origins to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>

          <p>The ubiquitous word "OK" is an American invention that began as a joke in the 1830s before being popularized by a presidential campaign. Linguists trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as a playful abbreviation for "oll korrect," a deliberate misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread use during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" aligned perfectly with the "O.K." abbreviation. Now considered one of the most widely understood words globally, its journey highlights how slang can evolve into a universal term.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on profits from home sales. Currently, sellers can face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The idea, recently introduced in a House bill by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, is intended to boost the housing market by encouraging homeowners, particularly seniors, to sell without facing a large tax penalty. While the proposal could benefit many homeowners in high-value areas, experts note it could be costly and may face challenges in gaining broad congressional support. (not investment advice)</p>

This coalition, including venues like Las Perlas and La Cita, aims to create a safe and culturally rich experience to attract locals and support struggling businesses. The initiative was inspired by the need to better reflect the area's large Latino population and create a supportive economic cycle for both large and small venues.

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined Democrats in introducing a bill to shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The "CANADA Act" would specifically exempt small businesses from the 25% duty on goods and 10% tariff on energy that Trump has threatened. The sponsors argue that the tariffs harm small businesses that rely on cross-border trade, drive up costs for consumers, and damage the long-standing economic relationship with Canada. This legislative effort represents a bipartisan pushback against the administration's trade policies toward a key U.S. ally.</p>

          <p>In a pair of rulings, federal judges have blocked immigration authorities from immediately detaining Kilmar Abrego Garcia upon his release from criminal custody in a human smuggling case. A Tennessee judge ordered his release pending trial, while a Maryland judge barred ICE from taking him into custody without 72 hours' notice. The Maryland judge's order aims to protect Abrego Garcia's due process rights after he was unlawfully deported to El Salvador earlier despite a court order protecting him. The rulings represent a significant legal rebuke of the government's handling of his case and safeguard him from being "spirited away."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding where to deposit $10,000, savers must weigh the guaranteed return of a Certificate of Deposit (CD) against the flexibility of a high-yield savings account. A 6-month CD at a top rate of 4.45% would earn approximately $220, a return that is locked in. In contrast, a high-yield savings account with a current rate of 4.30% would earn about $213 over six months, but this rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Fed cuts rates. For savers who can afford to lock away their funds, the CD offers a slightly higher and more secure return in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new reboot, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," is praised as a refreshingly mature and restrained superhero movie that embraces a retro, 1950s sci-fi aesthetic. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film skips the origin story and presents the heroes as settled adults, focusing on character and a solemn tone rather than frantic action. The review highlights the strong, emotionally credible performances from the cast, including Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby, and the film's sleek, vintage visual style. By valorizing the team's "lameness" instead of trying to make them cool, the movie successfully restores a sense of dignity to the classic characters.</p>
