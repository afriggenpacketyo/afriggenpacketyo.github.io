          <p>President Trump held a rally in Iowa to celebrate the congressional passage of his administration's major tax and spending bill, which he called a great birthday present for America. He highlighted the legislation's tax cuts, border security funding, and spending reductions as key victories. During the event, Trump also previewed plans for the nation's 250th anniversary celebration, which will include a "Great American State Fair" starting in Iowa and a UFC fight on the White House lawn. He also reiterated the success of recent military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. made a spectacular play during a game against the Seattle Mariners, avoiding a tag at home plate with an incredible slide. After being sent from second on a base hit, the throw beat him to the plate, but he slid wide and contorted his body to touch home with his hand. The run was crucial in the Royals' eventual victory. The play highlighted the athleticism of Witt Jr., who also extended his road-game hitting streak to a new franchise record of 23 games.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are closely tracking 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to have entered our solar system. The comet, estimated to be about 12.4 miles wide, poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach in October at a distance of about 240 million kilometers. While its exact origin is unknown, it is believed to have come from the direction of the Milky Way's center. The discovery highlights advancements in telescope technology, and scientists anticipate finding more such objects with new systems like the Vera Rubin Observatory.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease outlines five types of foods he avoids giving his own children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes and deep-fried foods cooked in industrial oils. The article advocates for whole-food alternatives and establishing healthy habits early in life.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on Deciding Whether to Hire Professional Movers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides financial guidance on whether the high cost of hiring professional movers is a worthwhile expense. Experts suggest considering four key questions: the value of items that would be expensive to replace, the monetary value of the time saved by outsourcing, the potential for reduced stress and peace of mind, and whether the cost would jeopardize long-term financial goals. The advice emphasizes calculating a personal hourly rate to weigh the trade-offs and suggests that protecting one's productivity and mental well-being can make the expense a sound investment.

          <h2>Book Reviews Champion a Philosophy of Valuing Women's Bodies for Function over Appearance</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This cultural commentary reviews two new books that advocate for a shift in how women perceive their physical selves, emphasizing functionality and strength over purely aesthetic appeal. One book explores how weight lifting can help women reject restrictive diet culture and see their bodies as capable working objects. The other examines the work of fashion designer Claire McCardell, who created practical, comfortable clothing for women as "doers." Together, these works propose a refreshing philosophy that values what bodies can do, rather than just how they look, challenging constrictive beauty standards.</p>

          <p>In response to the ongoing paralysis of the World Trade Organization's dispute resolution system, the EU and Germany have proposed leading an initiative to form a new global trade body. The idea, floated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to create an alliance of like-minded nations committed to liberalized, rules-based trade. This new organization could initially partner with the CPTPP trade bloc and would exclude countries like the U.S. and China, which are seen as undermining the current system through protectionism and market distortions, respectively.

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed a collection of unusually large, 2,000-year-old shoes at the Magna Roman Fort, part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site in northern England. Eight of the discovered shoes are size 15 (U.S.) or larger, a proportion significantly higher than at other Roman sites. The discovery has prompted researchers to investigate which Roman regiments were stationed there and why so many large-footed individuals might have been present. The leather artifacts were well-preserved in the low-oxygen soil of a defensive ditch, which the Romans often used as a trash dump.</p>

          <p>A major blackout left large areas of the Czech Republic, including parts of the capital, Prague, without electricity on Friday. The national grid operator, CEPS, confirmed the widespread outage was caused by a fallen power line.

Power was restored to the majority of affected areas relatively quickly, and police stated there was no indication of a cyber or terror attack.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own" from a modern, intersectional feminist perspective. The author describes initially avoiding the book, viewing it as a symbol of privileged white feminism, but later finding its core arguments about the suppression of women's voices to be powerful and resonant. The article connects Woolf's ideas on the need for financial and personal space to create art with contemporary issues like the gender pay gap and the undervaluing of women's stories. It also considers the book's limitations while celebrating its foundational insights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical commentary explores how the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in creating a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. Initially, the colonies were disparate and competitive, and Washington himself viewed the troops as a disorderly mix. However, the shared experience of hardship and sacrifice during the war forged a common bond and a national spirit. The army established new traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday and adopting a national flag, laying the groundwork for a national identity that transcended colonial distinctions.</p>
