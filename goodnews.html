          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law to bolster its private economy, set to take effect on May 20. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely monitoring the implementation of this law to assess its effectiveness, particularly in enabling firms to challenge local governments in court and protecting them from arbitrary fines. The law is intended to curb administrative powers and prevent intervention in economic disputes, with hopes that courts will be more willing to accept and fairly adjudicate cases against local governments. The 78-article law is hailed as evidence of Beijing's commitment to revitalizing the non-state economy.</p>
