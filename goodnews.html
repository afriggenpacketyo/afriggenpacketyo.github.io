          <p>NASA has unveiled its 2025 astronaut class, which notably includes more women than men for the first time. The ten candidates, selected from over 8,000 applicants, bring diverse expertise, including pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. They will now undergo a two-year training program for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars. The selection comes during a period of uncertainty for NASA, with budget cuts and the impending retirement of the ISS, but officials remain optimistic about winning the new space race against China.</p>

          <p>A preliminary report from the National Weather Service has confirmed that a tornado in southeast Utah on September 13 reached EF-2 strength, with wind speeds of 120 mph. The powerful twister was one of two that touched down near Montezuma Creek, lasting for 47 minutes and destroying three homes in the area. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, though some animals went missing. Tornadoes are a rare occurrence in Utah, and this event was unusually strong for the region, which has only recorded a few weak twisters in its history.</p>

          <p>India is making a significant push to establish a domestic semiconductor industry with approved investments totaling over $18.2 billion. The "Semiconductor Mission" aims to build a complete supply chain, from chip design to fabrication and packaging, reducing reliance on imports and capturing a share of the market shifting from China. While the country possesses a large pool of engineering talent, it faces challenges as a late entrant in a highly competitive field. Experts note that success will require developing a deep, long-term ecosystem that addresses hundreds of factors, including infrastructure and robust intellectual property laws.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, has called for the government to offer discounted visas to American cancer scientists whose research has been affected by Trump administration budget cuts. In a speech at his party's conference, Davey argued that the UK should seize the opportunity to lead in cancer research by welcoming scientists impacted by what he termed the U.S. government's "anti-science agenda." The proposal follows significant cuts to biomedical research grants in the U.S., which prompted concerns from scientific organizations about the future of life-saving breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches new highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified several companies that he believes are still trading at a relatively inexpensive price compared to their growth potential. His list spans multiple sectors, including telecommunications with T-Mobile, consumer travel with Royal Caribbean, and retail with Dollar Tree. In the financial sector, he highlighted names like Citigroup and American Express, while also pointing to opportunities in healthcare with Incyte and technology with Dell. Cramer suggests that even in a strong market, careful analysis can uncover stocks that offer faster-than-average growth at a lower-than-average price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, with its epicenter located near Berkeley. The quake, which occurred just before 3 a.m., was widely felt across the region, waking many residents and causing shaking strong enough to knock items off shelves. Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) services were temporarily slowed for track inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. Officials reported no major damage or injuries, but the event served as a reminder of the seismic risks inherent to the region and the importance of preparedness.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece frames the controversy surrounding Jimmy Kimmel's temporary suspension as a critical test for free speech and self-censorship in the face of authoritarian pressure. The author argues that humor is a powerful tool for draining away fear and building camaraderie, which is why autocratic regimes historically target comedians. The article posits that Kimmel's return to the airwaves is a significant moment, urging him not to temper his comedy or pull punches when satirizing those in power. Making fun of the powerful, the author concludes, is not just entertainment but a form of patriotic duty in a healthy democracy.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril is preparing for the first flight of its YFQ-44A Fury drone, a candidate for the U.S. Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program. The company has prioritized developing semi-autonomous capabilities from the outset, with the goal of having the drone perform its first takeoff and landing with the push of a button rather than remote piloting. This software-first approach is intended to accelerate the overall development timeline for fielding an operational uncrewed wingman. Several Fury drones are currently undergoing ground tests, with the first flight described by an Air Force official as "imminent."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, reversing its decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, which drew threats of regulatory action from the Trump-appointed FCC chairman. The move to pull the show sparked a nationwide debate on free speech, with critics, Hollywood figures, and civil liberties advocates condemning it as censorship. In its statement, Disney explained the initial suspension was due to the comments being "ill-timed and thus insensitive" but that conversations with Kimmel led to the decision to reinstate the program.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their condition does not improve after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to arrange further tests, seek second opinions, or refer to a specialist to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses. Health officials hope this "three strikes and rethink" approach will become standard practice and improve patient safety.</p>

The next plan will be crucial for laying the groundwork for this long-term ambition. Experts suggest that given the current turbulent environment, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets of the past. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Northern California credit an anonymous tip with preventing a potential school shooting at Menlo-Atherton High School. A student utilized the "Say Something" tip line, created by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, to report concerning online posts from a former student. This led to a swift police response, a campus lockdown, and the detainment of the individual before any violence could occur. According to the organization, this is the 19th credible planned school attack that the reporting system has helped to thwart since its launch in 2018.</p>
