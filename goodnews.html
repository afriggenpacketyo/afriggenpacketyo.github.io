        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Private schools have lost a High Court challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. Lawyers representing families and schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The court ruled that Parliament made the policy after full debate and as a manifesto commitment, and the government is entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. The government estimates the policy will generate ¬£1.8 billion annually by 2029/30, which will be used to improve standards in the state sector.</p>

          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called on Niger's junta government to resolve disputes with Chinese energy companies through dialogue. This follows Niger's expulsion of Chinese oil executives and the revocation of a Chinese-owned hotel's license due to salary disparities and discriminatory practices. Wang urged the junta to ensure the safety and rights of Chinese companies and citizens in Niger, and to create favorable conditions for long-term cooperation. The Agadem oilfield and oil pipeline, developed by CNPC, are key projects in the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Copenhagen is implementing innovative solutions to adapt to a warmer world and increased rainfall, including rain tunnels and "sponge parks." Following a devastating storm in 2011, the city launched a $1.3 billion "Cloudburst Management Plan" to mitigate flooding. The Kalvebod Brygge Cloudburst Tunnel, a nearly mile-long underground tunnel, can hold 10,000 cubic meters of water, while parks like Enghaveparken have been redesigned to serve as reservoirs during heavy rain events. The city's long-term climate adaptation planning has garnered international attention, with Copenhagen consulting with cities worldwide on similar infrastructure projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully taking apart buildings to salvage reusable materials, is gaining momentum as a climate solution. This approach keeps waste out of landfills and reduces the carbon footprint associated with new construction. While deconstruction and reuse industries have emerged in cities like Portland and Boulder, challenges remain in scaling the practice, including the need for local infrastructure to process and distribute salvaged materials and the higher costs compared to traditional demolition. Some local governments are implementing policies to incentivize or require deconstruction, with Boulder, Colorado, reporting that over 83% of construction waste has been diverted from landfills since adopting a deconstruction ordinance in 2020.</p>

          <p>During protests against immigration detentions in Los Angeles, demonstrators have been carrying a variety of flags, including those of Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador, sparking debate about their significance. Protesters explain that the flags represent their heritage, family ties, and solidarity with immigrant communities. Some, like Christopher Kim, carry the flag of their immigrant parents' homeland as a tribute, while others, like Ariel Miller, wave flags for friends who cannot attend the protests. Despite criticism, many view the flags as symbols of diversity and a reminder of the immigrant roots of the community.</p>

The repayments go into a pool to support future students, and employers may help pay off the loans. The program is designed to address workforce shortages in critical industries. San Diego County will launch a program targeting behavioral health majors, with loans forgiven for graduates working in the field for five years or more. Several states are exploring similar initiatives, but challenges remain, including high startup costs and concerns about unintended consequences. (not investment advice)</p>
