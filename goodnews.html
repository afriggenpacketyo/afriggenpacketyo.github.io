        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent Zillow report, the color of a room's paint can significantly impact a home's sale price, potentially boosting it by almost $2,600. Olive green is currently the most desirable kitchen color, with homebuyers willing to pay up to $1,600 more for kitchens featuring cabinets in this shade. Classic navy walls are preferred for bedrooms, adding an estimated $1,815 to the home's value, while dark gray living rooms are also favored. Conversely, bright and playful colors like lemon yellow in the kitchen or scarlet red in the bedroom can decrease a home's sale price. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are resorting to "tariff engineering," which involves altering a product's materials, dimensions, or composition to qualify for a different, lower-tariffed "harmonized system code." This legal practice allows companies to strategically redesign products to reduce duty liability, as exemplified by a lapel pin with cubic zirconia added to reclassify it as jewelry, thus avoiding a 14% tariff. Columbia Sportswear adds small zippered pockets to women's shirts for tariff exemptions, while Converse adds fuzzy-felt to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. Winnebago Industries, a motorhome manufacturer, is planning to implement tariff engineering and deferrals as part of its mitigation strategies.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that U.S. Steel is of increasing strategic importance, as U.S. tariffs on steel products are likely to remain. Hashimoto believes Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but trade levies will not revive its manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary after President Trump reversed his initial opposition. The company has pledged to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh. </p>

Read argued she was framed by the police for murder, while the prosecution alleged she ran over O'Keefe and left him to die in a snowbank.

          <p>The Los Angeles Zoo has successfully hatched 10 condor chicks, which will be eligible for release into the wild to help restore California's depleted condor population. The chicks will contribute to increasing the genetic diversity of the wild condor population. Four of the chicks are being raised using a double-brooding method, where two chicks are raised simultaneously by surrogate condors, a technique pioneered by the L.A. Zoo. The California Condor Recovery Program has increased the condor population from 22 to 561, with 344 living in the wild, though the species remains critically endangered due to lead poisonings and other toxins.</p>

          <h2>Michigan Wildlife Experts Remove Lid Stuck Around Bear's Neck After Two Years</h2>

          <p>Wildlife experts in Michigan successfully trapped a black bear and removed a large lid that had been stuck around its neck for two years. The bear was first spotted on a trail camera as a cub in 2023, and the Department of Natural Resources had been searching for it since. Despite the neck being scarred and missing hair, the bear was in better condition than expected, and it is unknown how the lid got stuck or how the bear survived the winters with it. The 110-lb bear was anesthetized, the lid was cut off, and it was released back into the wild.</p>

          <h2>FDA Approves Lenacapavir as Twice-Yearly HIV Prevention Injection</h2>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention, based on clinical trials showing a 99.9% efficacy rate. Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a "milestone moment" in the fight against HIV, with the potential to prevent HIV on an unprecedented scale. While this approval meets an existing need, concerns remain about the Trump administration's decisions to cut funding for HIV vaccine research. Experts emphasize the ongoing need for a vaccine, warning that the funding cuts could set back research efforts by a decade.</p>

          <p>The Office for Students (OfS) is advising students to be prepared to encounter shocking and offensive views at university, emphasizing that exposure to diverse perspectives is part of the educational process. The OfS has released guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech, following a fine issued to the University of Sussex for its policy on trans equality. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to protect freedom of speech and academic freedom, covering aspects from protests to teaching. The OfS director for free speech stated that students should be able to express any view, as long as it does not violate the law.</p>

          <h2>U.S. to Combat Screwworms with $8.5M Fly Facility in Texas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 19:55:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government is implementing a five-prong policy to combat the spread of New World screwworms, including the construction of an $8.5 million insect dispersal facility in Texas. The facility will breed millions of sterile screwworm flies to be released into the wild, preventing fertile flies from laying eggs in wounds. The move follows concerns about the screwworm's migration further north through the Americas, which prompted the USDA to suspend live cattle, horse, and bison imports from Mexico. The facility will be built at Moore Air Base and could produce up to 300 million sterile flies per week.</p>
