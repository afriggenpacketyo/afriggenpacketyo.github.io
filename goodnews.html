        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming New Jersey gubernatorial primary is drawing significant attention as experts suggest it could serve as an early indicator of national sentiment ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Political scientists note that the race may reflect voter attitudes toward President Donald Trump and the strength of his endorsement for Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli. Key issues in the election include immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, housing costs, and general affordability, all of which resonate with voters nationwide. The Democratic primary features a crowded field of candidates, including U.S. Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, as well as Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, each vying to succeed term-limited Governor Phil Murphy.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a 'planned partnership' between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, ensuring that U.S. Steel will remain in America with its headquarters in Pittsburgh. According to Trump, this partnership is projected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. While the details of the agreement remain unclear, U.S. Steel praised Trump's leadership, stating that the company will grow bigger and stronger through the partnership with Nippon Steel. Shares of U.S. Steel experienced a significant jump following the announcement, though the United Steelworkers union had no immediate comment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by failing to adequately protect Jewish students, marking the latest action in a monthslong targeting of the institution. The accusation stems from alleged breaches of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination by recipients of federal funds. This action follows previous measures, including the suspension of over $400 million in research funding to Columbia, and reflects the administration's approach to universities it believes are not adequately addressing antisemitism. Columbia has responded by announcing changes to campus protest and security policies, as well as increased oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed four executive orders designed to expedite the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors, in the United States. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months, while another encourages the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands. The administration also aims to quadruple the nation‚Äôs nuclear power capacity by 2050, citing a 'national energy emergency' and the need for increased electricity, especially for data centers supporting artificial intelligence. These actions have garnered bipartisan support due to nuclear power's lack of planet-warming emissions and its potential to strengthen U.S. energy security.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has overturned President Trump‚Äôs executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed an attorney who investigated him. The order had suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings, citing activities that 'undermine justice.' The court ruled that the order violated the constitution‚Äôs first and fifth amendments, noting the executive order targeted Jenner & Block because of the causes Jenner champions, the clients Jenner represents, and a lawyer Jenner once employed. This decision mirrors a similar ruling against an executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to prevent international students from attending Harvard University, granting a restraining order requested by the university. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of a 'campaign of retribution' for the university's exercise of its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit followed the Department of Homeland Security's revocation of Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, which would have halted the university's ability to enroll international students. Harvard argued that the action would cause 'immediate and irreparable injury' and imperil the futures of thousands of students.</p>

The condition, which is often underdiagnosed, becomes more prevalent with age, and while rare, it can be treated with surgery or physical therapy. Joel's statement indicated that his condition had been 'exacerbated by recent concert performances,' and he is currently undergoing physical therapy.</p>
