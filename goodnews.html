          <p>McCormick CEO Brendan Foley stated the company is actively assessing and mitigating the impact of new tariffs on its agricultural supply chain. Although 90% of its products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, many key ingredients like black pepper are sourced internationally from various global markets. Foley noted that consumer demand for flavor remains strong despite economic pressures, and the company's stock rose over 5% following a positive earnings report. The company feels its portfolio is well-positioned for a health-conscious market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled by a beach umbrella pole. The incident occurred when a strong gust of wind dislodged the umbrella from her stand, causing her to fall and land on the pole, which pierced her armpit. Remarkably, the pole missed all major arteries, nerves, and tendons by a narrow margin. The lifeguard, identified only as Alex, remained calm throughout the ordeal and expressed gratitude to her fellow lifeguards and paramedics.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of an exoplanet, a significant milestone since its 2021 launch. The planet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young star approximately 50 times farther than Earth is from the sun. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to block the star's glare and reveal the faint planet. While a small possibility of it being a background galaxy exists, researchers state the evidence strongly indicates it is a newly discovered planet.</p>

Adams, who is now running as an independent, framed the election as a choice between his practical progress and Mamdani's socialist ideals.

          <p>The S&P 500 is nearing a record high, showing a remarkable recovery from a sharp downturn in April that followed new tariff announcements. The market has rallied 23% since its low on April 8, driven largely by strong performance in the technology sector, particularly from AI-related companies like Nvidia. Analysts attribute the rebound to easing concerns over trade disputes, optimism about tech stock earnings, and investor anticipation of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve later this year. The market's resilience suggests confidence despite ongoing geopolitical and economic risks. (not investment advice)</p>

In a unanimous ruling, the court sided with Teran, stating the documents contained nothing a member of the public couldn't otherwise access.
