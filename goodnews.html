          <p>UK strawberry growers are experiencing a "stonking start" to the 2025 season, with warmer days and cooler nights resulting in exceptionally sweet fruit. Marion Regan of Hugh Lowe Farms notes the strawberries are a good size and particularly sweet, attributing this to the ideal weather conditions. While drought concerns exist, farmers have irrigation systems in place. This contrasts sharply with 2024 when a wet winter delayed ripening, underscoring the impact of climate change on agriculture, making the current season a welcome change for both growers and consumers.</p>

          <p>In an interview, the publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, discusses the importance of a free press for democracy and the threats it faces.

          <p>Boeing's new 777X will not feature engine chevrons, the shark-tooth-like structures on some jet engines designed to reduce noise. While chevrons disrupt exhaust to minimize sound, they also reduce engine thrust. The 777X utilizes General Electric's GE9X engines, incorporating new nozzle designs and ceramic matrix composites for heat resistance, resulting in a more compact exhaust stream and less friction. The GE9X also features a honeycomb architecture for acoustic disruption, making the 777X quieter and more fuel-efficient without sacrificing power.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study reveals a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months due to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant people and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians have also observed that young children requiring hospitalization often need lower levels of care. The study indicates that these preventative measures are effective in protecting young babies from severe illness.</p>
