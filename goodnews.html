          <p>The Ukrainian government has permitted men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country, a decision President Zelenskyy believes will encourage them to remain in Ukraine long-term without harming defense capabilities. The policy has sparked a debate, with some viewing it as a positive step towards freedom and others seeing it as unfair to active military personnel. While border officials have not noted a significant surge in departures, young men are using the opportunity for short-term travel, work, and family visits, with varied intentions of returning.</p>

          <p>A woman in Pasco County, Florida, successfully rescued her four-month-old puppy after an alligator dragged it into a creek behind her home. Danie Wright jumped into the water and wrestled the small dog from the alligator's jaws, sustaining an injury to her own arm in the process. She managed to free her arm by punching and elbowing the alligator until it loosened its grip. A trapper was later called to capture the animal, and Wright is now warning others to be vigilant and aware of their surroundings near water.</p>

This act of giving back through music became a deeply powerful moment that shaped her future.

She uses weaving to create pieces that metaphorically represent medical procedures and the emotional turmoil of health crises, such as the chaos of the pandemic. For Ruggiero, who was a neuroscience researcher before becoming a nurse, art serves as a therapeutic outlet and a way to cope with the stress of her profession. She now also teaches weaving, sharing her creative coping mechanism with others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are outlining the implications for retirees considering reverse mortgages. Unlike traditional mortgages that quickly reflect Fed changes, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a wider range of factors, meaning rates may not drop as uniformly. The article advises that lower rates can increase a homeowner's borrowing capacity, but retirees should carefully compare fixed-rate and adjustable-rate options and shop around with multiple lenders. Choosing the right product depends on an individual's preference for rate predictability versus the potential to benefit from further rate declines. (not investment advice)</p>
