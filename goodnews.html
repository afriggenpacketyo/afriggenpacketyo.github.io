          <p>Wendy Cutler, with three decades of experience in shaping US trade policy, provides insights into the complex US-China trade relationship following recent landmark talks and tariff reductions. She notes that while the tariff truce exceeded expectations, the 90-day window for securing a tariff-free deal is extremely short, anticipating potential ups and downs in bilateral relations. Progress is being made on fentanyl concerns, but addressing US concerns regarding excess capacity, subsidies, and transshipments will pose significant challenges. Cutler emphasizes the need for both sides to find common ground, particularly within the limited timeframe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, avoid shaming, and view misbehavior as stress signals rather than defiance. The framework encourages parents to do their own internal work to become less reactive and more compassionate, leading with calm authority while welcoming even the biggest emotions.</p>

Containment efforts focused on clearing lines with bulldozers and hand-digging lines in rugged terrain.
