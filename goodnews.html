          <p>Zimbabwe has finalized a $455 million, 15-year concession agreement with India's Jindal Steel for the refurbishment of its 920-megawatt Hwange coal-fired power plant. The project, expected to take four years, aims to upgrade six aging units currently operating at a third of their capacity. This deal is crucial for the Southern African nation, which currently meets only half of its 2,000 MW electricity demand and faces frequent, extended power cuts. Jindal Africa will recover its investment through revenue from electricity sales generated by the plant.</p>

Her remarks quickly drew criticism on both English and Chinese social media platforms for cultural insensitivity. Townsend stated she understood her privilege as an athlete traveling globally and vowed to "be better." This incident underscores the importance of cultural awareness in public commentary.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu experienced a nearly 16% surge in its Hong Kong shares, reaching a two-year high, driven by positive developments in its artificial intelligence business. The company's aggressive focus on AI-related chip and cloud-computing ventures, supporting its Ernie Bot and large language models, led to a ratings upgrade. Baidu's strategy to use internally designed chips aims to reduce reliance on Nvidia and offset struggles in its online advertising sector. Recent partnerships and a significant offshore bond offering further bolster its position in China's competitive AI space.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK is framed as a crucial opportunity to deepen trade and business ties, leveraging "tiara diplomacy" for economic gain. The visit is expected to yield substantial deals, with companies like Nvidia, OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft announcing multi-billion-pound AI investments in the UK. Energy agreements, including nuclear power cooperation, are also anticipated, alongside a doubling of Blackstone's UK investment. This bonanza of deals reflects the UK's desire for a confidence boost amidst economic stagnation and its unique relationship with the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively pivoting its trade strategy away from the United States, with major trading hubs like Yiwu increasingly focusing on markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. This shift is a direct consequence of ongoing U.S. tariffs and the lingering impact of the trade war, which has seen China's exports to the U.S. decline significantly. While new markets offer stability, they often come with lower margins, forcing Chinese suppliers to adapt. The continued high U.S. tariffs and new cargo fees are making alternative markets a safer bet for Chinese businesses.</p>

          <p>China's offshore yuan has strengthened significantly against the U.S. dollar, surpassing 7.1 per dollar for the first time in nearly a year, driven by anticipation of a U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The expected easing by the Fed is projected to further depreciate the U.S. dollar, contributing to the yuan's greater stability and strength. This currency movement marks another milestone in China's gradual monetary policy adjustments. Economists predict the Fed's easing will provide momentum for the dollar's depreciation trend, benefiting the yuan.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a modest 0.1% year-on-year in August, a softer decline than the 1.9% expected by economists, marking the fourth consecutive month of negative growth. This improved performance was largely attributed to a 1.7% rebound in shipments to Asia, its largest trading region, and a sharp 7.7% jump to Western Europe. However, exports to the U.S. saw a steeper 13.8% fall, impacted by tariffs and a slowdown from earlier front-loading. Despite the overall contraction, the figures suggest some resilience in Japan's export sector.</p>
