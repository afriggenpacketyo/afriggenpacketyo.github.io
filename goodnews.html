          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly resumed processing student debt forgiveness for some borrowers enrolled in the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, according to a trade group and consumer advocates. This relief, which was paused in July, grants debt cancellation to borrowers who have made payments for 20 to 25 years. The resumption comes amid legal challenges and scrutiny over the administration's handling of student loan programs, though advocates note that large backlogs for other forgiveness programs, like Public Service Loan Forgiveness, still remain.</p>

The move is expected to integrate SciTec's software capabilities, including missile warning and tracking systems, into Firefly's launch and space services. The announcement led to a 7% rise in Firefly's stock, signaling investor confidence despite a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that had previously caused shares to drop.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative, has been chosen as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. A staunch supporter of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's vision, her leadership immediately faces challenges, including managing inflation and navigating complex diplomatic relations. Her ultra-conservative stances, such as visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, are already straining her party's long-standing coalition with the centrist Komeito party, creating immediate political instability.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she is "not afraid" despite facing routine protests and death threats following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. She emphasized her commitment to not letting emotions guide her decisions, a principle she applies to both her personal life and her originalist judicial philosophy. Barrett also discussed her new book, which aims to demystify the Court's work and correct public misconceptions that its decisions are driven by politics rather than legal interpretation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first rate cut of 2025, mortgage rates have declined, providing significant savings for homebuyers. For a $550,000 mortgage, the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.34% results in a monthly principal and interest payment of $3,418.70, over $200 less than at the start of the year. This decrease in borrowing costs is making homeownership more accessible for those previously priced out of the market and also presents a potential opportunity for existing homeowners to refinance their loans.

          <p>One year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, Nike has implemented significant price increases across its core product lines, with footwear prices rising 17% and apparel 14%. This strategy is part of an effort to restore the brand's pricing power and improve margins, which have been compressed by external factors like tariffs on goods from Asia. While the company posted surprise sales growth recently, it also forecast a weak holiday season, indicating a potentially difficult path to full recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a widespread push from major corporations for employees to return to the office, work-from-home rates have remained stable since early 2023. Stanford research suggests a growing "compliance gap," where employees engage in passive resistance, such as "coffee badging"—showing up for just a few hours—or simply not adhering to the mandated number of in-office days. This trend persists as middle managers are often reluctant to enforce strict attendance rules, and workers continue to prioritize the flexibility they gained during the pandemic.</p>
