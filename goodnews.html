          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has asserted that the War Powers Act, a law from the Nixon era intended to limit presidential war-making authority, is unconstitutional, citing arguments from constitutional scholars. Johnson stated that President Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear targets were within his Article II powers. The speaker added that a resolution to bar U.S. military action in Iran is unlikely to pass the House. Johnson mentioned that Rep. Massie may not advance his resolution if the Iran-Israel ceasefire holds, potentially rendering the issue moot, as Massie himself acknowledged that it "probably is."</p>

Despite this sale, Huang retains ownership of over 800 million Nvidia shares and remains ranked 12th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of approximately $126 billion.

          <p>According to a PwC consumer survey, back-to-school spending is expected to remain robust this year, with nearly three-quarters of shoppers planning to spend the same or more than in 2024. Despite economic uncertainties, families prioritize these purchases as necessities, such as specific books and required technology. Consumers are increasingly value-oriented, seeking discounts and reusing items from previous years to save money. Artificial intelligence is also playing a role, with one in five shoppers planning to use AI tools to find online deals, and Gen Z parents are more likely to shop exclusively in physical stores.</p>

          <p>Riley, a 10-year-old student from Philadelphia, is heading to New York City to compete in the NBA Math Hoops Global Championship, a board game that combines sports stats with math problems.

          <p>Man Utd are trying to mitigate their recruitment plan going wrong previously by bringing in players who are used to the Premier League and don't require settling-in time. Mbeumo cannot be the end of the reshaping of Amorim's squad - and the former Sporting boss said at the end of last season, it might take a few transfer windows to get what he wants. United need to score much more than the paltry 44 league goals they managed last season. Mbeumo's arrival should help address that shortfall but, as with Cunha, the Cameroon forward will offer more than that.</p>

          <p>The first RAF evacuation flight from Tel Aviv has landed in the UK, carrying 63 British nationals and their families who were stranded after Israeli airspace was closed due to the conflict with Iran. Passengers expressed gratitude to the personnel involved but criticized the evacuation plan as slow and disorganized. A second British evacuation flight departed Tel Aviv for Cyprus, and the Foreign Office stated that further flights would depend on demand and security. The passengers had been stuck in Israel after the conflict started this month when Israel attacked nuclear sites in Iran, prompting Tehran to respond with missile strikes.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, applied for 646 jobs over 18 months before finally receiving an offer as a trainee accountant. After facing numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, Morgan questioned the value of her university degree. Research indicates that competition for graduate roles is at a record high, with an estimated 1.2 million applications for 17,000 vacancies last year. Morgan believes that the use of artificial intelligence in resume screening may have contributed to her initial difficulties, but after adjusting her CV, she reached the assessment stage for 221 roles and had five final interviews before securing her job.</p>
