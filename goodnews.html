          <p>Steph Curry's Thirty Ink, a conglomerate owning brands like Unanimous Media and Gentleman's Cut bourbon, reported $173.5 million in revenue for 2024. A significant portion of this revenue comes from Curry's partnership with Under Armour, where he serves as president of Curry Brand. The company also reported $144 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. According to Suresh Singh, Thirty Ink's secretary-chairman, all businesses within the portfolio are profitable, which is a key differentiator from other athlete-driven ventures that don't always prioritize profit and mission.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport infrastructure across England, focusing on tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. Greater Manchester will receive ¬£2.5 billion to extend its tram network, while the West Midlands will get ¬£2.4 billion for service extensions, and ¬£2.1 billion will be allocated to start building the West Yorkshire Mass Transit program. The investment marks a move away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east, and aims to address regional inequalities. The funding is part of a five-year allocation from 2027/28 to 2031/32, doubling the current spending allocation by 2029-30.</p>

          <p>Bulgaria has been approved to join the Eurozone, potentially becoming the 21st member state to adopt the single currency. The European Commission and European Central Bank assessed that Bulgaria met the necessary requirements, paving the way for adoption by January 1, 2026. This marks a shift from the previous year's report, which cited high inflation as a barrier to entry. While there are mixed attitudes within Bulgaria regarding Eurozone membership, the country's Prime Minister supports the move, which is expected to bring more investment, trade, stability, and prosperity to the Bulgarian people.</p>

          <h2>UK Chancellor Announces U-Turn on Winter Fuel Payment Eligibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 08:00:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced changes to the winter fuel payment in the UK, widening eligibility for more people to receive the allowance this year. The payment, worth up to ¬£300 to help cover energy costs, was previously limited to those on pension credit, a policy that drew criticism. The means test will be increased to allow more pensioners to qualify, though details on the specific changes remain unclear. The government insists the partial reversal is possible due to improvements in the economic picture, following the initial decision to means-test the payment to stabilize public finances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that while paying bills on time is crucial for credit scores, it's not the only factor, and not all payments are factored into credit scores. Payments like rent-to-own, private school tuition, and utilities may not be reported to credit bureaus. Additionally, on-time payments for buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not help your credit score, and missed payments can negatively impact it. To check which payments influence your credit, review your credit report, which can be accessed for free weekly at Annualcreditreport.com.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage applications decreased by 3.9% last week, despite a slight dip in the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages to 6.92%, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Refinance applications fell by 4% for the week but were 42% higher than the same week last year, while applications for home purchases also decreased by 4% but were 18% higher year-over-year. According to Joel Kan, an MBA economist, refinance activity declined across both conventional and government segments as potential borrowers await larger rate drops. The main driver of increased purchase demand is more supply on the market, although sales should be even stronger given the highest supply level in five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data indicates that the average number of sick days taken by UK workers has decreased, with an estimated 148.9 million working days lost due to illness or injury in 2024. This equates to 2% of total working hours, a decrease of 0.3 percentage points from the previous year. Minor illnesses were the most frequent cause of absence, followed by musculoskeletal problems, and women, older employees, and those with long-term health issues had the highest rates of sick leave. Advocates are calling for sick pay reform, arguing that many workers are forced to work while ill due to financial constraints.</p>

          <p>The McDonald's Snack Wrap, a customer favorite that was discontinued nine years ago, is making a comeback to U.S. menus starting July 10. The wrap, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was removed in 2016 due to kitchen preparation complexities. The company has launched a promotional webpage with fan content and a Change.org petition, showcasing the demand for its return. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, with simplified preparation for faster service.</p>
