          <h2>Flexible Work Options May Help Teacher Retention, Advocates Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, shares her experience of returning to work part-time after having a baby, highlighting the importance of flexible working arrangements for new parents. Cole believes that offering such flexibility is crucial for addressing recruitment and retention issues in the teaching profession. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also emphasized the need for more schools to offer flexible hours, especially as data suggests a decline in the number of new teachers entering the field. Sam Alner, a computer science teacher and vice principal, notes that the demanding nature of teaching can lead to burnout, causing experienced staff to seek better work-life balance or higher salaries. The ability to provide flexible work arrangements is seen as a key factor in supporting teachers and improving the overall educational environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, restoring sight to blind animals and granting them the ability to see infrared light. The study, published in Science, details how nanowire implants made from tellurium were used in a biocompatible device to restore vision in mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, converting visible and infrared light into electrical energy. This advancement holds significant promise for treating human blindness, offering a potential solution for replacing damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. Researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong argue that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights the persistence of traditional expectations that place the burden of childcare on women, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

The Docomo emoji, introduced in 1999 with the i-mode service, helped popularize emoji in Japan and globally. New Android smartphones and feature phones will adopt Google's Noto Color Emoji or Samsung emoji instead, as Docomo's emoji have "fulfilled their role." The original set of 176 emoji was included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016.</p>
