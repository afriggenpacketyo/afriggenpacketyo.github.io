          <p>The FTSE 100, the UK's leading stock index, has reached a new record high, breaking the 9,000-point barrier and marking a gain of over 10% in 2025. Analysts attribute this surge to several factors, including investors diversifying away from US markets and the UK's perceived trade advantages following a deal with the US. The index's composition of established, reliable companies in sectors like banking and defense has made it an attractive, stable option in an uncertain global economic climate.

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes delivered a monumental performance with the ball to lead his team to a 22-run victory over India in the third Test at Lord's. Six years to the day after his 2019 World Cup final heroics at the same venue, Stokes bowled marathon spells despite recent injuries, taking crucial wickets to secure the win. The match also marked the triumphant return of fast bowler Jofra Archer after a four-year absence from Test cricket. The victory gives England a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, showcasing the team's resilience and Stokes' indispensable leadership.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is reportedly considering expanding the competition from 32 to 48 teams for the 2029 edition. The tournament, initially met with skepticism, has proven financially successful, with a $1 billion prize fund attracting top clubs. While FIFA has no current plans to make the event biennial, as suggested by Real Madrid, discussions about expansion are active, with FIFA President Gianni Infantino naming several top European clubs he would like to see participate. Concerns over player welfare remain a significant issue amid the push for a larger, more lucrative competition.</p>

          <p>This archival article from July 16, 2005, reports on the addition of Macau's historic centre to the UNESCO World Heritage list. The decision was seen as a significant boost to Macau's efforts to diversify its image beyond being just a gambling hub. The 29 designated sites, including many Portuguese-style buildings, were recognized for their unique role in the early cultural exchanges between the East and West. At the time, Macau's Chief Executive, Edmund Ho Hau-wah, described the collection of landmarks as a 'unique, peerless jewel' that now ranks alongside sites like the Great Wall of China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance for schools in England will update sex and relationships education to include topics such as misogyny, consent, and the dangers of AI-generated 'deepfakes.' The curriculum aims to help pupils identify positive male role models and understand unhealthy attitudes promoted by online influencers. The final draft avoids imposing strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be covered by the end of primary and secondary school. The updated guidance, which will be fully implemented by September 2026, also emphasizes proactive engagement with parents, who will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars. The £650 million program will apply to vehicles costing up to £37,000, with the goal of helping the country meet its 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. While the government and some drivers welcome the financial incentive, industry leaders and critics point to the significant need for more public charging infrastructure to support a widespread transition to EVs, as many households lack home charging capabilities.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler's dominant season, including seven wins and an Olympic gold medal, is being credited to his work with putting coach Phil Kenyon. A year ago, Scheffler was ranked outside the top 150 in putting despite being the best player from tee to green. Kenyon helped Scheffler with his green reading and grip, but a switch to a mallet-style putter proved to be the key turning point. The English coach, who has worked with numerous major champions, has now guided players to a 'Golden Slam' of all four majors and an Olympic title.</p>

          <p>China is poised to set a new record for the number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) launched in a single year, with 166 new funds introduced in the first half of 2025 alone. This pace puts the country on track to surpass its 2021 record of 277 ETFs. The surge is driven by strong investor demand for diversified returns and favorable regulations, including streamlined approvals and reduced fees from Chinese authorities. The trend reflects a broader global boom in ETFs, which offer investors a way to trade a basket of assets like stocks and bonds on an exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 12,000 Afghans. The protections, which shield them from deportation and allow them to work, were set to expire as part of a broader effort to make more individuals eligible for removal. The administration had argued that conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough for their return. Immigrant advocacy groups sued to block the move, and the court's intervention provides a brief reprieve while it considers the case, highlighting the precarious situation for many Afghans who fled the Taliban.</p>

          <p>Norway has become a global leader in the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly 90% of new cars sold last year being electric. In cities like Oslo, EVs now constitute up to 40% of all passenger cars on the road, resulting in cleaner air and reduced noise. This success is attributed to years of consistent government policies, including significant tax exemptions for EVs, higher taxes on gasoline and diesel cars, and heavy investment in public charging infrastructure. The country's approach, unhindered by a domestic automaker lobby, demonstrates a viable path to phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles.</p>

The area, known as Sickla, will feature 2.7 million square feet of homes, offices, and schools built primarily from cross-laminated timber. This sustainable approach aims to significantly reduce the construction sector's carbon footprint, as mass timber buildings produce far lower emissions than those made from steel or concrete. The project, which leverages Sweden's vast forest resources and cultural connection to wood, is expected to complete its first residential block by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it expects to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, following assurances from the U.S. government that export licenses will be granted. Sales of the chips, which were specifically designed to comply with earlier export controls, were effectively halted in April when a new license requirement was imposed. The policy reversal is a major win for Nvidia, whose CEO Jensen Huang has been actively lobbying against the restrictions, arguing they undermine American tech leadership. The development follows a preliminary trade framework agreement between Washington and Beijing.</p>
