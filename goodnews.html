          <h2>UK Economy Shows Unexpected Growth in First Quarter</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy exceeded expectations by growing 0.7% in the first three months of the year, primarily driven by the services sector and a significant increase in production. This strong growth occurred just before the US imposed import tariffs and UK employer taxes increased, leading analysts to caution that this rate of expansion is unlikely to persist. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted the strength of the UK economy compared to other major nations, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized the rise in employer's National Insurance payments, terming it a 'jobs tax' that could jeopardize economic progress. Some businesses are absorbing US tariffs to maintain stable prices, while others are delaying decisions due to economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has approved a $433 million joint venture between Apple supplier Foxconn and HCL Group to establish a semiconductor plant in Uttar Pradesh, with operations expected to commence by 2027. The facility will produce display driver chips for mobile phones, laptops, automobiles, and PCs, with a capacity of 20,000 wafers and 36 million chips per month. This deal aligns with Apple suppliers' increasing shift towards India amid trade tensions between the US and China. India's "Semiconductor Mission" aims to create a robust chip and display ecosystem, making this Foxconn venture the sixth semiconductor unit under the plan.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul announced that Berlin is willing to align with US President Trump's call for NATO member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. While NATO's current commitment is at least 2%, many members do not meet this target. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared his intention to transform the German army into the strongest conventional army in Europe. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that reaching the 5% target would be financially challenging for the US as well, but emphasized the importance of eliminating weak links within the alliance.</p>

          <p>Ola Aina believes that Taiwo Awoniyi's injury during a Nottingham Forest match could have been avoided if the assistant referee had raised the offside flag earlier. Awoniyi, who collided with a post while trying to get on the end of a cross from Anthony Elanga, was later placed in an induced coma following surgery for a serious abdominal injury. Aina argues that Elanga was clearly offside, but the flag was not raised until after the play due to a protocol introduced in 2020.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons to address near-record high rice prices caused by a supply shortfall. This measure involves releasing 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. Concerns arise that reducing the stockpile to around 300,000 tons, a third of the appropriate reserve level, could impact the government's response to future poor harvests or natural disasters. The government is also considering relaxing the buyback requirement for rice distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy, which experienced a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate this year, but the looming threat of U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry is not anticipated to be a significant factor. The IMF reports that Denmark's economic growth is expected to decline from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% in 2025 and 1.8% in 2026, due to anticipated weakness in export growth. However, most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, protecting it from potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Potential Dissolution of the PKK and Its Implications for Turkey</h2>

          <p>The Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) has agreed to disband after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision greeted with both celebration and uncertainty. The dissolution of the PKK, classified as a terrorist organization, could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, particularly for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). Key factors influencing Turkish politics include the peace process with the PKK and the legal status of jailed Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The fate of PKK members and the terms of weapons surrender remain unclear.</p>

          <h2>Ford Recalls SUVs for Brake Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 01:03:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential installation defect that may cause a loss of brake function while driving, increasing crash risks. The front brake lines may contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to brake fluid leaks and/or loss of brake function. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel, meaning the pedal would need to be pressed harder to apply the brakes.</p>
