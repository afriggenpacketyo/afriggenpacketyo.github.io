          <p>Amidst the ongoing federal government shutdown, California Governor Gavin Newsom has deployed approximately 30 National Guard troops to the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank to assist with humanitarian efforts. This deployment aims to address a significant increase in demand at food banks, exacerbated by the shutdown's anticipated interruption of federal food assistance for millions of low-income individuals. Newsom is fast-tracking an $80 million allocation for food banks statewide, explicitly contrasting this humanitarian mission with the federal government's controversial use of the National Guard. The Guard members expressed pride in supporting their community during this critical time, mirroring their roles in past disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, with the impact of President Trump's tariffs remaining muted. This crucial data point is released despite the government shutdown, as it's needed to determine the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. Economists note that while tariffs contribute to upward pressure on prices, businesses are absorbing some costs, blunting the full impact on consumers. This mixed economic picture complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, though analysts still anticipate a quarter-point rate cut at next week's meeting.

          <p>Dodger pitcher Roki Sasaki's walkout music, "Báilalo Rocky," has become a cultural phenomenon, cementing his appeal among Latino Dodgers fans and boosting the song globally. The infectious dembow-house track, a surprising choice for the Japanese phenom, was suggested by teammate Miguel Rojas during spring training and quickly became a dugout favorite. Sasaki's strong postseason performance, marked by clutch saves and eye-popping velocity after rebounding from a midseason injury, has further amplified the song's popularity. This unique fusion of sports and music has made "Báilalo Rocky" a breakout hit in Los Angeles this fall, delighting fans and the artist alike.</p>

          <p>West Ham United's Premier League campaign has seen its worst start in 52 years, following a recent defeat at Leeds that marked their third consecutive loss under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo. The team currently sits 19th in the table with only one win and a dismal four points this season, mirroring poor tallies from the 1930s and 1970s. Manager Nuno acknowledges numerous deep-seated problems within the club and stresses the urgent need for immediate changes in attitude, commitment, and preparation. Critics also question his tactical approach, particularly the positioning of full-backs, as the team's defensive vulnerabilities, having conceded 20 goals, become increasingly apparent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland where daylight can dwindle to under six hours, many people experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). SAD is a recurring seasonal depression, often triggered by reduced daylight, causing low mood, irritability, and a loss of energy and motivation. Experts recommend adopting "light routines," utilizing therapeutic lamps, and redesigning interior spaces to be cozy and comforting. Initiatives like Orkney's "Wintering Well" boxes, offering lamps and activity guides from libraries, aim to help communities proactively manage the mental health impacts of darker months by encouraging outdoor life and new routines.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee, a group of UK Members of Parliament, has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue that such a reduction is unlikely to achieve the government's stated goal of promoting an investment culture in the UK and would face significant opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer campaigners. With a projected £22bn Budget shortfall, Reeves is reportedly considering various tax changes, but the committee emphasizes that changes to ISAs should not be made in isolation. Cash ISAs are the most widely used type, holding £360bn across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A quiet but significant shift towards automatic cars in the UK is creating a dilemma for new drivers deciding between manual and automatic lessons. One in three cars on UK roads is now automatic, and a quarter of driving tests are taken in automatics, a trend largely driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While a manual license offers the freedom to drive any car, many aspiring automatic learners face a scarcity of instructors and higher lesson costs. The article explores personal experiences and pass rates, noting a persisting social stigma around automatic-only licenses despite the clear future trend towards electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The counting of votes for the Irish presidential election is scheduled to get underway, determining the successor to current head of state Michael D Higgins. Voters in the Republic of Ireland went to the polls on Friday, with a choice of three candidates, though one had withdrawn too late to be removed from the ballot paper. Early unofficial indications have suggested that turnout could potentially struggle to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. The two main contenders are independent politician Catherine Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys.</p>

          <p>Magnesium is gaining significant popularity as a "miracle mineral" supplement, with millions taking it for perceived benefits related to sleep, digestion, and mental health, fueling a booming global market. While magnesium is undeniably vital for over 300 different bodily processes, dietitians caution that clever marketing and social media influencers often overstate the need for supplements. Experts stress that most people can obtain sufficient magnesium through a balanced diet, and strong evidence for supplements' effectiveness in healthy individuals is limited. Moreover, excessive intake can pose health risks, including diarrhoea and nausea, and can be particularly dangerous for those with kidney disease.</p>
