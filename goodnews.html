          <p>A 23-year-old first-generation American entrepreneur expresses concern that his generation is losing faith in the traditional American Dream due to economic pressures like rising costs and stagnant wages. Citing a Harris Poll, he notes that many in Gen Z feel a 9-to-5 job is insufficient, turning instead to side hustles and social media for financial guidance. The author, who founded a fintech company after dropping out of Harvard, advocates for creating better financial tools and promoting widespread financial literacy to restore belief in economic opportunity and prevent disillusionment among young Americans.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has revealed the development process behind CHSN01, a revolutionary high-strength, low-temperature steel essential for nuclear fusion technology. The material was created to address a critical challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), where existing materials became brittle under the extreme cold and immense magnetic forces inside a reactor. This new steel can withstand temperatures near absolute zero while maintaining ductility, a decade-long achievement that places China in a leading position in advanced materials science and is crucial for building the world's first fusion power generation reactor.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has revealed the depth of his despair during the team's difficult previous season, admitting he often went to games fearing his team would not be competitive. After taking over in November 2024, he oversaw the club's worst league finish since 1990 and a crushing Europa League final defeat. Amorim is now implementing stricter rules and a new culture to uphold standards, expressing confidence in the club's future and stating his ambitious goal is to remain as manager for 20 years, backed by the support of the club's ownership.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Zhejiang University have unveiled the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer built with over 2 billion artificial neurons. This new generation of neuromorphic computing is powered by 960 specialized Darwin 3 chips, which simulate over 100 billion synapses, mimicking the structure of the human brain. The system has already been successfully used for complex tasks such as content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematics. This development represents a significant step forward in achieving more advanced, brain-inspired artificial intelligence and solidifies China's position in the field.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler is receiving praise for his comedic cameo in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2," which could help humanize his public image. Known for his dominant but often stoic and drama-free victories on the course, Scheffler's performance showcases a fun, self-effacing side. The movie cleverly plays on his real-life arrest at the PGA Championship, with a scene featuring him in an orange jail jumpsuit. This appearance is seen as a positive move for both Scheffler and the sport of golf, making the often-robotic champion more relatable to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>While major global donors like the United States and the United Kingdom are cutting their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries, notably Spain and Ireland, are increasing their commitments. The U.S. recently dismantled its primary aid agency, USAID, creating a significant funding vacuum for global health and development initiatives. In contrast, Spain has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, driven by long-standing public support. This shift could lead to a new, more collaborative and less paternalistic future for foreign aid, with former recipient nations playing a larger role.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Earthquakes Can Sustain Life in Earth's Deepest Regions</h2>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes play a crucial role in sustaining a vast, hidden biosphere deep within the Earth's crust. This deep biosphere is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass, primarily in the form of prokaryotes. The research indicates that seismic activity can generate hydrogen gas from water and fractured rocks, providing a vital energy source for these microbes to survive in extreme, isolated environments far from sunlight. This discovery helps explain how such a massive ecosystem can thrive in the darkest depths of our planet.</p>

          <p>An analysis of George Washington's early leadership of the Continental Army in 1775 highlights his crucial, though often undramatic, work in forging a unified American military force. Arriving to a chaotic assembly of colonial militias outside Boston, Washington implemented structure, discipline, and organization, overcoming his own prejudices to appoint talented men from diverse backgrounds, like Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene. This foundational period demonstrates that his character, judgment, and ability to unite disparate groups were more critical to the Revolution's ultimate success than battlefield tactics, offering a lesson on the importance of steady, pragmatic leadership.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests US Economy Shows Resilience Amid Trump's Tariff Policies, But Risks Remain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's aggressive tariff policies and trade war escalations, the U.S. economy has shown surprising resilience, with recent figures indicating 3% annualized growth in the second quarter. This resilience can be attributed to businesses stockpiling goods to soften price impacts and multinational corporations spreading tariff costs across global markets. However, warning signs are emerging, including a recent rise in the unemployment rate to 4.7% and slowing growth in the first half of the year. While a full-blown crisis has been averted for now, the long-term damage from sustained protectionism and uncertainty remains a significant threat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian protest, calling for a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid for Gaza. The "March for Humanity" went ahead despite initial police opposition after the Supreme Court authorized it, citing the urgency of the humanitarian situation. Protesters chanted and carried signs, urging the Australian government to take a stronger stance, while the event caused major traffic disruptions across the city. The march highlights growing public pressure on Australia to join other Western nations in recognizing Palestinian statehood.</p>
