          <p>The Zombies, a key band from the 1960s British Invasion, are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success. Known for hits like "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season," the group faced financial struggles and a lack of industry interest that led them to disband shortly after releasing their seminal album "Odessey and Oracle." However, the album gradually gained a cult following and is now considered a rock classic, culminating in the band's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Surviving members reflect on their unusual path to rock immortality, where their most enduring work found its audience long after they had moved on.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is "hopeful" that a government shutdown can be averted ahead of the Tuesday funding deadline. His comments followed the announcement of a Monday meeting between President Trump and the top four congressional leaders to negotiate a spending agreement. A key point of contention is the Democratic push to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced tax credits, which they argue is urgent as expiration notices will soon be sent to millions of Americans. While Republicans advocate for a short-term funding bill to allow for further negotiations, both sides have expressed a desire to find common ground and keep the government operating.</p>

          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial manufacturing model, termed a "pull" system, designed to mass-produce rockets, satellites, and other space systems with automotive-style efficiency. This approach aims to enhance quality, reduce costs, and increase flexibility in response to the exponentially growing global demand for space launches. Unlike traditional "push" systems that rely on forecasts, the pull model has final assembly stages draw components from suppliers only as they are needed. This just-in-time methodology is intended to prevent production bottlenecks and inventory issues, positioning China to dominate the future of space manufacturing as orbital payloads are projected to increase dramatically by 2045.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communications expert Dr. Kate Mason, professionals often undermine their own credibility and importance by using self-deprecating or "minimizing" language at work. She identifies three specific phrases to avoid: "It'll just take a second," which sets unrealistic expectations; "No worries if not," which signals a request is low-priority; and "I'm not an expert, but...," which immediately reduces one's authority. Mason argues that these habits, which she terms "imposing syndrome," are particularly common among women and can negatively impact their professional standing. She suggests using more direct, confident, and specific language to communicate value and ensure that requests and contributions are taken seriously.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents "Diseducators," a short story by Italian author Domenico Starnone, excerpted from his book "La Scuola." The narrative is told from the perspective of a veteran teacher who uses unconventional, theatrical methods to engage his high school students, viewing his role as a guide through the often-unpleasant truths of history and life. His classroom dynamic is challenged by a student named Ornella Zanni, who insists on changing her name daily as an act of rebellion against being defined. The teacher's attempts to playfully engage with her game eventually lead to a confrontation where she labels him a "diseducator," forcing him to re-evaluate his methods and his relationship with his students.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increase in vacancies at U.S. shopping centers, driven by the failure of national chain stores, is creating new opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national vacancy rate rising, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents to keep their properties occupied. This shift is allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to secure prime real estate that was previously unaffordable. While overall rental rates are still rising, the pace of growth has slowed, creating a market recalibration that benefits entrepreneurs looking to establish a physical presence without the prohibitive costs and long-term commitments once required for such locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial coach Andrea Ewalefo advises that automation is the most effective money management strategy for neurodivergent individuals, who may face challenges like executive dysfunction and decision fatigue. She suggests automating bill payments, savings, and investments to align with paydays, which reduces the mental energy required for financial tasks. By setting up systems where financial obligations are handled automatically upon receiving income, individuals can preserve their cognitive resources, or "spoons," for other priorities. This approach also provides the freedom to spend the remaining money without the stress of potentially missing a payment, thereby creating a more sustainable and less overwhelming financial plan that accommodates neurodivergent traits.</p>

This settlement marks the third major resolution for Dominion, following a $787.5 million settlement with Fox News and a $67 million agreement with Newsmax over similar election-related falsehoods.

          <p>According to self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi, many people are held back from increasing their income by a few limiting beliefs. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to make more money, which creates shame around seeking help or learning new skills. The second is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and consistent effort. The third and most common is procrastination, telling oneself they will start "later" when conditions are perfect, which often never happens. Sethi argues that overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking actionable steps to build wealth.</p>

Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced that a taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's ambitious goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments and aims not just to build houses but to create entire communities, though it faces challenges from rising industry costs and record-low planning approvals.</p>

          <p>An expert who helps Americans move abroad has identified six common misconceptions about expatriate life. Contrary to popular belief, living abroad is not as cheap as many think, with housing costs rising globally. The idea that Americans are unwelcome is also largely false; anti-tourism sentiment is typically aimed at its impact on housing, not individuals who integrate. Other myths include the fear of loneliness, as expat communities form quickly, and the illusion that life abroad is perfect, as bureaucracy and personal challenges still exist. Finally, she advises that the first move doesn't have to be permanent and that it is never too late in life to make the leap.</p>
