          <h2>Psychiatrist Offers Five Simple Parenting Rules for Raising Successful Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 11:46:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist with extensive experience working with young adults, shares five fundamental parenting principles aimed at simplifying the often-complex landscape of child-rearing. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts over influencer trends, embracing cultural traditions instead of clickbait, and focusing on a child's individual interests rather than conforming to crowds. The advice also underscores the importance of prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones and being authentic rather than striving for perfection, all of which contributes to raising well-adjusted children. By following these guidelines, parents can reduce anxiety and create a nurturing environment for their children's growth. The main point is to be yourself, not your ideal self.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, edging out his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, suggesting that recent rule changes aimed at limiting front wing flexing have had little impact on McLaren's performance. Despite Red Bull's hopes that the changes would hinder McLaren, Piastri's performance demonstrated the car's strength, with the gap between pole position and Verstappen being larger than in previous races. Norris acknowledged errors on his final run, while Piastri credited the car's performance throughout the weekend, and Verstappen cited issues with tire preparation. The rule change had limited impact on McLaren and the way they prepared their car for the race.</p>

          <p>A call has been made for Ukraine to be urgently provided with the ‚Ç¨300 billion of frozen Russian assets, primarily held in Euroclear, to bolster its fight against Russia. Confiscating these funds would serve as a significant blow to Putin, both financially and symbolically, and would provide Ukraine with much-needed resources. While Euroclear and some EU governments express concerns about undermining Europe's reputation as a safe haven for investors, proponents argue that the extreme circumstances justify the action. The funds could be used as collateral for loans or directly transferred to Ukraine to support its defense and reconstruction efforts.</p>
