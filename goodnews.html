          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings and provided a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter. However, the company anticipates a $1.5 billion hit to revenue throughout the fiscal year due to new U.S. regulations restricting the export of advanced AI chips to China. Despite these challenges, AMD CEO Lisa Su remains optimistic, citing powerful tailwinds from the company's leadership product portfolio, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. AMD's chips are being used to train AI, and a major AI model developer is using AMD chips to deploy their service, a process called inference.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive reported first-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations but adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital expenditures due to the effects of President Trump's tariffs. The company anticipates incurring additional expenses of a couple thousand dollars per vehicle as a result of tariffs, which include 25% on imported auto parts. Rivian reconfirmed plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year, but the new guidance includes lower delivery expectations and higher capital spending.

          <p>During a meeting between President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, tensions simmered beneath the surface as both leaders sought to maintain a cordial facade. Trump reiterated his suggestion that Canada could become the 51st U.S. state, to which Carney firmly responded that Canada is not for sale. The two leaders also clashed on trade, with Trump indicating he would not lift tariffs on Canada. Carney emphasized the importance of the long-term partnership between the two countries and vowed to defend Canada's interests during upcoming trade negotiations. Carney's strategy was described as ‚Äúelbows up,‚Äù a hockey term for offering a stiff defense.</p>

Zendaya's white suit evoked Bianca Jagger's wedding attire, and Jennie channeled Mary Poppins in Chanel. Other standouts included Venus Williams in a tennis-inspired ensemble, Bad Bunny with a bowling bag, and Lewis Hamilton in white tie and tails.

          <p>Starting May 7th, the U.S. government will require travelers to present a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, at airport security checkpoints. This change aims to enhance security by setting a more consistent standard for state-issued documentation. Real IDs are marked with a star, but enhanced driver's licenses, offered in a few states, also comply. While a Real ID is sufficient for domestic flights, a passport is still needed for international travel. The TSA may allow passengers without Real IDs to fly after additional identity verification, but delays are possible.</p>

The outage, caused by a flawed software update, led to the cancellation of approximately 7,000 Delta flights. Passengers accused Delta of providing partial refunds only if they waived further legal claims.</p>

          <p>With Mother's Day approaching, flower prices may be higher due to tariffs enacted by President Trump. While he paused tariffs announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. Since about 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, consumers can expect to pay more. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers, and some are trying to source more wild, local flowers to avoid the tariffs.</p>
