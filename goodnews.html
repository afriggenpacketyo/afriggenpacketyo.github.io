          <p>President Trump's desired military parade was less a display of power and more a historical presentation of the U.S. Army. The event, while costly and controversial, ultimately avoided the authoritarian overtones some feared.  The Army's focus on service, sacrifice, and duty contrasted with the deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, highlighting the complexities of the military's role in American society.</p>
