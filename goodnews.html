          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 21:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the world's first AI nuclear warhead inspector, as detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, potentially impacting international disarmament talks. The AI system, built on a joint Chinese-American protocol, aims to verify warhead specifications. The project faced challenges including training the AI with sensitive nuclear data and ensuring the system's security against leaks, but the first step of training the AI has been successfully completed. Due to the classified nature of nuclear warheads, specific data used for training cannot be disclosed, but the technology could significantly alter nuclear weapon management. Optimism that this technology will make a positive impact is somewhat tempered by the inherent risks associated with AI and nuclear weapons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is implementing a sweeping outdoor smoking ban starting July 1, prohibiting smoking in parks, beaches, bus stops, and near schools. Violators could face fines up to $153, with enforcement primarily handled by regular police and public self-regulation. The ban aims to protect children from secondhand smoke, but exemptions are made for outdoor caf√© seating areas. E-cigarettes are currently excluded from the restrictions, but future limits on nicotine levels in vapes are under consideration, and the move expands France's existing anti-smoking laws, which have already banned smoking in restaurants and indoor public places since 2008.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government announced that China has agreed to start procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the Fukushima wastewater release. Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban and open registration for Japanese facilities. However, restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures will remain in place, and this agreement follows a previous agreement to gradually resume seafood trade under third-party monitoring.</p>
