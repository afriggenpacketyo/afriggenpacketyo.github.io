          <p>Aiden Markram's unbeaten century has propelled South Africa to the brink of a historic win against Australia in the World Test Championship final. After Australia posted 207, Markram's stellar innings, coupled with Temba Bavuma's resilient 65, established an unbroken 143-run partnership, leaving South Africa needing 69 runs on day four. A victory would end South Africa's long wait for a major men's final win, potentially shedding their reputation as international cricket's chokers. The match's outcome hinges on whether Australia's bowlers can produce a remarkable performance to alter the course of the game.</p>

          <p>The new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, previously linked to hospitalization surges in Asia, could now account for over a third of COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to CDC projections. While the CDC notes the precision of these estimates is low, the variant's high transmissibility is a concern, though it doesn't appear to cause more severe illness than previous strains. Symptoms are similar to earlier strains, including respiratory issues and systemic symptoms like fever and fatigue. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has adjusted vaccine access, approving updates for seniors and those with underlying conditions but requiring further trials for wider use.</p>

          <p>Many countries face shortages of blood donors, leading scientists to explore the creation of artificial, lab-made blood. Researchers are pursuing various approaches, including genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood type with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. While promising, these blood substitutes carry risks, such as triggering anaphylactic reactions, and must replicate all functions of biological blood. Though several methods are nearing readiness, safe artificial blood production at scale remains years away, emphasizing the continued importance of human blood donations.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk, based on clinical trials showing boosted immune responses in younger adults. While the FDA approves vaccines, the CDC sets recommendations for who should receive them, and currently recommends RSV vaccination only for those 75 and older or those 60 and over at increased risk. The CDC's vaccine advisory committee, recently restructured, will need to vote on recommending the vaccine for the new age group, followed by a final recommendation from the CDC director. The future of RSV vaccination recommendations remains uncertain, especially with skepticism towards mRNA technology among some new committee members.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song ‚ÄúBye Bye‚Äù called ‚ÄúBye Bye 25,‚Äù inspired by terms the Trump administration has tried to minimize from public life. The song lists terms like "mental health, electric vehicle, Gulf of Mexico" which PEN America has documented as being scrubbed from government websites. Gordon noted the relative lack of protest music in response to Trump's second term, and she hopes her song will describe what's going on by highlighting the dark absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language. The song avoids sloganeering, instead presenting a ridiculous jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on.</p>
