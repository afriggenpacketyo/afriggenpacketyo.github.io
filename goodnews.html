          <p>Shohei Ohtani returned to the MLB mound for the first time since August 2023, pitching one inning and driving in two runs in the Los Angeles Dodgers' 6-3 win against the San Diego Padres. Ohtani allowed one run on two hits, with his fastball reaching 100 miles per hour. He also contributed offensively, going 2-for-4 with a run-scoring double and an RBI single. This marked Ohtani's first pitching appearance since undergoing elbow surgery and his performance at the plate further cemented his role as a key player for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to further reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, but at a slower pace, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5%. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen ($1.4 billion) per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. The total amount of purchases will decline to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027.

          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. The precious metal's appeal stems from its independence from government liabilities, attracting investors concerned about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical risks. While the dollar index has weakened and U.S. Treasurys faced sell-offs due to tariff rollouts and credit rating downgrades, gold prices have consistently reached new highs. Gold is considered a large, liquid, and apolitical market, making it a preferred safe haven in uncertain times. (not investment advice)</p>
