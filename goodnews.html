          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer strongly advocated for purchasing shares of Boeing, a recent addition to his investment club's portfolio. He advised members to "pound the table" on the stock, viewing its recent price decline as a prime buying opportunity. The drop in Boeing's share price is reportedly linked to delays in the certification of its new 777X jet. Cramer's bullish stance suggests confidence in the aircraft manufacturer's long-term prospects despite the current setbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing increased competition from AI advancements and regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's stock has risen more than 30% this year, demonstrating strong investor confidence in its market position and future prospects.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Determines Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective Power Source</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, has found that renewable energy sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce. Even without government subsidies, their production costs are lower than those for coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. Experts note that while the initial capital investment for renewables is high, their operating costs are extremely low. The report also considers the impact of President Trump's new tariffs, which are projected to increase costs for projects reliant on imports.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates; Experts Advise Key Financial Moves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:51:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2024, prompting financial experts to recommend several strategies for consumers. With rates on savings accounts likely to fall, now is an opportune time to lock in high yields with CDs or high-yield savings accounts. For those with debt, the cut offers a chance to pay down high-interest balances, as variable rates on credit cards may slightly decrease. The move could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable for prospective buyers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:49:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Monday, a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments, U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF). This borrowing indicates some temporary tightness in the financial system as banks manage funding obligations related to tax payments and Treasury security settlements. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding shortages. Analysts suggest the liquidity pressure is likely to be short-lived and not a sign of a broader funding crisis in the banking sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is instructing customers not to return the product to stores due to the safety hazard. Instead, they should carefully dispose of the unopened bottles and can receive a full refund by presenting the recall notice in-store.</p>
