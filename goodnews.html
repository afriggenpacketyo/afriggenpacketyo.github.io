          <p>U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite tariff-induced economic headwinds. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2% for the third consecutive month, aligning with economists' expectations. While job growth was slightly weaker than in previous months, health care and leisure/hospitality sectors saw the largest gains, whereas federal employment declined. Experts caution that economic challenges may still lie ahead, with concerns about stagflation and a weakening employment picture, but the numbers suggest the job market is holding up.

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 5% climb after a significant drop fueled by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The disagreement led to a $152 billion rout in Tesla's market capitalization. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between Musk and Trump could benefit Tesla shares, citing the mutual need for cooperation between the two figures. Despite the recent volatility, analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Tesla's autonomous future, valuing it at $1 trillion.</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's absence from preparations for a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as subsequent trade talk announcements, has sparked questions about his influence on U.S.-China relations. The call, which followed a 90-day truce, has renewed hopes of easing tensions over tariffs and rare earth minerals. Some observers suggest a shift in Washington's approach to China, driven by economic pragmatism and Trump's preference for direct deal-making. This shift may indicate a diminished role for Rubio in shaping bilateral ties, as past engagements involved top diplomats and national security advisors.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) may disrupt entry-level jobs for recent college graduates, potentially eliminating or reshaping positions. AI's capacity to perform written and computational tasks could replace roles in fields like computer programming and law.

          <p>Hiring slowed in May, but remained sturdy, as businesses warned of uncertainty tied to President Donald Trump's tariff policy, according to federal government data released Friday. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, marking solid growth but a slowdown from 177,000 jobs added in the previous month. Federal government employment declined by 22,000 jobs in May, bringing total losses in the federal government to 59,000 since January. The fresh data revealed the performance of a key measure of economic health as Trump rolled back some of the "Liberation Day" tariffs imposed a month earlier.</p>
