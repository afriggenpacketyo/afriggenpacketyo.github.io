          <h2>Chinese Satellite Achieves High-Speed Data Transmission with Low-Power Laser</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 01:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has reportedly achieved a data transmission speed five times faster than Starlink by using a 2-watt laser from a satellite in stationary orbit. The satellite, positioned 36,000 kilometers above Earth, transmitted data at 1Gbps despite atmospheric turbulence, which typically scatters light. The scientists combined adaptive optics and mode diversity reception to overcome this challenge, marking a significant advancement in satellite laser downlink technology. This could potentially enable high-definition movie downloads from Shanghai to Los Angeles in under five seconds. The advancement highlights China's growing capabilities in space-based communication technologies and its potential to surpass existing systems. The stability of this technology will need to be proven before it can be deployed on a large scale, but the initial results are promising.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix soared to a more than two-decade high following reports that its parent company, SK Group, is planning to build South Korea's largest AI data center. SK Group is reportedly partnering with Amazon Web Services for the project, with SK Telecom and SK Broadband leading the initiative. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has benefited significantly from the AI boom. The company has become a leader in high bandwidth memory used in artificial intelligence servers, supplying to clients such as Nvidia, while rival Samsung struggles to capitalize on AI-led demand (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases starting April of next year, while holding the benchmark interest rate steady at 0.5%. The central bank plans to reduce monthly bond purchases by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, aiming for a monthly purchase amount of approximately 2 trillion yen. This adjustment is intended to improve the functioning of the Japanese government bond markets and support market stability. Despite high inflation, the BOJ acknowledged increasing economic growth uncertainty and indicated it would continue raising rates once it has greater confidence that underlying inflation will approach 2% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Gold has emerged as the leading safe haven asset, outperforming traditional options like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys.

Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal due to its independence from government liabilities.

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer secured a tariffs deal with the US, announced alongside President Trump at the G7 summit. The agreement removes tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, preventing significant job losses in the West Midlands. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding the origin of the steel. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, with officials ensuring no changes to UK food safety standards. While not a full-fledged US-UK trade deal, it represents an achievement for Starmer on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed up to the first 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners who end a pregnancy outside the existing law. Stella Creasy's amendment will be different, though it is not described in this article, and the main abortion providers are backing the amendment. The vote could result in significant changes to abortion laws.</p>
