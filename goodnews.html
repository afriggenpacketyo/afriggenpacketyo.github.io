          <p>Germany is working to improve its cybersecurity infrastructure in response to increasing cyberattacks targeting state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure. The country is playing catch-up, particularly among small and medium-sized companies and state authorities, according to Christian D√∂rr from the Hasso Plattner Institute. These attacks, which include DDoS and ransomware incidents, are becoming more professional and sophisticated, with attackers increasingly utilizing AI. Germany is investing in advanced technologies such as sensor-equipped fiber cables to detect suspicious activities near critical infrastructure. The country emphasizes closer cooperation between state and businesses to enhance resilience and ensure the safety and functionality of society.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with many expressing a desire to live in a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are not allowed, promoting real-world interactions and digital detox retreats. Studies indicate that young people spend a significant amount of time on their phones but often feel worse after using social media. Some countries are considering measures like mandatory curfews and raising the age limit for social media use to combat the harmful effects of excessive smartphone usage. The Dutch Offline Club aims to normalize phone-free spaces and offline communities, offering a way for people to reconnect with themselves and others.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways has become the first private rail operator in the UK to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire network by the end of 2027. This move aims to address the poor reputation of Britain's railways, marked by frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed it as a watershed moment, ending 30 years of fragmentation. The Labour government anticipates savings of up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators. Southeastern and Eastern services are slated for nationalization by the end of 2025.</p>

Physicians and social workers are calling for the abolishment or reduction of these restrictions, citing a lack of scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness.

          <p>A recent study published in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that stress can spill over from humans to their pets, likely due to emotional contagion and changes in care routines. The study highlights the importance of avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect the well-being of dogs.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, marking the first train company to return to public ownership under the Labour government. The government is emphasizing service improvements and reinvestment in infrastructure, but is not promising lower fares. The rail service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed the move as a "real watershed moment," assuring passengers they will get "great value for money."</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has committed to fully reinstating winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The announcement comes as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces increasing pressure from Labour MPs to address both policies. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move is expected to highlight divisions within the Labour party, with Reform UK positioning itself as an alternative for left-leaning voters.</p>

          <p>New York City's public beaches have opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, falling short of the required number due to a continuing shortage. City officials are hopeful that staffing will increase as summer approaches and more lifeguards complete training. The Parks Department has implemented incentives, such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses, and improved lifeguard stations to attract more recruits. Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, while city officials emphasize the importance of water safety.</p>

          <h2>Feminist Author Susan Brownmiller Dies at 90, Reshaped Views on Sexual Assault</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 20:13:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist known for her influential book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual assault," has died at the age of 90. Brownmiller's book redefined societal understanding of sexual assault, framing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Her work contributed to significant legal and social changes, including the establishment of rape-crisis centers and the revision of laws to ease prosecution of perpetrators. While her views sparked controversy, particularly regarding pornography and personal responsibility, her impact on the feminist movement remains significant.</p>
