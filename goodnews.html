          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has signaled its willingness to engage in deeper dialogue with other nations regarding export controls on rare earth minerals, while also approving export applications for qualified companies. This move comes as global demand for medium and heavy rare earths increases, particularly in sectors like robotics and new energy vehicles. China emphasizes its role as a responsible major power, taking into account the legitimate civilian needs of other countries. This development coincides with Vice-Premier He Lifeng's upcoming trip to London for economic and trade consultations with the United States, where rare earths are expected to be a key topic of discussion. </p>

She believes that offering such flexibility is crucial to addressing ongoing issues with recruitment and retention in teaching. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also supported the idea of more schools offering flexible hours, as pay and working conditions have been key drivers for teachers leaving the profession. Data suggests a decline in the number of new teachers joining the profession, with targets for trainee teacher recruitment being missed for several years. </p>

The announcement was made via a Facebook post, humorously emphasizing that despite the agency's affinity for Costco's food offerings, the membership cards do not meet the necessary security standards. The confusion likely stems from the presence of gold stars on Costco cards, similar to those found on REAL ID-compliant documents. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to establish uniform standards for identification sources. </p>

          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help address China's declining birth rates. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers lead to greater long-term fertility gains compared to subsidizing mothers alone. This policy proposal comes as China grapples with a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The findings challenge traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women, particularly in East Asian countries. </p>

          <p>NTT Docomo, a Japanese telecom giant, will discontinue its original emoji set after 26 years, marking the end of an era for the visual language that shaped digital communications.

The Docomo emoji set was even included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2016. </p>
