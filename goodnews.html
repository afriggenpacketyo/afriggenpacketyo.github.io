        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing the Trump administration's challenge to lower court orders that block the president's birthright citizenship policy. The administration argues that district court judges overstepped their authority by issuing nationwide injunctions. These injunctions halt the policy's implementation beyond the specific parties involved in the lawsuits. The ACLU argues that limiting injunctions would make it harder to challenge illegal government actions. The court's decision could significantly impact the power of district court judges to block presidential policies and the ability of the executive branch to implement its agenda. The case highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and judicial branches regarding policy implementation.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that even with the recent softening of tariffs on Chinese goods, the company may soon have to raise prices on some items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that President Trump's tariffs are impeding Walmart's ability to maintain low prices. While the retailer will try to absorb some of the cost increases, higher prices are expected to go into effect later this month. This announcement comes amidst global economic uncertainty and ongoing trade negotiations, impacting Walmart's profit outlook. The company earned $4.4 billion in the last quarter, a decrease from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers at 75 U.S. stores are striking to protest the company's new dress code, which requires employees to wear solid black shirts and khaki, black, or blue denim bottoms. The union, Starbucks Workers United, argues that the dress code should be subject to collective bargaining. Employees criticize the company for selling branded clothing that they are now prohibited from wearing. Starbucks maintains that the strike has a limited impact and that over 99% of its stores remain open. The company also states that it would be more productive if the union returned to the bargaining table to finalize a contract.</p>

          <p>The UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" according to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, after experiencing stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first quarter of the year. The growth was driven by increased consumer spending and business investment, marking the period just before new US tariffs and UK employer taxes took effect. While the Labour government emphasizes the need for more progress, the opposition criticizes the rise in employer's National Insurance payments. Analysts caution that the strong growth rate is unlikely to continue, but business leaders remain reasonably confident about the UK's economic prospects.</p>

He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, citing the possibility of more frequent and persistent supply shocks. Powell's remarks suggest the Fed faces a difficult balancing act between supporting employment and controlling inflation. While he didn't directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he acknowledged their potential to slow growth and boost inflation.

          <p>Experts recommend careful planning when borrowing from home equity, especially in a high-interest rate environment. Home equity loans and HELOCs can offer lower interest rates than unsecured loans, but it's crucial to shop around for the best rates and terms. Understanding fees, choosing the right term, and knowing when to borrow are also important considerations. Financial advisors suggest focusing on the purpose of the funds rather than trying to time interest rate drops. Following these rules can help homeowners make informed decisions about tapping into their home equity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are divided over whether to raise or abolish the $10,000 cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Republicans from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey are pushing for a higher cap, while others support maintaining the current limit. The debate has created a major stumbling block for passing a tax proposal that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts. The issue is particularly precarious for Republicans in competitive districts, as voters are sensitive to changes that could increase their tax burden. The article highlights the political challenges of balancing competing interests within the Republican party.</p>
