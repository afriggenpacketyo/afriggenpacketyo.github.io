          <p>India's central bank exceeded market predictions by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting a slowdown from the previous year. While the RBI acknowledges limited room for monetary policy to further support growth, it shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative" and will carefully assess incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>The UK government has banned six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives if they fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have criminal convictions. This measure, part of the strengthened Water Act, addresses public outrage over sewage spills and rising bills despite substantial executive rewards. The ban, effective retroactively from April 2024, applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, with regulator Ofwat empowered to reclaim bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the end of profiting from pollution, while acknowledging the need for water firms to rebuild trust with customers. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 03:34:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's overcapacity in manufacturing, driven by weak domestic demand and export tariffs, is creating a 'China shock' for global markets, leading to concerns about a flood of cheap imports squeezing local industries. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., the production overdrive is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory. Despite these concerns, economists note that the influx of low-cost Chinese goods could alleviate inflationary pressures for inflation-burdened economies, potentially prompting central banks in Asia to consider further rate cuts. Nomura predicts additional rate cuts from central banks across Asia, including India, the Philippines, Thailand, Australia, Indonesia, and South Korea. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz is preparing to compete against Lorenzo Musetti in the second semi-final.

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, with plans to move the damaged vessel to a dry dock for repairs. State media reported the ship's balance was restored in early June, and it was safely moored at the pier. Leader Kim Jong Un, who witnessed the failed launch, deemed it a 'criminal act' and ordered swift repairs before the late-June plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the quick action, attributing it to an innovative approach using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship‚Äôs hull to help balance and refloat it.</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC challenges common myths about AI's impact, finding that AI makes workers 'more valuable, not less,' and that jobs and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The report, analyzing over 800 million job ads and company financial reports, found that productivity growth in industries positioned to adopt AI has nearly quadrupled since 2022. Wages for workers with AI skills are 56% higher, and employer demand for formal degrees is declining in AI-exposed jobs. The report suggests that AI can enrich automatable jobs, freeing up employees for more complex tasks, and that softening job growth in AI-exposed occupations could benefit countries with declining working-age populations.
