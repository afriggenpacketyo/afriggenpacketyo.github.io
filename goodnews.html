          <p>A 37-year-old Chinese tourist was slashed with a knife in Kyoto, Japan, following an argument with an assailant unknown to him. The incident occurred in the Shimogyo Ward, a popular tourist area, around 8:25 p.m. local time. The tourist, part of a group tour, was hospitalized with a non-life-threatening cut from his right clavicle to his flank, while the attacker remains at large, prompting a police investigation into the circumstances surrounding the altercation and subsequent assault. The incident underscores safety concerns for tourists in popular destinations. Optimism surrounding the resolution of the case is moderate given the ongoing investigation. </p>

          <p>While individual optimization through diet and exercise is often touted as the key to longevity, public health scientist Devi Sridhar argues that broader societal factors, such as public policy, infrastructure, and community, play a more significant role in determining health and lifespan. Sridhar, who aims to live to 100, highlights that countries and regions where people live longer, healthier lives have governments and cultures that normalize healthy living through affordable nutritious food, clean air policies, and preventive healthcare. She emphasizes that achieving better health for all requires collective responsibility and policy changes that prioritize well-being. The focus should shift from individual self-help to creating environments that support healthy living for everyone. </p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant and independent, seeking to reduce its reliance on the United States for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy.

French President Emmanuel Macron is a leading proponent of this vision, emphasizing the need for Europe to assert its own strength and influence on the global stage.

The discovery was made through DNA testing and genealogy research, which revealed a mismatch in family history. The case is one of several instances of babies being mistakenly switched in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Lawyers anticipate more such cases coming to light due to the increasing availability of affordable genetic testing. </p>
