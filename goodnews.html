          <p>New estimates suggest that Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, matching the adjustment made in 2025. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is intended to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation. The official COLA for 2026 will be calculated based on third-quarter inflation data and announced in October, though the estimate is subject to change depending on economic factors such as President Trump's tariff policies. A 2.5% COLA increase would be considered about average, according to analysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is rehiring over 450 previously fired employees across multiple divisions within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The rehired workers come from divisions including the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention (NCHHSTP) and the National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH). This move follows the Trump administration's efforts to reorganize HHS, which initially led to layoffs, but some staffers are being reinstated. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. acknowledged that some personnel cuts were made in error and are being corrected to maintain critical public health functions.</p>

This protection is available to players ranked in the world's top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks out of competition for the procedure. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, praised the rule for reducing the pressure on players to rush back to the court too quickly. She has twice used the off-season to freeze her eggs, noting the importance of adequate recovery time.</p>

Reeves said the review would deliver security, economic growth, and "an NHS fit for the future", but Conservative shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride predicted tax rises.
