The agency released images from the missions, including one showing a burning vessel that had been intercepted.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, this article breaks down the significant tax bill a potential winner would face. The winner can choose between an annuity worth the full amount or a lump sum cash option of approximately $826.4 million. Regardless of the choice, the prize is subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding upfront, which would reduce the cash option by about $198.3 million. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, millions more would be owed at tax time, in addition to potential state taxes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned the construction of homeless shelters, settling a lawsuit filed by the state. Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that under the agreement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 to new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community last year, arguing the ban violated fair housing and anti-discrimination laws. City leaders had previously defended the ban as a negotiating tactic to address what they called broken promises from other agencies regarding homelessness support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery winnings, allowing a winner to keep more of their prize after federal taxes are paid. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would result in the lowest after-tax payout. The report also explores historical data on the most and least frequently drawn numbers, while noting that the odds of winning the jackpot remain extremely low at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complexities of determining a "good" monthly retirement income for 2025, noting that the ideal amount varies based on location, lifestyle, and health. While financial planners often suggest aiming for 75% to 85% of pre-retirement income, the current U.S. median retirement income is closer to $3,900 per month. The piece discusses strategies for generating additional guaranteed income streams to supplement Social Security. These include purchasing annuities, utilizing reverse mortgages for homeowners over 62, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The package would award Musk approximately 423 million shares, valued at $143 billion today, if the company achieves ambitious milestones. These targets include reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and hitting significant production goals for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. The proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 following a shareholder lawsuit. (not investment advice)</p>

Norris finished just 0.083 seconds ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with Carlos Sainz of Williams in third. Piastri, who missed the first practice session, finished fourth fastest, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.50%, its lowest level since October 2024, providing some relief for potential homebuyers. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to announce a reduction at its next meeting. Lenders often lower their rates preemptively in response to expected Fed actions and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. While rates are still relatively high, the downward trend is an encouraging development for a housing market that has been constrained by high borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, enabling the U.S. to punish countries that illegally detain American citizens. This measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, will provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations using detained Americans as political leverage. The move aims to deter the practice and encourage the release of currently held individuals. The order follows several high-profile cases where Americans, such as Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan, were detained in countries like Russia and later released in prisoner swaps.</p>

The iconic prop was created from a modified 1950s camera flash attachment and shows authentic signs of wear from its extensive use during filming.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a bill that raises the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This changes the $10,000 cap that was implemented by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had limited a deduction that was previously unlimited for over a century. The SALT deduction primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who can deduct property and state income taxes from their federal tax liability. The higher cap is projected to increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>
