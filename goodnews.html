          <p>Following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, Syrian business owners express renewed optimism as President Trump announces the end of U.S. sanctions on Syria. These sanctions, dating back to the 1970s, were intended to pressure the Assad regime but have severely impacted the Syrian economy, leaving most of the population in poverty. While some Western governments eased restrictions earlier, the Trump administration had set conditions for their removal, including assurances regarding Iran's influence and the protection of minorities. Syrian business leaders are now planning to return and contribute to rebuilding the country, contingent on the actual lifting of sanctions and the restoration of economic stability.</p>

          <p>Many homeowners are finding their home equity "trapped" due to elevated interest rates and stricter lending requirements. While home values have increased, accessing that equity is challenging. Experts suggest exploring alternative borrowing options like HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) or home equity loans, which allow homeowners to tap into equity without refinancing their existing mortgage. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history can also improve access to home equity borrowing products, enabling homeowners to leverage their built-in wealth.

While Walmart beat quarterly earnings expectations, it declined to provide specific guidance for earnings per share due to fluctuating tariff policy.

While some attribute this to erratic trade war factors and a bounceback from stagnation, the resilience suggests that interest rate cuts and relative political and economic stability may have had a more significant impact. Real incomes are up, and many businesses outside retail and hospitality have accommodated the rise in National Insurance contributions by squeezing profit margins and wage rises, potentially altering the frame of thinking about the British economy.</p>

This missing code affects the ARHGAP36 gene, which regulates skin, eye, and fur tone production, leading to lighter colors. The research, funded by cat lovers, also explains why ginger cats are predominantly male, as the gene is carried on the X chromosome. The scientists hope that solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions.</p>
