          <p>The British government is increasing defense spending by ¬£2 billion, focusing on drones and adapting tactics from the Ukraine war to enhance military readiness, according to The Guardian. Defence Secretary John Healey stated the Army's lethality would significantly increase. The Times highlights that Prime Minister Starmer plans to expand the British Army for the first time in a generation, but experts warn this could lead to substantial tax hikes. The Financial Times reports submarines are central to the review, with plans for 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines. The i Paper notes the review suggests a military "gap year" for over-18s, offering paid military training instead of national service.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. An Education Department spokesperson stated this decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who often rely on fixed incomes. This policy shift provides older borrowers more time to address their defaulted loans and avoid reduced benefit checks. Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two shark divers who were convicted of theft for releasing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline off the Florida coast. The divers believed the line was illegal and freed the animals, later reporting the incident to wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely.</p>
