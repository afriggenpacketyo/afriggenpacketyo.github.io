          <p>Experts predict possible mortgage rate scenarios for the summer, considering factors such as inflation, employment, and consumer spending. While a dramatic swing in mortgage rates is not expected, minor fluctuations are possible, with rates potentially remaining stable in the high 6% range. An optimistic prediction suggests a modest decline, potentially averaging around 6.6% by August. Experts recommend focusing on controllable variables such as rate buydowns and exploring different loan programs, as trying to time the market perfectly can lead to missed opportunities.

WhatsApp will instead use the country, city and language of the user, as well as how they interact with other ads and which channels they follow, to drive suggested content.
