        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has indicated that the bank will become involved in stablecoin technology to better understand and compete in the evolving payments landscape. While expressing personal skepticism about the utility of stablecoins compared to traditional payment systems, Dimon acknowledged the threat posed by innovative fintech competitors. The move is part of a broader trend among major financial institutions, including Citigroup and Bank of America, exploring tokenized deposits and stablecoins for potentially faster and cheaper transactions. This engagement aims to prevent ceding ground in the global payments industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a preliminary trade deal with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods imported into the U.S. while granting American exports tariff-free access. The announcement, made following direct talks with Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, suggests a reduction from a previously threatened 32% duty. However, as of the report, the Indonesian government had not yet confirmed the terms described by Trump. This development follows a similar pattern to a recent trade announcement with Vietnam, where official confirmation from the partner country has been delayed.</p>

          <p>Aerospace and defense firm Rolls-Royce is investing $75 million to expand its engine manufacturing plant in Aiken, South Carolina, a move expected to create 60 new jobs. The expansion will increase the production of mtu Series 4000 diesel engines, which are crucial for backup power systems in data centers and other critical infrastructure. This investment strengthens the company's U.S. industrial base and reflects a strategic shift towards the growing energy and power systems sector. The company will begin machining more components domestically, reducing reliance on finished goods imported from Germany, with production starting in 2027.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chips to China, stating the U.S. is not providing its top-tier technology. Lutnick emphasized that the approved chip is significantly slower than Nvidia's best products, and the strategy is to keep China reliant on the American "tech stack" rather than developing its own. The reversal is a major win for Nvidia, which had seen the crucial Chinese market effectively closed by previous license requirements. The policy aims to balance national security concerns with the economic benefit of maintaining U.S. tech dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A defense official stated the Pentagon is taking immediate steps to boost domestic production of critical minerals and counter China's market dominance, particularly in rare earth magnets used in advanced weaponry. This follows a recent Defense Department agreement to take a direct equity stake in MP Materials, the operator of the only U.S. rare earth mine. The official confirmed the department is exploring similar investments in other U.S. mining companies to strengthen the industrial base. The strategy reflects a broader government effort to onshore critical supply chains and reduce the nation's heavy reliance on foreign imports. (not investment advice)</p>
