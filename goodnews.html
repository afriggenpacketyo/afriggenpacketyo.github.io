          <p>Former President Donald Trump is spending the second day of his visit to Scotland on the golf course at his Turnberry resort. Amid a significant police presence and some protests, his visit is not purely recreational, as he is scheduled to meet with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to discuss transatlantic trade relations. Trump has expressed a 50-50 chance of reaching a trade agreement, which could avert potential tariffs. He is also expected to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney later in the visit to discuss trade and other international issues.</p>

          <p>With skin cancer cases on the rise, health experts are re-emphasizing the importance of using sunscreen for protection against harmful UV radiation. The article delves into the two main types of sunscreens—organic (chemical) and physical (mineral)—explaining how they both work to block UVA and UVB rays. While acknowledging public concerns and ongoing research into the safety of some long-used chemical ingredients like oxybenzone, scientists stress that the proven cancer-prevention benefits of sunscreen far outweigh the potential risks. They also caution against homemade remedies and advise on proper application, highlighting that using sunscreen remains a critical public health measure.</p>

Meanwhile, Zolciak has moved into a new home, celebrated the premiere of two new TV shows, and appears to be reconciling with her parents after years of estrangement. Despite the ongoing messy divorce proceedings, both individuals are publicly signaling a focus on rebuilding their personal and professional lives independently.</p>

          <p>China has identified a new, super-large zirconium deposit, a critical mineral for advanced technologies like hypersonic weapons and nuclear reactors. The discovery, located in a non-marine basin, is estimated to contain 2 million tonnes of zirconium dioxide, which is four times China's current total reserve. Zirconium alloys are prized for their extreme heat and corrosion resistance, making them essential for components in scramjet engines and other high-performance aerospace and defense applications. This significant find could bolster China's self-sufficiency in a key strategic resource, impacting the global race for technological and military superiority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A journalist recounts a frustrating summer travel experience on Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn, highlighting the system's notorious lack of punctuality and reliability. A planned direct trip from Berlin to the North Sea island of Föhr turned into a series of unexpected train changes, delays caused by sheep on the tracks, and a journey terminated early due to crew working hours. The personal essay reflects a broader national issue of underinvestment in rail infrastructure, leading to dilapidated tracks and staff shortages. The humorous yet critical account illustrates the stark contrast between the railway's timetable promises and the chaotic reality for passengers.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football across Europe, as seen in Euro 2025, Eastern European nations remain significantly underrepresented at top tournaments. The article explores the reasons for this disparity, with Poland being the sole team from the region at the latest Euros. Experts point to a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors, including a lack of investment, infrastructure, and societal acceptance for female athletes in traditionally patriarchal cultures. While UEFA initiatives are starting to make a difference, the legacy of post-communist economic struggles and the rise of conservative values continue to pose significant hurdles for the growth of the women's game in the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market is surging to record highs, seemingly defying widespread concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's threatened tariffs. Analysts point to several key factors driving this disconnect, including a surprisingly resilient economy with low unemployment and decent corporate earnings that have beaten pessimistic forecasts. Furthermore, many investors are operating on the belief that the president's aggressive rhetoric on tariffs is a negotiating tactic and that the final duties will be less severe. However, some experts remain cautious, warning that markets may be "priced for perfection" and vulnerable to a pullback as the real economic costs of tariffs materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

Colbert himself also joined in, promising the "gloves are off" for his remaining months on air.

          <p>The selection of Stockholm, Sweden, as the venue for the third round of U.S.-China trade negotiations highlights a shift in diplomatic strategy for the two economic superpowers. According to Sweden's trade minister, the choice reflects the country's international reputation for fostering dialogue and cooperation. Analysts suggest that holding talks in neutral European locations, following previous rounds in Geneva and London, creates a more level playing field compared to the bilateral meetings held during President Trump's first term. This move away from hosting in either the U.S. or China indicates a different, perhaps more balanced, dynamic in the ongoing high-stakes negotiations.</p>
