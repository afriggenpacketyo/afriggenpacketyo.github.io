          <p>A nonprofit organization, The Conservation Fund, has purchased land for $60 million to prevent a proposed mineral mine near Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp. The plan, which involved pumping over a million gallons of water daily, raised significant concerns among environmentalists and hydrologists about the risk of severe droughts and fires in the pristine 700-square-mile wildlife refuge. The deal marks a major victory for a bipartisan coalition of advocates who fought to protect the vital ecosystem, though the threat of future mining on other nearby private lands remains a concern for conservationists.</p>

          <p>A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 has struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula in the country's far east. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the event, which initially prompted tsunami advisories for Russia's coast and parts of Alaska's Aleutian Islands. However, these warnings were later canceled, and officials confirmed there was no tsunami threat to Hawaii or Canada. There have been no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from the remote, seismically active region.</p>

          <p>China's government-led initiatives to curb a damaging price war in the solar-equipment industry are beginning to show positive results, according to market analysts. Prices for key materials like polysilicon have risen, supported by policy sentiment favoring industry consolidation and proposed limits on manufacturing plant power usage. This recovery is expected to help leading producers return to profitability after enduring 18 months of financial losses. The measures are seen as a crucial step by Beijing to restore order and sustainable growth within its globally dominant solar sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The transaction, structured as a talent acquisition rather than a full purchase, provides Nvidia with Enfabrica's expertise in networking technology that can connect vast numbers of GPUs. This capability is crucial for building the massive, integrated AI systems that power large language models. The move reflects a broader trend among tech giants to acquire top AI talent through large-scale hiring and licensing agreements.</p>

          <p>Despite a spirited performance and strong support from the home crowd, Newcastle United lost their Champions League opener 2-1 to Barcelona. Manager Eddie Howe praised the team's "commitment and heart" but lamented missed opportunities in the first half that could have changed the game's outcome. While a late goal from Anthony Gordon provided some consolation, the defeat highlighted the need for more clinical finishing against elite European competition. The team must now regroup and find a more ruthless edge to succeed in the tournament.</p>
