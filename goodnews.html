          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company's net sales increased by 10.6%, driven by the acquisition of Chuy's Tex Mex and the opening of new restaurants. Same-store sales also rose, with Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse outperforming expectations due to the return of Olive Garden's "Buy One Take One" deal. Darden anticipates revenue growth of 7% to 8% for the full fiscal year, indicating a positive outlook despite concerns about consumer spending. Optimism surrounding the company is furthered by the company's board of directors authorizing a $1 billion share repurchase program. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is set to release its annual stress test results, which could significantly impact Wall Street's largest banks. Analysts predict regulators may lower stress capital buffers, potentially freeing up capital for increased share buybacks and dividends. Wells Fargo is expected to be a standout, potentially receiving more relief from the Fed due to improvements in commercial real estate exposure and underlying earnings power. Goldman Sachs and Capital One are also expected to benefit, with increased flexibility for wealth management and share repurchases, respectively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Tesla has signed an agreement to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, marking its first such project in the country. The facility, located in Shanghai, is expected to be the largest of its kind in China upon completion. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems help balance electricity supply and demand, which is crucial for integrating intermittent renewable energy sources. Tesla's Shanghai factory has already produced over 100 Megapacks, each capable of providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners are exploring options like home equity loans and HELOCs. Currently, rates for both are similar, around 8.25%, but this may change due to the variable nature of HELOC rates. A $200,000 home equity loan is marginally less expensive than a $200,000 HELOC right now, but that dynamic can and almost assuredly will change over a multiple-year repayment period. Borrowers should compare offers carefully, considering potential rate fluctuations and the flexibility of interest-only payments with HELOCs (not investment advice).</p>

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill was supported by 314 votes to 291, a majority of 23. The bill, introduced by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill people to end their life if they meet certain conditions, such as being over 18, living in England or Wales, and having a terminal illness with a life expectancy of six months or less. The bill will now be reviewed by the House of Lords.</p>

          <p>The band Haim's new album, 'I Quit,' cleverly remixes the breakup-music canon for a generation wary of commitment, drawing comparisons to Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours.' The album explores unraveling commitments, with lead singer Danielle Haim's breakup from producer Ariel Rechtshaid influencing the album's themes. The music feels unshackled, with songs going on longer and doing more than expected, blending incongruous styles through ingenious transitions. The album's centerpiece tracks march from ambivalence to a different kind of ambivalence, reflecting the drama of experiencing life as a purely internal, self-directed struggle.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he believes tariffs will not significantly boost inflation. In a CNBC interview, Waller stated that the Fed should move slowly but start easing to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He emphasized that waiting for a "crash" before cutting rates is unnecessary and that the Fed has been on pause for six months with positive data. Waller's comments led to gains in stock market futures, though the FOMC recently voted to hold rates steady (not investment advice).</p>

Peers will have a free vote on the bill, and there is an expectation of support, though experts will scrutinize the details. Concerns remain about the bill running out of parliamentary time or being blocked by opposing peers through amendments. The government is officially neutral on the bill but will ensure parliamentary time is available for debate, and the bill's future depends on the scrutiny and decisions made in the House of Lords.</p>
