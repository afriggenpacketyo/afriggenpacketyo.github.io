          <p>Marks & Spencer (M&S) has announced that its online services will face disruptions until July due to a sophisticated cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend, impacting click-and-collect and contactless payments. The ransomware attack, believed to be the work of Scattered Spider using DragonForce tools, is expected to reduce the company's profits by approximately ¬£300 million this year. Despite the setback, M&S CEO Stuart Machin views the incident as an opportunity to accelerate the company's turnaround strategy, which involves updating in-store ranges, property portfolio, and back-office systems. The company anticipates insurance to cover about a third of the financial impact, while they work to mitigate additional waste and logistic costs, including potential fines for data loss and litigation.</p>

          <p>A leaked memo has revealed a debate within the Labour party regarding tax policies, with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner suggesting tax increases to Chancellor Reeves, who ultimately did not implement them. The memo proposed measures such as increasing the corporation tax rate on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the cabinet's unity, Conservatives criticized the proposals, urging the chancellor to rule out tax increases in the Autumn Budget.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede has allowed venomous snakes to bite him over 200 times, developing immunity to multiple types of venom, which has intrigued researchers about the possibility of creating a universal antivenom. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with specific venoms to produce neutralizing antibodies. Researchers studying Friede's blood hope to synthesize a treatment effective against various venomous snake bites, potentially saving countless lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, has sparked concern among some Maga Catholics due to his perceived progressive stances, which contrast with their traditionalist views. Figures like Steve Bannon and JD Vance have previously invoked religious arguments to support policies such as cutting international aid and imposing strict immigration measures. Pope Leo XIV's focus on addressing global issues like climate change, inequality, and migration challenges the nationalistic and insular worldview of the Maga movement. His choice of name, referencing Leo XIII, signals a commitment to addressing modern social and economic injustices, potentially setting the stage for a clash between the Vatican and Trumpian nationalism.</p>
