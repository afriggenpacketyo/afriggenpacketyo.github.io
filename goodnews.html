          <p>The UFC has secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, shifting away from its traditional pay-per-view model to increase accessibility. This strategic change comes as UFC President Dana White's close alignment with Donald Trump is questioned for its potential to alienate a diverse and global fanbase. The article suggests that while the partnership may appeal to a specific demographic, it could be a liability given the UFC's international roster of champions and the shifting political views of younger audiences. The move to a broader streaming and network TV platform is seen as an effort to expand the UFC's audience amid concerns over recent viewership numbers.</p>

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On Holding reported a 32% sales increase in its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and margin guidance. The popular sneaker brand now anticipates sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, demonstrating strong performance despite new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources 90% of its products. To offset the higher costs, On raised its prices in July but has not observed any negative impact on consumer demand. The company continues to gain market share, particularly in the running segment, and has seen robust growth in key markets like the Americas and China.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced the discontinuation of its dial-up internet service, effective September 30th, marking the end of an era for the technology that defined internet access for many in the 1990s. Known for its distinctive beeping and static connection sounds, dial-up provided a crucial gateway to the online world by using existing telephone lines. While largely replaced by faster broadband technology, a very small percentage of American households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on the service. The move signifies the final chapter for a service that was once ubiquitous, famously distributed via millions of free trial CDs.</p>

          <p>French football club Paris St-Germain has completed the signing of Ukrainian defender Illia Zabarnyi from Premier League club Bournemouth for a fee of €66 million (£57m). The 22-year-old center-back has signed a five-year contract with the European champions. This transfer marks the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth during this window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen to Real Madrid and Milos Kerkez to Liverpool. Despite the need to rebuild their defense, the sales are expected to generate a significant profit for the English club, which has already agreed to a deal for a replacement player.</p>

          <p>An Australian federal court has delivered a partial victory to 'Fortnite' developer Epic Games, ruling that the app stores operated by Apple and Google are uncompetitive. The court found that the tech giants' control over app distribution and in-app payment systems limits competition, although it also noted they had not intentionally breached the law. This ruling is a significant development in Epic Games' global legal battle against what it claims are excessive fees and restrictive practices. Following the judgment, Epic announced its intention to bring its own game store and 'Fortnite' to iOS devices in Australia.</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, who was stranded on an Antarctic island for six weeks, has had all charges against him dropped by Chilean authorities. The 19-year-old was detained in June after being accused of illegally landing his plane in Chilean territory and providing false flight plan information. As part of the resolution, a judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo was on a mission to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>The Greater Attleboro Taunton Regional Transit Authority (GATRA) in Massachusetts will soon offer fare-free rides on its fixed-route and paratransit services, thanks to state funding. This initiative is part of a statewide program aimed at increasing transit ridership and improving affordability for residents, many of whom have low incomes. GATRA anticipates the fare-free program will be in effect for the remainder of the fiscal year, ending in June 2026. Other regional transit authorities in the state that have implemented similar programs report significant increases in ridership and improved operational efficiency.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Wei Qiang Lin, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to illegally exporting approximately 850 protected turtles to Hong Kong by hiding them in socks inside boxes labeled as toys. The smuggled animals, primarily eastern and three-toed box turtles, are native to the U.S. and protected under international conventions. Authorities intercepted the shipments and estimated the market value of the seized turtles at $1.4 million. The case highlights the lucrative black market for these reptiles, which are prized as status symbols in China. Lin faces up to five years in prison for his role in the smuggling operation.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa in Singapore has stated the company will be ready for its next casino license renewal in 2026, following a shortened two-year renewal from regulators. The Gambling Regulatory Authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023 for its decision. Despite the rebuke, the integrated resort is proceeding with a SG$6.8 billion expansion, focusing on experiences over shopping. New attractions include Minion Land at Universal Studios and the Singapore Oceanarium, with a new luxury hotel and a Super Nintendo World also planned as part of its transformation into a premium lifestyle destination.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their current trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation of tariffs. President Trump signed an executive order to continue the pause until November 10, with Beijing confirming it would also hold its tariff rates. This extension keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extra time will be used for further negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and addressing other economic and national security issues between the world's two largest economies.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023, in response to slowing inflation and a weaker economic outlook. Concurrently, the RBA downgraded its annual economic growth forecast from 2.1% to 1.7%, citing weaker than expected public demand. The central bank noted that inflation has dropped substantially since its 2022 peak, bringing demand and supply into better balance. The decision comes amid a reshaped global trade environment but the RBA stated recent trade policy developments have had little discernible impact so far. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing cyclist in Scotland was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman who secretly marked his burial site with a Red Bull can. Dr. Caroline Muirhead's boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to her that he had killed cyclist Tony Parsons in a hit-and-run in 2017 and buried his body. After he showed her the remote location, she dropped the can as a marker and informed the police. This crucial clue led authorities to recover Parsons' body, bringing a long-awaited resolution to his family and the police investigation.</p>
