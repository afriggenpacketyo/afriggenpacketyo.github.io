          <p>Sue Ring-Jarvi, a 74-year-old pioneer of women's hockey in Minnesota, continues to foster the sport's growth through a summer league she organizes for players aged 18 to 74. Having established the first women's hockey club at the University of Minnesota in 1974, before it was an NCAA-sanctioned sport, she has created a lasting community. The league not only keeps older players active but also brings families together, with multiple generations skating on the same team. Ring-Jarvi's dedication serves as an inspiration, demonstrating how a lifelong passion can build a supportive and enduring legacy.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is becoming increasingly optimistic about the turnaround plan at Starbucks, led by new CEO Brian Niccol. Following a positive earnings report, investment firm Baird upgraded the company's stock, citing "high conviction" in Niccol's strategy to improve store operations and customer service. The "Back to Starbucks" plan focuses on enhancing the coffeehouse atmosphere and increasing service speed, with a new "Green Apron" service model showing promising results in test stores. These improvements, combined with cost-cutting measures, are expected to stabilize sales and boost profitability, justifying the stock's premium valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from JLL suggests that the rapid advancement of quantum computing is set to create a significant new demand for specialized commercial real estate, similar to the recent boom in data centers driven by AI. As quantum technology moves from academic labs to commercial viability, it will require unique facilities with features like electromagnetic shielding. While the market is still nascent, investments are projected to grow substantially, potentially reaching $50 billion around 2030. This emerging sector presents a new frontier for real estate investors, with development currently concentrated near research hubs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to sign the Sonya Massey Act, a new law mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation is named for Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home in 2024 by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous law enforcement jobs. The act will require police agencies to inspect all prior employment records, including performance reviews and fitness-for-duty exams, before making a final hiring decision. This reform aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from being hired by different departments.</p>

          <p>For retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for living expenses, financial experts suggest several strategic options. One approach is to reinvest the money in a taxable brokerage account, favoring tax-efficient assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Another popular option for those 70½ or older is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that satisfies the RMD requirement. For those focused on legacy planning, using the funds to contribute to a 529 college savings plan can also be a beneficial move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Five Key Factors to Consider Regarding Annuity Investment Safety</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines five important considerations for those evaluating the safety of annuities as a retirement investment in the current economic climate. The safety of an annuity depends heavily on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, as they are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, it's crucial to diversify across highly-rated insurers. Different annuity types carry varying risk profiles, with fixed annuities being the most predictable. Finally, prevailing interest rates and the threat of inflation eroding purchasing power are critical factors to assess. (not investment advice)</p>
