          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a massive $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors to a major, unnamed company, boosting its shares by over 2%. The deal is set to run until the end of 2033, though details regarding the counterparty are being kept confidential at their request to protect trade secrets. This long-term agreement is a significant development for Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies and has been working to catch up to competitors in the market for advanced AI-related memory chips.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets saw a rise and the euro strengthened following the announcement of a trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on most EU goods, averted a potential trade war and was hailed by some analysts as a significant win for the U.S. This development has eased investor concerns about prolonged trade disputes, providing more clarity ahead of a pivotal week featuring policy meetings from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. The agreement is seen as diffusing the risk of escalating global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material as part of an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The operation has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led and used the network, which boasted over 120,000 members and housed millions of files depicting horrific abuse. Among those convicted was a lead administrator labeled as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. Officials are touting the operation as a major victory in the fight against online child exploitation.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, at just 12 years old, is capturing global attention at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is a contender for a medal in the 200m individual medley, which could make her the youngest person to win an international swimming medal in nearly 90 years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented a new policy mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The rules state that individuals and units should not be punished or have their performance evaluations negatively affected if mistakes are made without misconduct or abuse of power. This applies to scenarios like projects stalling due to technical hurdles or market changes rendering a product unviable. The policy aims to encourage researchers to "boldly explore uncharted territories" and reduce the fear of failure in scientific and technological pursuits.</p>

          <p>An LAPD station in Pacoima was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in military explosive devices they found while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The couple arrived at the station with a plastic box containing what the bomb squad identified as several military ordnances. The squad used a robot to assess the devices before deeming them safe to transport to a secure storage facility for military collection. The incident occurred less than two weeks after an explosion killed three Los Angeles County sheriff’s detectives during a similar ordnance-related operation.</p>

          <p>European leaders have expressed relief that a trade war was averted, but acknowledged the new U.S.-EU trade deal is a significant compromise. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on most European goods, a figure higher than pre-Trump rates but lower than the threatened 30%. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz noted the deal preserved fundamental interests, particularly for the hard-hit auto industry, while Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof stated that while zero tariffs would have been better, the agreement provides crucial clarity and market stability for businesses.</p>

The tour's success, marked by sold-out shows at venues like Dodger Stadium, reflects the band's enduring influence on a generation of artists and a resurgence of interest in early 2000s rock. The performance blends the album's original theatricality with a new, satirical narrative about authoritarianism, but the show's core appeal remains the power of the songs themselves, which continue to resonate deeply with a dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <p>The Keeladi excavation site in India's Tamil Nadu state has unearthed artifacts suggesting a literate, urban civilization existed there as early as 580 BCE, challenging narratives about the origins of civilization in the subcontinent. The findings have ignited a political and historical debate, fueling Tamil pride and intensifying the cultural divide between India's north and south. State archaeologists claim the evidence points to a southern civilization as ancient as those in the north, but the transfer of the lead archaeologist and disputes over his report have led to accusations that the federal government is suppressing Tamil history.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in the competitive rivalry with his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. Piastri secured the win by making a brave move at the start and carefully managing his medium-compound tires under pressure. Norris, who started on pole, may reflect on small errors, including a mistake at the first corner and a less optimal pit strategy, that cost him a chance to challenge for the lead. The race underscored how strategy, execution, and nerve are defining the close intra-team battle at McLaren this season.</p>
