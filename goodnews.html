          <p>Star guard Damian Lillard is returning to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he spent his first 11 seasons, after being waived by the Milwaukee Bucks. Lillard shared his enthusiasm on social media with a video tribute and the message "Together Again." The nine-time All-Star is finalizing a three-year contract with the franchise where he is the all-time leading scorer. He is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from an Achilles tear, with his combined salary from both teams reaching $70 million for the 2025-26 season.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, are in favor of the United States returning to the moon and eventually undertaking a mission to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile endeavor and a source of national pride. The public also tends to believe that the space program contributes, at least somewhat, to technological advancements that benefit society as a whole.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are making significant inroads in the global AI landscape by championing open-source models. The recent releases of DeepSeek's V3 large language model and R1 reasoning model, which rivals OpenAI's technology, have disrupted the industry. This open-source approach, where source code is freely available, fosters collaboration and presents a strong alternative to the closed, proprietary systems of US tech giants. Analysts suggest that this movement poses a more serious challenge to US dominance than previous open-source efforts in other tech sectors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current ceasefire proposal reportedly includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement came during a dinner with Republican senators, where Trump praised the work of his Middle East envoy. The news follows recent indirect talks between Israel and Hamas mediated by Qatari officials.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a $160 million military aid package. This contribution is intended to significantly bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities against the ongoing Russian invasion. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort, Australia has provided over $980 million in total aid, including ammunition and defense equipment. The government has also imposed economic sanctions on Russia and has called for the conflict to be resolved on Kyiv's terms.</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who endured the horrors of the Vietnam War, found solace in a daydream about a carousel in a mountain meadow, inspired by a music box from his sister. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make his vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years carving new animals for it. In 2010, he opened the Carousel of Happiness in Nederland, Colorado, a nonprofit that has since brought joy to over a million people. Harrison says seeing others happy is good medicine and has profoundly changed his own life.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the U.S., specifically targeting the $250 billion stablecoin market. The bipartisan bill creates consumer protections and allows banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, which are digital currencies pegged to assets like the dollar. The administration hailed the act as a revolutionary step for financial technology that strengthens the dollar and upgrades the U.S. financial system for the 21st century. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) for President Trump, medical experts have provided context on the common condition. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to transport blood back to the heart, causing it to pool and lead to swelling. The condition affects about one in three adults in the U.S. and is often managed with lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise. The White House physician described the president's case as benign and common for his age, stating he remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>The 'California Forever' project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires aiming to build a new city in Solano County, has announced plans for a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site would cater to defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier tech industries, aiming to bring manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, promoted the vision as restoring the magic of "designed in California, made in California." However, the controversial project continues to face skepticism from local community groups who question the necessity of building an entire new city.</p>

          <p>After a warm and dry spring, pest control experts and entomologists in the UK are predicting a significant increase in wasp populations this summer. While official data is not yet available, the weather patterns have created ideal breeding conditions. Experts note that while social wasps can be a nuisance, they are also vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV vaccination program to offer protection to premature babies, a group highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, eligible infants will be offered a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, which offers about 80% protection with a single dose. This new initiative complements the existing program that provides an RSV vaccine to pregnant women. Health officials stated the move will strengthen the health service's winter preparedness by reducing pressures on emergency departments and hospital admissions from the common but highly infectious virus.</p>

          <p>A 2005 incident from Ethiopia is being recalled, where a 12-year-old girl was reportedly rescued from kidnappers by a pride of lions. The girl had been abducted by seven men attempting to force her into marriage and was missing for a week. According to police reports at the time, three lions chased the men away and then "stood guard" over the girl until she was found. A wildlife expert speculated that the girl's whimpering may have been mistaken for a lion cub's mewing, which could explain why the animals protected her instead of attacking.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered an interaction between a specific gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that could trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The research found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by gut bacteria overactivates an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The study opens the door to developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway.</p>
