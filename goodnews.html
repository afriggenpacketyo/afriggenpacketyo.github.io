          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals the potential earnings from a $500 Certificate of Deposit (CD) opened this month, with returns varying by term length. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% could yield $22, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could generate over $112. The article notes that while these returns are modest, they are guaranteed, which is an advantage with potential interest rate cuts looming. It also compares CDs to high-yield savings accounts, which offer similar rates but with more flexibility and variable interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min is transferring from Tottenham to the Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) for a record-breaking MLS transfer fee, reportedly around $26 million. The move is seen as a monumental event, particularly for Southern California's large Korean community, drawing comparisons to major signings by the Dodgers. Beyond the community impact, the acquisition is expected to boost LAFC's performance, increase the MLS's global profile, and help Son acclimate to North America ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The deal is considered a strategic investment for LAFC, which expects to recoup the cost through sponsorships and media rights.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is returning to the NFL, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers intending to sign him. The 32-year-old is coming out of retirement for the second time to join a quarterback room that includes Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask. The move follows Bridgewater's recent suspension from his coaching position at his Miami high school alma mater for allegedly providing financial benefits to players. Bridgewater, who has played for six NFL teams over 10 seasons, most recently joined the Detroit Lions for their 2023 playoff run before officially retiring earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Palantir's stock increased by over 6% after the data analytics company reported better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its full-year financial outlook. The company surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, driven by a surge in demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and strong growth in U.S. government contracts. U.S. commercial revenue nearly doubled, reflecting the broader AI wave, while CEO Alex Karp described the results as a "truly anomalous quarter." Despite the strong performance, some analysts remain cautious, citing the stock's high valuation relative to its earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial technology CEO argues in an op-ed that artificial intelligence is set to fundamentally transform the wealth management industry, leading to the "RIA of 1"—a single advisor augmented by AI agents. The author predicts that AI will handle most operational tasks, from client onboarding to portfolio management and regulatory reporting, allowing human advisors to focus on high-level strategy. This paradigm shift in productivity will not only improve the quality and personalization of advice but also democratize access by lowering costs, making financial planning available to a much broader audience. This increased efficiency challenges predictions of an impending advisor shortage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent comments have intensified speculation about who will replace Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve chair, with prediction markets elevating the chances for Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both men, referring to them as "both Kevins," while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention. Following the remarks, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave Hassett and Warsh each a 35% chance of being nominated. The potential appointments are significant as both candidates have previously advocated for lower interest rates, aligning with Trump's criticism of the current Fed policy.

          <p>A new FBI report reveals that crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime, including murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, fell by an estimated 4.5% compared to the previous year, with the murder rate dropping to 5 per 100,000 people. Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decrease, which included a record 18.6% one-year drop in motor vehicle thefts. While experts credit various factors, the report notes that a violent crime still occurred every 26 seconds on average last year.</p>

          <p>Austin Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect accused of killing four family members in Tennessee, was captured on Tuesday, ending a weeklong manhunt. The investigation began after an infant was found abandoned in a car seat, which led authorities to discover the bodies of the child's mother, uncle, grandmother, and the mother's partner. Drummond, who was reportedly dating a close relative of the victims, now faces four counts of first-degree murder. The search involved a reward of up to $32,500, and authorities had warned that the suspect was armed and dangerous.</p>
