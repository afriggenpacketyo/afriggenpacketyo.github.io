          <p>A Kyodo News poll indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, succeeding his predecessor who was dismissed for insensitive remarks about receiving gifted rice. The survey also reveals that 44.7% of respondents believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kilograms, a target lower than Prime Minister Ishiba's pledge. Additionally, 42.2% felt that the removal of the previous farm minister should have occurred sooner. The approval rating for Ishiba's Cabinet saw a slight increase in the poll.

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba committed to enhancing the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. Speaking at a roundtable with young SDF members in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to appropriately valuing their service, given the inherent risks. This announcement follows the enactment of revised legislation providing new allowances for SDF members, a measure aimed at addressing a recruitment shortage. The SDF's public image has been tarnished by recent scandals, even as the government seeks to bolster defense capabilities. The optimism score reflects the author's tone about the topic.</p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham is urging the public not to be overly concerned after West Nile virus was detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire. Prof Jonathan Ball believes climate change will likely increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases further north, but stresses that the risk to the general public remains low. The best way to avoid the virus is to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide. The optimism score reflects the author's tone about the topic.</p>
