          <p>A preliminary magnitude 4.1 earthquake struck parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina, with the epicenter located approximately 13 miles from Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling tremors, although there were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is known for its activity, with similar tremors occurring in the region in 2018. Gabriela Reilly in Braselton, Georgia, described her house shaking for about 10 seconds, initially mistaking it for a low-flying aircraft. The USGS initially reported the earthquake as a 3.5 magnitude quake before increasing it to 4.1.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending escalating tensions that arose following an April attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. The agreement was mediated by the United States, with President Trump announcing the breakthrough on social media and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming the U.S.'s role in brokering the ceasefire. Earlier, Indian officials had accused Pakistan of attacking multiple locations and moving troops into forward areas, while Pakistan denied involvement in the April attack. The ceasefire aims to de-escalate the conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbors, with both countries expressing a commitment to non-escalation if reciprocated.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered military leaders to review and remove books related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and "gender ideology" from their libraries, deeming them incompatible with the department's core mission.

The US Naval Academy had already removed nearly 400 books, including works by Maya Angelou and other writers of color.
