          <p>China is focusing on developing what it terms "future industries" to create a new economic growth model based on technological innovation. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this strategy targets emerging sectors with high potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, and brain-computer interfaces. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to steer development in these advanced fields. This push is a central part of China's strategy to upgrade its industrial capabilities and compete in the global technology race.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several start-ups, including London-based Better Dairy, are on the verge of bringing lab-grown cheese to consumers, using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk. These companies aim to replicate the taste and texture of traditional cheese without using animals, targeting a market currently dominated by plant-based alternatives that have seen declining sales. Despite the technological advancements, challenges remain, including high initial costs, regulatory hurdles, and consumer perceptions about ultra-processed foods. The success of this new product will depend on whether it can overcome these obstacles and win over both vegans and traditional cheese lovers.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, Jess Basey-Fisher, has met her long-lost brother for the first time after learning of his existence following their mother's death. Her father revealed that her mother had given a baby boy up for adoption years before they met. After a determined search, she located her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, in Australia, discovering remarkable parallels in their upbringings as both were raised by a doctor and a nurse. Tragically, shortly after they connected, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to spend precious time with him.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show 'Love Island' is experiencing a revival in viewership, largely attributed to its massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While traditional broadcast audience numbers are recovering from previous lows, the show's online following has exploded, with short-form clips, recaps, and commentary reaching millions. This shift in consumption habits allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to watching the full hour-long daily episodes. However, some, including a former contestant, warn that consuming the show through curated clips can lead to a distorted perception of the contestants and events.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from indiscriminately arresting individuals based on suspected immigration status. The ruling bars officials from making arrests based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish, and also prohibits them from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The lawsuit was filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were unlawfully detained during 'roving patrols.' This decision represents a significant legal check on the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, particularly in California.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and end a seven-game losing streak.

Although he is still on a limited workload, his dominant start set a positive tone for the team, which had been in a significant slump. The performance underscores Ohtani's crucial dual-threat value to the Dodgers as both a pitcher and a hitter.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as a factor contributing to China's declining birth rate, as it offers alternatives to traditional human roles in companionship and elderly care. Many young Chinese adults, facing high costs of raising a family, see AI-powered robots and companions as viable future support systems, reducing the perceived need for marriage and children. While this trend could exacerbate demographic challenges, some experts argue it may not be entirely negative. They suggest the AI revolution could fundamentally redefine concepts of life and family, making traditional population concerns less relevant in a technologically advanced future.</p>

While the tournament successfully brought top global clubs to a U.S. stage, its execution has been criticized for issues like high ticket prices and poor scheduling that led to games in extreme heat. The event has also highlighted the cozy relationship between FIFA President Gianni Infantino and President Trump. Despite the flaws, the competition provides a crucial learning opportunity for organizers and showcases the growing American market for the sport.</p>

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to protect consumers with allergies. The current system uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based scientific names that are unfamiliar to most people. This practice makes it difficult for individuals with severe allergies, such as nut allergies, to identify potentially life-threatening ingredients. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global consistency, critics argue it puts people at unnecessary risk and should be updated to match the clarity of food allergen labeling.</p>

          <p>The third day of the Test match between England and India at Lord's ended in a tense confrontation over delay tactics. England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the game to ensure he and his partner would only face one over before the close of play, angering Indian players. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed India's complaints, pointing out that Indian captain Shubman Gill had engaged in his own time-wasting by receiving a massage on the field earlier in the match. The incident added a layer of drama to the tightly contested match.</p>
