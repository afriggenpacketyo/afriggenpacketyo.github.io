          <p>CATL, the world's leading EV battery manufacturer, is diversifying its business to become a major technology provider in China's green energy sector. The company has established CharGo to develop mobile EV charging robots, addressing the lack of charging infrastructure. CharGo aims to deploy thousands of these robots globally, targeting markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. CATL's expansion comes as it prepares for a significant IPO in Hong Kong, using the funds to further develop its clean technology offerings and reduce reliance on its core battery business.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election amid heightened security concerns due to the war in Ukraine and worries about the U.S. commitment to European security. The two leading candidates are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, a liberal allied with the Prime Minister, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative supported by the Law and Justice party. The election is also a test of the strength of the far-right, with S≈Çawomir Mentzen polling in third place. The outcome could significantly impact Poland's domestic and foreign policy, particularly regarding judicial reforms and relations with the European Union.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, a move seen as a solution to African governments' debt concerns. Examples include Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. During Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought PPP funding to extend the country‚Äôs Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Uganda.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fiber-optic gyroscope with improved stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope could provide a more reliable way to measure orientation and turning rates without relying on external signals, offering immunity to interference. This technology is particularly important for military and security applications. The device, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, may improve the accuracy of inertial navigation systems.</p>
