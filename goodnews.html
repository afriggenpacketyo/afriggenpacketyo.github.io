          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is preparing for a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with changes expected to affect about half a dozen roles. Former leadership contender Sir James Cleverly is anticipated to make a prominent return to the front bench to challenge the current Labour government. The move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period marked by poor polling numbers and local election losses for the Conservatives. A party source indicated the reshuffle aims to advance the party's policy renewal and demonstrate unity under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced a plan to invest $50 billion in its United States operations by 2030, aiming to bolster manufacturing and research and development. A key part of this commitment is a new facility in Virginia dedicated to producing its weight management and metabolic drugs, including an oral GLP-1 pill. This move follows similar announcements from other major pharma companies and comes as the industry navigates potential U.S. trade tariffs and pressure to reshore manufacturing. AstraZeneca anticipates half of its projected $80 billion in annual revenue will come from the U.S. by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The small village of Ulefoss in southern Norway is located atop the Fen complex, the largest known deposit of rare earth elements in Europe. These metals are vital for modern technologies like electric vehicles and defense systems, and the EU is eager to secure a domestic supply to reduce its dependency on China. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to develop an "invisible mine" by tunneling into the deposit from a distance to minimize disruption to the village. If successful, the project could be a game-changer for European supply chain security, with full-scale operations planned for 2030.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, launched by the Alibaba-backed Chinese startup Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in popularity since its release. The large language model (LLM) is notable for its cost-efficient architecture, known as mixture-of-experts (MOE), which significantly reduces computation costs while enabling faster performance. Experts have praised this approach as a potential turning point in AI development, contrasting with the massive resource investments of competitors like OpenAI. Available for free, Kimi K2's downloads doubled in just a few days, signaling strong user interest in the domestic AI market.</p>

          <p>Italy's national women's football team has reached the semi-finals of a major tournament for the first time in 28 years and is set to face defending champions England at Euro 2025. Led by captain and top scorer Cristiana Girelli, the team has demonstrated tactical flexibility and confidence under coach Andrea Soncin. Analysts note Italy's strength in wide areas and the potential to exploit England's defensive vulnerabilities, particularly at left-back. Having not beaten England since 2012, Italy's performance in the tournament reflects the growing professionalism and investment in the country's domestic women's league.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, has announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year. In an interview, Soon-Shiong stated the move would allow for the "democratization" of the paper by enabling public ownership, though specific details of the financial arrangement were not provided. He purchased the L.A. Times in 2018, returning it to local control after years of ownership by a Chicago-based company. The decision comes as The Times, like much of the news industry, continues to navigate significant financial challenges.</p>

Following the announcement, shares of state-owned developers like Power Construction Corporation of China and other hydro equipment and cement firms saw significant gains. The project's location on a river that flows into India and Bangladesh raises potential geopolitical implications for downstream water resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota renewing their push for commercialization. Often called the "holy grail" for EVs, these batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging than current lithium-ion technology. Many key players are now targeting 2027-2028 for mass production, often starting with semi-solid-state versions as a bridge technology. However, challenges remain, including high production costs and competition from rapidly improving conventional battery technologies, leading some analysts to remain skeptical about their near-term viability.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, writer Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations faced by authors from the Balkans in the Western literary market. She argues that US and UK publishers often prioritize stories that focus on the region's historical trauma, political turmoil, and cultural exoticism, effectively requiring Balkan writers to perform a specific narrative of tragedy to be published in English. Schnabl contends that this expectation overlooks a diverse range of contemporary stories and universal human experiences from the region that do not fit into a preconceived "problematic" or "traumatic" mold. The article calls for a broader appreciation of Balkan literature beyond these stereotypes.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected an estimated 30,000 people in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. The changes come after a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." A key change ensures that if a family member with a claim dies, their payment can now be passed on through their estate. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the announcement, they expressed disappointment that some issues remain subject to further consultation.</p>
