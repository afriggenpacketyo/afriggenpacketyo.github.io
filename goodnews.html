          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are co-chairing a Franco-German Ministerial Council in Toulon, marking the first such meeting since Germany's recent government change. Ten ministers from each country are participating, with discussions centered on critical economic and security policies. Both leaders underscored the vital role of their partnership as an "axis" for a stronger European future, aiming to align policies on EU affairs, defense, economy, and foreign relations. This significant gathering occurs against the backdrop of a political crisis in France, where Prime Minister Francois Bayrou faces a potential confidence vote.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed low-value imports under $800 to bypass tariffs, has officially concluded. President Trump enacted this change to close a perceived "catastrophic loophole" that allegedly facilitated tariff evasion and the entry of dangerous goods, including narcotics. This policy shift, initially targeting shipments from China and Hong Kong, now applies globally, with the administration expecting to generate up to $10 billion in annual tariff revenues. A six-month transition period is in place, during which postal services can opt for a flat duty per package, before full ad valorem duty collection based on shipment value becomes mandatory by February 2026.</p>

Upcoming price rise reports from France, Spain, Italy, and Germany will precede the euro area's flash August inflation reading. Stateside, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a vital measure for the Federal Reserve, is under scrutiny, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks hinted at a potential September interest rate cut.

          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully unveiled and tested a novel vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) drone, whose unique form bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic "Gimbal" unidentified flying object previously observed by U.S. Navy pilots in 2015. This experimental aircraft incorporates a radical aerodynamic design, featuring an elliptical, ring-like wing that seamlessly integrates a straight central section to create a closed-loop structure. Four rotors, positioned at the junctions of the wings and vertical stabilizers, provide both lift and structural support. This innovative design marks a significant advancement in aerospace technology, promising improved endurance, stability, and versatility for uncrewed flight missions.</p>

          <p>Starting next January, all young children in England and Wales will receive a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months of age, alongside the existing MMR jab. A catch-up program is also planned for slightly older children to ensure comprehensive coverage. This public health initiative aims to safeguard youngsters from severe, albeit rare, complications of the varicella virus, and is also expected to alleviate the economic burden on parents from time off work. Health experts anticipate that widespread vaccination will significantly reduce overall chickenpox cases and the incidence of serious illness.</p>

          <p>Football icon Wayne Rooney recounted a surprising phone call from Paul Scholes that initiated his move to Manchester United while he was still a teenager at Everton. During an episode of his podcast, Rooney revealed Scholes' direct query about joining the club. He explained that Sir Alex Ferguson initially wanted to wait, but United accelerated their efforts to prevent him from signing with Newcastle. Rooney also disclosed a close call with Chelsea, which he declined due to their plan to loan him to Middlesbrough. His deadline day transfer was so impromptu that he signed his contract wearing his wife's cousin's jumper.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit could signify a tentative improvement in the often-strained relations between the two Asian giants. Facing mutual pressure from U.S. tariffs, economic necessity might be driving a cautious move towards cooperation, despite lingering suspicions and border disputes. While experts doubt the emergence of a long-lasting friendship, the summit offers a crucial platform for dialogue, with India keen to address its significant trade deficit and secure essential raw materials from China. The article highlights India's aspiration to become a manufacturing hub, though it still relies heavily on Chinese intermediate goods.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is preparing for the inaugural test launch of its Soyuz-5 rocket in December, a project that has been a decade in the making. This medium-class launch vehicle, powered by advanced RD-171MV engines, is slated for full operational status by 2028. The endeavor is particularly notable given the significant funding challenges Roscosmos has encountered since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which resulted in the termination of its partnership with the European Space Agency. The agency plans to utilize Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome for the launch, as it works to stabilize and advance its national space program.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tariff exemption for global parcel shipments valued under $800 has officially ceased, introducing new costs and disruptions across various business supply chains. This policy, which the Trump administration has declared permanent, is intended to curb the entry of illicit goods, including fentanyl, and is projected to add up to $10 billion annually to the U.S. Treasury. A six-month transition period is now in effect, allowing foreign postal services to opt for a flat duty ranging from $80 to $200 per package, based on the country of origin's tariff rates. However, by February 28, 2026, all shipments will be subject to full "ad valorem" duty collection.</p>
