          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to address protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, citing the move as "illegal." The judge, Charles Breyer, ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, asserting that Trump exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. Newsom expressed gratification with the ruling, stating the National Guard would be redeployed to border security, counter-drug enforcement, and forest management, reversing Trump's changes. The judge emphasized protesters' First Amendment rights and found the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion."</p>

          <p>Seven Democratic candidates vying for mayor of New York City engaged in a combative debate, with former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist assemblymember Zohran Mamdani as the frontrunners. Cuomo, attempting a political comeback, criticized Mamdani's inexperience, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo's record, including his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations. The candidates discussed issues such as immigration, housing, and public safety, with Cuomo defending New York City's status as a sanctuary city and Mamdani pledging to block NYPD cooperation with federal immigration agents. The debate also featured accusations of Islamophobia and criticisms of Cuomo's past actions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Donald Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles, ordering the troops to return to the control of Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" in Los Angeles and did not comply with the required procedural steps. Newsom hailed the court's decision as a victory for all Americans, asserting that Trump's actions threatened democracy and approached authoritarianism. The ruling comes after a hearing where the Justice Department argued Trump had the sole power to decide whether federal intervention was necessary.</p>

          <p>A federal judge deemed President Donald Trump's federalizing of California National Guard troops and deploying them to Los Angeles as "illegal" and ordered him to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed the order until Friday afternoon to allow the Trump administration to appeal. Trump had federalized 4,000 National Guard members and mobilized 700 U.S. Marines to respond to protests against federal immigration enforcement. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's action, which was the first time a president had taken such an action without the governor's consent.</p>

          <p>China's rapid development of infrastructure, from subway systems to high-speed rail, has transformed the nation into an "engineering state," according to Dan Wang. The country's focus on building large-scale public works, including dams, bridges, and high-rises, has surpassed that of other nations. China's emphasis on STEM education has led to a significantly higher number of STEM graduates compared to the United States, where lawyers often dominate top official positions. This engineering-focused approach is considered a matter of national security and priority, driving China's advancements in various technological fields.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against President Trump's use of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president erred in activating the guard. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Gov. Gavin Newsom by Friday afternoon. The ruling is a setback for the White House in the dispute over its powers to crack down on immigration. Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts do not have authority to review a president's decision on whether the National Guard is needed.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research conducted by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region and found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. These findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed carded an albatross, one of golf's rarest scores, during the first round of the US Open. Reed hit a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole, resulting in a double-eagle. This marks only the fourth albatross at the US Open since record-keeping began in 1983. Despite the exceptional score, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, concluding with a triple bogey on the final hole. This remarkable feat places him in the company of only a few golfers who have achieved this rare score in US Open history.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion to ensure their long-term survival amid ongoing trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite a temporary truce, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs of up to 3,521%. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned overseas capacity expansion. Localizing production abroad is seen as essential for navigating trade tensions and sustaining competitiveness in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>
