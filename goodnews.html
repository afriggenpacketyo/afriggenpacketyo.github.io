        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, with its liberal majority, has struck down a 176-year-old abortion ban, providing greater legal certainty for abortion access in the state. In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that the 1849 law was superseded by a 1985 statute that permits abortions until fetal viability. The ruling affirms a lower court's decision and resolves the legal ambiguity that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. This decision solidifies the legality of abortions that had resumed in the state following the initial 2023 circuit court ruling.</p>

          <p>During a hospital visit in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke candidly about the long-term challenges of recovering from chemotherapy. She described how patients often put on a brave face during treatment, only to find the post-treatment phase unexpectedly difficult as they are no longer under constant clinical care but cannot function as they once did. The princess emphasized that recovering from cancer is a life-changing experience for both patients and their families, requiring time to find a "new normal" and acknowledging that the process is a rollercoaster rather than a smooth journey.</p>

          <p>The FBI has announced it will relocate its headquarters to the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., ending a nearly two-decade search for a new permanent location. The move keeps the bureau in downtown D.C., a decision favored by President Trump, and scraps a previous plan to move to a new campus in Maryland. FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move is the most cost-effective option and provides a safer workplace than the deteriorating J. Edgar Hoover building. However, Maryland lawmakers have vowed to fight the decision, arguing it ignores security threats and congressional intent.</p>

China's share of global capacity is projected to grow from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan currently leads with a 23% share. This progress highlights the success of Beijing's strategic push for chip self-sufficiency, even amidst ongoing technological restrictions from the United States.

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates has spurred a 7% weekly increase in applications to refinance home loans, which are now 40% higher than a year ago. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, its lowest level since April, prompting homeowners to seek savings. In contrast, applications for mortgages to purchase a home remained nearly flat, increasing by only 0.1% for the week. This suggests that while current homeowners are sensitive to rate changes, prospective homebuyers remain hesitant due to overall market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
