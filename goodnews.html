          <p>A 4.1 magnitude earthquake shook parts of Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina on Saturday morning, with the epicenter located near Greenback, Tennessee. Residents in Atlanta and western North Carolina reported feeling tremors, and the USGS received over 23,000 public reports within the first hour. While no significant damage or injuries were immediately reported, the event served as a reminder of the region's seismic activity, as the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone is one of the most active in the Southeast. The article notes that there is a small chance of aftershocks in the coming week and also provides some context for the geologic activity of the region.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home HPV screening test for cervical cancer, offering an alternative to traditional Pap smears. The Teal Wand allows women to collect a sample at home and mail it for laboratory analysis, potentially increasing screening rates. A clinical trial showed a 96% accuracy rate in detecting cervical precancers, with most participants preferring the at-home option. The test detects human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes almost all cervical cancer cases.

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller emphasizes the importance of instinct over data in making creative and business decisions. Diller argues that too much information can hinder understanding and that simple human instinct is essential for evaluating ideas. He recalls his experiences with ABC's "Movie of the Week" and the success of films like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," which were based on instinctual judgments rather than extensive research. The article highlights Diller's belief in the limitations of relying solely on data and the value of common sense.</p>
