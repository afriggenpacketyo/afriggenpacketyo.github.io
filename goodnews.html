          <p>President Donald Trump has officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, expressed gratitude for the pardon, noting that Trump had personally informed her of his decision. The Chrisleys were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution for charges stemming from a fifteen-year fraud spree. The family's story will continue with a new reality series on Lifetime, and the Chrisleys are expected to reunite soon after being separated in prison.</p>

          <p>President Trump has responded to the term "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out), an acronym coined by a Financial Times journalist to describe his pattern of announcing tariffs, causing market drops, and then easing them, leading to market rebounds. When asked about the term, Trump dismissed it as a "nasty question" and asserted that his actions are part of a negotiation strategy. He claimed that the threat of tariffs has prompted trade talks with the European Union, defending his approach as a way to gain ground in trade negotiations. Despite market fluctuations, some analysts suggest investors are becoming more comfortable with Trump's tariff tactics.</p>

Deonte Nash, Combs' stylist, confirmed the birth during court testimony.
