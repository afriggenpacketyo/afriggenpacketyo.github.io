          <p>Sovereignty, with 5-1 odds, won the 151st Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, triumphing over 18 other horses in rainy conditions.

          <p>Buffalo Trace Distillery, America's oldest-running distillery, reopened in Frankfort, Kentucky, just in time for the Kentucky Derby after being shut down due to historic flooding.

Despite the extensive damage, crews worked quickly to restore operations for Derby Week, an important time for bourbon sales.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the complexities of antidepressant use, noting that while they can be life-saving for some, others experience significant side effects and withdrawal symptoms. The author, a psychiatrist, argues for more research into the long-term effects and safe tapering strategies for antidepressants, as current guidelines are lacking. The piece highlights the need for the medical community to acknowledge and address patients' concerns about these medications, rather than dismissing them with a blanket statement of "safe and effective." The author warns that ignoring patient experiences risks losing credibility and ceding the conversation to those who may exploit suffering for personal gain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave" and Oscar-winning film adaptation, likened the process of selecting a new Pope to the dynamics of the TV show "The Traitors," where contestants must identify the "traitors" among them. Harris suggests that the secretive ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right leader. He also finds it odd that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope. Harris was given permission to visit parts of the Vatican generally off-limits to outsiders while researching his novel about conclave.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the Reform Party's success in the recent English local council elections, highlighting that their victory was more than just a protest vote. The party performed well in wards that heavily voted for Brexit in 2016 and for Boris Johnson in 2019, indicating a concentrated appeal among those who feel left behind by globalization and hold more conservative views on immigration. This presents a challenge for both the Conservative and Labour parties, as they need to appeal to this demographic to recover from their losses. Reform's success reflects a mood of disillusionment with both major parties in a distinctive segment of the British population.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, with higher amounts for students with disabilities and smaller amounts for home-schooled students. Supporters claim the bill empowers parents, while Democrats argue it harms public schools and primarily benefits wealthier students.
