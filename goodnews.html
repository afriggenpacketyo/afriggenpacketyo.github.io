          <h2>New Performance Rankings for NHS Trusts in England Released</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 05:31:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, the UK government has published league tables ranking the performance of NHS trusts across England, with specialist hospitals like Moorfields Eye Hospital securing the top positions. The rankings evaluate trusts on seven criteria, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial health, sorting them into four performance segments. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables would enhance public transparency and accountability, but organizations representing the trusts have raised concerns about the metrics used. They worry that the significant weight given to financial status could misrepresent the quality of patient care and lead trusts to prioritize metrics over patient needs.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is expected to appoint Ange Postecoglou as their new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham despite leading them to a Europa League victory, is reportedly in advanced discussions with the club. Nuno's tenure ended after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having guided Forest to their highest league finish in decades last season. If appointed, Postecoglou would be the eighth permanent manager under owner Evangelos Marinakis, tasked with building on the team's current 10th-place standing in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a reform that makes most Americans eligible to purchase affordable "copper plans" on the Obamacare exchanges. Previously, these plans, which feature lower premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs, were restricted to individuals under 30 or those granted a rare hardship exemption. The new rule effectively expands this exemption to a much wider population, a move the administration claims will save families thousands annually and encourage uninsured individuals to get coverage. Proponents argue this will help stabilize the Obamacare markets by attracting younger, healthier enrollees and reduce uncompensated care costs for hospitals.</p>

Candidates face a tight deadline to secure the necessary 80 nominations from fellow MPs to proceed. Phillipson is positioning herself as a unifier ready to combat the threat from the Reform party, while Ribeiro-Addy represents a more critical voice from the party's left flank.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. court has ruled against breaking up Google, in part because the recent explosion of generative AI has fundamentally altered the search market landscape. Judge Amit Mehta, who previously found Google had illegally monopolized search, decided against forcing the sale of its Chrome browser, citing AI as a potential "game changer." The judge's opinion noted that the rapid emergence of AI chatbots from competitors like OpenAI and Microsoft presents a significant new competitive threat to Google's dominance. This shift in the tech landscape, which occurred during the trial, was deemed a profound factor in shaping the final, less severe penalty.</p>

          <p>The long-running succession dispute within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies his son Lachlan's control over Fox News and News Corp. The deal restructures the family trust, ensuring Lachlan will lead the companies while his more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with company shares. In exchange, they are expected to receive approximately $1.1 billion each, effectively ending their influence over the media conglomerate's conservative direction. This resolution finalizes the real-life drama that inspired the TV show "Succession" and ensures the continuity of the empire's editorial stance.</p>
