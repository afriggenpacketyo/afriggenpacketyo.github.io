          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 03:09:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, an increase of over £500 annually for many recipients. This adjustment is based on the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees pensions increase by the highest of inflation, average earnings growth, or 2.5%. The likely figure comes from the latest wage data, potentially pushing the new flat-rate pension to over £12,500 a year. However, experts warn that with the personal tax allowance frozen, this rise will pull more pensioners into paying income tax in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom is positioned as a welcome diversion for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is facing numerous domestic challenges. These issues include the resignation of a key ally, mass protests over immigration, and internal party dissent. The visit, filled with royal pageantry, is expected to appeal to Trump's sensibilities and reinforce the "special relationship." A key focus will be on securing new trade and investment deals, including partnerships in technology, AI, and nuclear energy, providing Starmer with much-needed positive news amid his government's low approval ratings.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic Monday Night Football game, quarterback Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans with a game-winning touchdown drive in the final seconds. Mayfield's late-game heroics, including a crucial fourth-down scramble, secured a 2-0 start for the Buccaneers. In the night's other game, the Los Angeles Chargers' defense dominated the Las Vegas Raiders in a 20-9 win. The Chargers' defense secured three interceptions, setting the tone from the first play and holding the Raiders to just 218 total yards, giving coach Jim Harbaugh a victory over his rival, Pete Carroll.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill designed to prevent cover-ups following major disasters. The legislation will create a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials and bodies to cooperate truthfully with investigations or face criminal sanctions. The bill, long campaigned for by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, also aims to provide legal funding for those affected by state-related tragedies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law would change the "balance of power" and learn lessons from other scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon case.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly using apps and data analysis to track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of overall health and a key factor in athletic performance. This monitoring allows for tailored adjustments to training, nutrition, and recovery to mitigate symptoms like cramps and fatigue. Teams like England's Red Roses use wellness forms and ovulation tests, while others employ specialized apps to collect data on players' physical and mental wellbeing. The goal is not to sideline players, but to make informed adaptations that help athletes perform at their peak throughout their cycle.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to debate and vote on a significant justice reform bill that includes eliminating the controversial "not proven" verdict from criminal trials. This verdict, unique to Scots law, results in an acquittal but is criticized for causing confusion and stigma. To balance this change, the reforms also propose raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The comprehensive bill also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and the creation of a new victims and witnesses commissioner to improve their experience within the justice system.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of developing a unified national market to enhance China's international competitiveness and achieve its development targets. In an article published in the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Qiushi, he outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and damaging price competition among domestic firms. Xi urged industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over simply offering the lowest price. This directive aligns with a previous government call to eliminate obsolete industrial capacity and crack down on unhealthy market practices to foster more sustainable economic growth.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, leading to some surprising results. Participants, who were accustomed to spending hours on phones and gaming consoles in their rooms, reported sleeping better and feeling more rested for school. The experiment also pushed them to engage in other activities; one student spent evenings baking and researching ballet lessons, while another spent more time with his family in communal areas. The project, part of a BBC initiative, highlights the impact of technology on adolescent sleep patterns and family interaction, prompting discussions about setting healthy boundaries.</p>

          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly among a group of companies involved in a framework deal between the U.S. and China that would allow TikTok to continue its operations in the United States. While the precise structure remains unclear, sources indicate a multi-company solution has been agreed upon in commercial terms, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the details. The deal aims to resolve long-standing U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, and its access to American user data. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are primarily planning to use Shohei Ohtani as a starting pitcher in the upcoming playoffs, but the team has not ruled out deploying him from the bullpen in certain high-leverage situations. Andrew Friedman, the president of baseball operations, acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could necessitate such a move, similar to how Walker Buehler was used in the past. While Ohtani's role is set as a starter, manager Dave Roberts has kept the conversation open. However, using Ohtani in relief is complicated by MLB's two-way player rule, which would force the Dodgers to lose him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound.</p>
