          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the previous government's collapse, Nepal has sworn in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. Her appointment, negotiated between the army, the president, and youth protest representatives, has brought a sense of calm to the capital, Kathmandu. In her first moves, Karki recommended and the president approved the dissolution of parliament and set new elections for March 5, aiming to address the economic woes and governance issues that fueled the widespread "GenZ" demonstrations.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address both declining birth rates and a need to retain scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees who are returning to work after childbirth. Initially targeting 20 researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to ease the transition back into demanding scientific careers. While its initial scope is limited, the policy is seen by some as a positive step toward creating a more supportive environment for women in science.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo began with athletes facing grueling conditions, as temperatures climbed to 30°C with over 90% humidity. The challenging weather was a dominant theme on the first day, with race walk events moved earlier to mitigate risks, though many competitors still struggled. For the host nation, the event marked a poignant moment as Japan secured its first medal, allowing local fans to celebrate in the stadium—an experience denied during the spectator-free 2020 Olympics. With a heatwave forecast, concerns for athlete safety remain a primary focus for the remainder of the nine-day competition.</p>

However, the Huskies rallied in the final quarter, capitalizing on Mater Dei's five fumbles and two interceptions to secure the historic victory.

          <p>Apple's latest iPhone 17 series has seen exceptionally strong pre-order demand in China, with initial sales on the e-commerce platform JD.com surpassing the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16. The high demand caused technical difficulties on Apple's official website, and in-store pickup slots in major cities like Shanghai were fully booked within twenty minutes. Despite some shipment delays for certain models, the record-breaking start indicates robust consumer interest in Apple's new offerings within the crucial Chinese market. Customers in some regions are now facing wait times extending into mid-October for their new devices. (not investment advice)</p>

While acknowledging the need for Europe to build economic resilience, the minister stated that protectionism is not the solution and that Bavaria values its close economic ties with China. This stance highlights a regional desire to maintain strong business relationships, even as the broader geopolitical landscape between Europe and China becomes more complex. The statement underscores the economic pragmatism that often exists at the sub-national level in Germany. (not investment advice)</p>
