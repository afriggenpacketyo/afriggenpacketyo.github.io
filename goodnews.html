          <p>The U.S. State Department has provided information and support to over 25,000 people seeking guidance regarding the security situation in Israel, the West Bank, and Iran.

The State Department is not anticipating offering direct U.S. government-assisted departure from Iran, and as of now, there are no reports of injuries sustained by American citizens during the conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release on bail for Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil, who was arrested by ICE in March. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was detained under two charges, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoking a rarely-used portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The judge ruled Rubio's justification unconstitutional and expressed skepticism about the government's requests to keep Khalil detained. Khalil's attorneys argued that the government is violating his free speech rights, and under the conditions of his release, he would not have to wear electronic monitoring.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with the first driverless trip from the factory to a customer house expected on June 28. The initial rides will be in the Model Y, with access by invitation only and a Tesla Safety Monitor sitting in the front passenger seat. Trips will be limited to a geofenced area of the city, and remote drivers will be monitoring as a backup. Musk has long touted a driverless robotaxi, and analysts believe it could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, though Tesla is trying to catch up to competitors like Waymo in the autonomous driving space.</p>

This announcement coincided with a federal judge granting a preliminary injunction that would continue blocking the president's efforts to bar international students from attending Harvard University. The Trump administration has taken actions against Harvard's international students, including disqualifying them from receiving visas, citing the university's alleged failure to account for "known illegal activity" by students.</p>

          <p>Circle's shares extended their rally following the Senate's approval of its proposed stablecoin legislation, the GENIUS Act.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, and are benefiting from increased interest by banks and payment firms. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a regulatory framework for the use of stablecoins, potentially making payments faster and cheaper. (not investment advice)</p>
