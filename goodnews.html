          <p>England's rugby team has claimed a 2-0 series victory against Argentina following a dramatic 22-17 win in San Juan. The match remained tied for most of the second half until a last-minute try from replacement Jack van Poortvliet secured the win for the visitors. Tries from Seb Atkinson and Freddie Steward in the first half had given England an early advantage before Argentina fought back to take a narrow lead. This victory marks England's sixth consecutive Test win and their tenth in Argentina, concluding their tour with a clean sweep.</p>

          <h2>Expert Suggests AI's Role in China's Population Decline May Not Be Entirely Negative</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence is being partly blamed for exacerbating China's declining population by reducing traditional incentives for marriage and childbirth, as it can fulfill roles like emotional companionship and elderly care. However, a leading demography expert argues this technological shift might not be negative, suggesting the AI revolution could redefine family structures and make traditional population concerns obsolete. Many young Chinese citizens, like 32-year-old Tracy Li, are embracing a single lifestyle, confident that future advancements in AI and robotics will provide the necessary support in old age, thereby lessening the societal pressure to have children.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor secured a definitive victory over Puerto Rico's Amanda Serrano, winning their third fight by majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The judges scored the contest 97-93 twice for Taylor and 95-95, allowing her to retain her undisputed super lightweight world titles. This bout concluded a trilogy that began in 2022, with Taylor winning all three encounters. Unlike the previous two fights which had controversial outcomes, this third meeting was marked by a clear and pronounced dominance from the 39-year-old Irish champion over her 36-year-old rival in front of nearly 20,000 fans.</p>

          <p>The final of the FIFA Club World Cup, set to be held in New York, is being viewed as a significant indicator of soccer's cultural and commercial standing in the United States. The tournament's success and the high-profile nature of the final, which former President Trump is expected to attend, provide a major platform for the sport ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host. According to Paul Tenorio of The Athletic, this event serves as a crucial barometer for measuring the progress of soccer's integration into the mainstream American sports landscape and its potential for future financial growth.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has spoken about being overwhelmed by nerves during her first Grand Slam final, where she suffered a 6-0, 6-0 defeat to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon. The 23-year-old described herself as feeling "a bit frozen" by the occasion, which contributed to a high number of unforced errors. Despite the lopsided loss, Anisimova is taking the match as a valuable learning experience and was comforted by kind words from the Princess of Wales after the match. She acknowledged that fatigue from recent weeks may have played a role but aims to emerge stronger from the demoralizing defeat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dispute over game tactics has emerged in the third Test between England and India at Lord's, with both sides accusing each other of time-wasting. The issue came to a head when England opener Zak Crawley repeatedly delayed the final overs of day three, angering Indian players. However, England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, defended the actions, pointing out that India's captain Shubman Gill had received a lengthy massage on the field the previous day, also causing a stoppage. The dramatic and tense finish to the day's play highlights the high stakes and competitive nature of the ongoing series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has discreetly pushed back against criticism from the Trump administration regarding its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. The central bank updated its website with an FAQ page to defend the project, directly addressing claims made by OMB Director Russell Vought, who called the overhaul "ostentatious." The Fed clarified that the project modernizes historic buildings and denied the construction of new VIP dining rooms, explaining that cost increases were due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos. This response comes as the administration intensifies its campaign against Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the Wimbledon final marked a surprising but significant milestone in her career, as she conquered a surface on which she had previously struggled. Known as the 'Queen of Clay,' Swiatek's first grass-court title was the result of focused improvements to her game, particularly her movement and serve, under new coach Wim Fissette. After a dip in form over the past year, she entered the tournament with less pressure, allowing her to play more freely. This win makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces.</p>

The RAF has launched an investigation into the incident. This aircraft is one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world.</p>
