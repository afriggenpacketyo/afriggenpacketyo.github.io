          <p>Just 11 days after her mother and younger sister died in a plane crash near Washington D.C., 14-year-old pianist A.V. Ter won a major competition. She performed a piece that her mother had particularly loved and dreamed of her playing with an orchestra. Despite the profound loss and the difficulty of traveling past the crash site to the venue, Ter felt compelled to play in their memory. Her victory provided a moment of normalcy and pride for her grieving family.</p>

          <p>Three seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for an interim payment of £500,000 in damages. They allege that the hall's operator has unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted by the rules governing their ownership rights. The seat holders, who own private seats in the historic venue, are seeking a declaration that this practice is illegal. A judge dismissed their request for an immediate ruling and payment, stating that the complex dispute must proceed to a full trial.</p>

          <p>Amidst lackluster sales, Starbucks is launching a new hospitality-focused strategy called "Green Apron Service" to improve the customer experience in its cafes. The initiative, part of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan, trains baristas to provide warmer, more engaging interactions to encourage repeat visits. This focus on personal connection is supported by new technology to optimize staffing and reduce service times. The company hopes this renewed emphasis on its core coffeehouse experience will help it stand out in a competitive market and boost sales.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Scotland, First Minister John Swinney urged him to exempt scotch whisky from a 10% U.S. tariff. Swinney stated he believes there is a "window of opportunity" to address the issue, which is reportedly costing the industry £4 million per week. The two leaders held a formal meeting and sat together at a dinner at the president's Aberdeenshire resort. Trump, who was in Scotland to open a new golf course, appeared receptive, and Swinney expressed cautious optimism that progress could be made.</p>

          <p>The recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is expected to be a major windfall for large technology companies by restoring several key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation permanently brings back immediate expensing for R&D, 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, and more flexible interest deduction rules. According to analysts, these changes will significantly boost free cash flow for tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, providing more capital for AI investments and shareholder returns.

The legislation increased the amount of credits available to states and lowered financing requirements, making it more financially viable to develop low-income rental units. While challenges like high interest rates and local opposition persist, the enhanced tax credit is expected to help produce over a million additional affordable homes over the next decade.
