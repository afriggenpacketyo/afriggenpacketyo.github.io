        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is positioned as a return to form after his last two introspective records saw lower commercial success. The album attempts to blend his signature pop style with Asian and Middle Eastern musical influences, a move inspired by his recent tours. While some tracks, like "Sapphire," successfully integrate these new sounds, critics suggest that much of the album retreats to familiar, safe territory. This article notes that while the record is enjoyable for his fanbase, it ultimately feels like a missed opportunity to be more artistically adventurous and less focused on streaming algorithms.</p>

          <p>Companies are increasingly using a program called Reflection Point, which uses short story discussions to help build empathy and improve communication skills in the workplace. The initiative, described as a book club for the modern worker, aims to create common ground by allowing colleagues to share life experiences through the lens of literature. Proponents argue there is a direct link between empathy and commercial success, citing research that empathetic companies tend to outperform their peers financially. The nonprofit has worked with nearly 150 companies, with leaders reporting a "dramatic change" in team dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service is looking to Denmark's healthcare model for insights on improving cancer survival rates. Over the past 25 years, Denmark transformed its cancer care through significant, sustained investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and fostering political consensus. This approach has allowed Denmark to significantly surpass the UK in five-year survival rates for several cancers. While challenges exist in applying this model to the larger and more complex NHS, UK policymakers are studying its success for a new long-term cancer plan.</p>

          <h2>South Africa's Top Court Rules Men Can Legally Adopt Their Wives' Surnames</h2>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that men now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court declared the previous legislation, which only allowed women to change their names, unconstitutional as it discriminated on the basis of gender. The ruling noted that the practice of women taking their husband's surname was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect this change.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Regulators Face Challenge of Managing Stock Market Bull Run</h2>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's US$12 trillion stock market are presenting a challenge for regulators, who aim to foster a stable, sustainable bull market rather than a volatile boom-and-bust cycle. Beijing's goal is to position the equity market as a reliable source of household income to help boost consumer spending and shift wealth away from the property sector. While recent moderation in the market's ascent may be welcomed by officials to curb risky retail investor behavior, the overall uptrend is believed to be continuing. The situation tests the government's ability to guide market forces effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Original Pantry, an iconic 24-hour diner in downtown Los Angeles that closed earlier this year, is set to reopen after being acquired by real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov. The purchase was made with the support of the hospitality union Unite Here Local 11. An agreement was reached to retain the diner's union representation and rehire all 25 employees who lost their jobs when the previous owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, closed it amid a labor dispute. The reopening of the century-old establishment is being celebrated as a victory for the longtime workers.</p>

          <p>Following a day where all major stock indexes reached record highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against market "cynics," stating that he remains bullish and expects the market to continue its upward trend. He suggested that bearish investors are being overrun by positive economic events, such as softer labor market data that could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Cramer believes that despite geopolitical tensions and other national concerns, strong individual company performance and a booming IPO market will continue to drive stocks higher, forcing pessimistic money managers to change their stance.

          <p>Stock prices for both Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw significant increases following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a buyout offer for its rival. A potential deal would merge major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the Paramount film studio, marking further consolidation in an industry reshaped by streaming. The bid is being led by David Ellison, whose firm recently completed its own merger with Paramount. This potential acquisition comes as media companies face increased scrutiny from the Trump administration, adding a political dimension to the business maneuver.</p>

          <p>A review from the Toronto International Film Festival covers several potential awards contenders, including two competing docudramas about professional fighters: "The Smashing Machine" starring Dwayne Johnson and "Christy" with Sydney Sweeney. While "The Smashing Machine" is described as a conventional biopic, "Christy" is praised for Sweeney's performance as a closeted lesbian boxer in the 1990s. The article also lauds Tessa Thompson's role in "Hedda," a dynamic adaptation of Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," and Guillermo del Toro's new "Frankenstein" movie. These films are positioned as key entries in the upcoming awards season conversation.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's new striker, Yoane Wissa, has completed a £55m move from Brentford, a high point in a career marked by remarkable resilience. In 2021, just before his first Premier League move, Wissa was the victim of a home acid attack that could have ended his career and cost him his sight. His former manager recalls his immediate determination to recover and succeed, a trait that has defined his professional rise from the French second division. Despite a contentious exit from Brentford, his on-field performance and determination made him a key target for his new club.</p>
