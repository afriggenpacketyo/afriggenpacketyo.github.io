          <p>Intel shares surged by approximately 6% after President Trump announced the U.S. government's intent to acquire a 10% equity stake in the struggling chipmaker, valued at over $10 billion. This proposed deal, in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, marks a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government taking a more active role in corporate America. Although Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has not explicitly agreed, discussions are ongoing, and the White House anticipates further negotiations. This development follows a recent $2 billion investment from SoftBank, underscoring efforts to bolster Intel, the sole American company capable of producing advanced chips domestically.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled a potential for interest rate cuts, stating that the 'shifting balance of risks' due to "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies 'may warrant adjusting our policy stance.' In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell acknowledged the labor market's strength and the economy's resilience, yet highlighted increasing downside dangers and the risk of rising inflation from tariffs. While avoiding a direct commitment to a September cut, his cautious tone sent stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling, indicating market anticipation of easing monetary policy. Powell also subtly underscored the importance of the Fed's independence from political demands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ether, a prominent cryptocurrency, experienced a significant surge, trading close to its record high, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole. Powell's comments, hinting at potential interest rate cuts, caught many traders 'off-sides,' leading to approximately $120 million in short liquidations for ETH within an hour. This rapid market repositioning, driven by expectations of easing monetary policy, propelled Ether's price higher. Shares of companies specializing in ether accumulation, such as Bitmine Immersion and SharpLink Gaming, also saw substantial gains, reflecting a broader positive sentiment in the crypto market.

          <p>The federal EV tax credit, offering up to $7,500, is slated to expire on September 30, but the IRS has issued new guidance providing a crucial window of flexibility for car buyers. Under the clarification, consumers can still qualify for the credit if they enter a binding contract to purchase a vehicle and make a payment before the deadline, even if the car's delivery occurs later. This adjustment is particularly beneficial for those ordering vehicles or facing shipping delays, ensuring they don't miss the opportunity. The Trump administration's broader rollback of policies designed to promote electric vehicles makes this temporary reprieve especially noteworthy for the automotive market.

          <h2>Film Review: 'Splitsville' Fails to Deliver on Its Promise of Cutting Comedy</h2>

          <p>The new comedy 'Splitsville,' co-written, directed, and starring Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin, aims to deliver a cutting satire on modern marriage and the absurdities of male friendship but ultimately fails to meet its ambitions. The article critiques the film for its self-indulgent tone and for excessively focusing on the male leads' antics, often sidelining the stronger performances from its female co-stars, Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson. While acknowledging moments of humor, the review suggests the movie struggles to weave its jokes into a cohesive narrative with meaningful depth. The overall assessment indicates that the duo's talents might be better utilized behind the camera rather than in front of it, hindering the film's potential impact.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists, aged eight to 17, have filed a lawsuit against the state of Wisconsin, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies which they argue violate their constitutional rights and worsen climate impacts. The suit specifically targets two state laws that prohibit the public service commission from considering toxic air pollution when approving new fossil fuel power plants and from mandating increased renewable energy use. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, shared her traumatic experience of relocating due to climate-induced flooding. Supported by Our Children’s Trust, the legal action seeks to declare these laws unconstitutional, aiming to compel Wisconsin to protect its natural resources for present and future generations and foster a livable future.</p>
