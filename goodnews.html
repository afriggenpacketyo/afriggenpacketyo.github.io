          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its intent to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to broaden its consumer base, expand internationally, and secure a larger share of the Nike sneaker market. Dick's plans to operate Foot Locker as an independent unit, preserving its brands and targeting a younger, more urban demographic. While the deal faces potential anti-competition scrutiny, both companies anticipate no major regulatory obstacles, and Nike CEO Elliott Hill expressed confidence in the merger's potential to boost the sports retail industry. Foot Locker shares surged on the news, while Dick's shares dipped due to investor concerns about the merger's financial implications.</p>

          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% in the first quarter of 2025, surpassing expectations and leading the G7 in growth rate, driven by strong spending in retail, hospitality, and finance. However, economist Paul Dales suggests this may be the peak for the year, as new tariffs imposed by the US could reduce UK exports and slow economic growth. While a recent UK-US tariff deal may alleviate some pressure, its impact remains uncertain, and rising taxes and utility bills could offset any perceived economic gains for the average citizen.</p>

The statue, a replacement for a previous wooden version destroyed by arson, was reportedly cut off at the ankles and removed. The statue's creator, Brad Downey, speculates the theft may be related to Donald Trump's election but remains uncertain. The disappearance adds another layer to the statue's troubled history, which began with the original wooden carving by a local artist.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the National Association of Realtors found that only about 1 in 5 listed homes in March were affordable for households with $75,000 in annual income, down from about half of all listings before the pandemic. Rising home prices and higher mortgage rates are pushing many homes out of the price range for middle-class households, according to Nadia Evangelou, senior economist and director of real estate research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR). It's discouraging for many people now and we hear from people who are earning a good income, and still feel homeownership is out of reach.</p>

          <p>President Trump's denouncement of Western intervention and nation-building in a speech in Saudi Arabia was met with applause, reflecting long-held grievances in the Middle East. While some praised his message of sovereignty, others expressed skepticism, citing concerns about human rights and the potential for U.S. self-interest. The speech came during a visit focused on economic deals and diplomatic ambitions, including urging Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel and seeking a nuclear deal with Iran.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changing economic conditions and policy uncertainties. While longer-term inflation expectations remain near the Fed's 2% target, Powell suggested the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return, citing the potential for more frequent and persistent supply shocks. Powell's remarks reflect ongoing concerns about balancing employment and controlling inflation, particularly in light of potential impacts from tariffs and other policy changes.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is buying ailing shoe company Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, the second deal for a large U.S. footwear maker in recent weeks as the industry grapples with the impact of steep new American tariffs on their production. Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos. The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia.</p>

          <p>Scientists have solved the decades-long mystery behind the distinctive ginger color of cats, discovering that these felines are missing a section of their genetic code. The missing code causes the cells responsible for skin, eye, and fur tone to produce lighter colors, particularly in males. This breakthrough could also shed light on potential health conditions associated with orange coloring, as the gene responsible, ARHGAP36, is active in various parts of the body, including the brain and hormonal glands.</p>

          <p>The issue of "debanking," or the closure of bank accounts for politically motivated reasons, has gained traction in Washington, with concerns raised by both conservatives and liberals. While there's agreement on the problem, solutions remain elusive, as banks maintain their right to avoid high-risk customers. The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to address the issue, while critics argue that debanking is often a matter of risky businesses seeking to avoid scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Liverpool are ready to trigger the release clause of Bayer Leverkusen's Jeremie Frimpong as they close in on their first summer signing. The 24-year-old, who can play across the right-hand side, is wanted by fellow Dutchman Arne Slot for next season's campaign and talks towards a deal have progressed in recent days. If the Premier League champions can complete a swoop for the Netherlands international, it could help soften the blow of losing Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is set to join Real Madrid after confirming his decision to leave Anfield when his contract expires at the end of the season.</p>
