          <p>The White House is considering BlackRock's chief investment officer, Rick Rieder, as a potential successor to Jerome Powell for the role of Federal Reserve chair. Rieder recently interviewed with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the search and has expressed a desire for fundamental changes at the central bank. This development adds another high-profile Wall Street figure to the list of candidates, which includes former Fed governors and economists. The search occurs as the Fed is widely expected to implement an interest rate cut, a move President Trump has been demanding. (not investment advice)</p>

Baldoni's legal team had sought to depose Swift, a friend of Lively's, and requested a deadline extension to accommodate her schedule. However, Swift's lawyer stated she has no material role in the case and would only comply if compelled by the court. This development is the latest turn in the dueling lawsuits between the "It Ends With Us" co-stars, which involve allegations of sexual harassment and defamation.</p>

          <h2>Salesforce CEO Acknowledges Palantir's Market Success While Criticizing Its High Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 17:01:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on the success of data analytics firm Palantir, expressing admiration for its high stock market valuation while also taking a jab at its pricing. Speaking at a technology conference, Benioff described Palantir's software as "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen," suggesting he might not be charging enough for his own company's products. While Salesforce remains much larger by revenue, Palantir is experiencing faster growth and has surpassed Salesforce in market capitalization. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two companies, which sometimes compete for major government contracts.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has announced that its Ram brand is canceling plans to develop a fully electric version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck. The company cited slowing demand for battery electric trucks in North America as the primary reason for reassessing its product strategy. Ram had already delayed the launch of the all-electric truck twice. Instead of a fully battery-electric vehicle, the brand will focus on launching an extended-range electric truck, the Ram 1500 REV, which includes a gasoline-powered generator. This strategic shift reflects broader adjustments within the auto industry as automakers respond to evolving market conditions for electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>The conviction and sentencing of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for conspiracies related to his 2022 election loss serves as a significant international parallel to the political situation in the United States. Bolsonaro, an ally of President Trump, was found guilty of attempting to instigate a coup and has been barred from public office, a decisive form of accountability. This article argues that Trump's attempt to intervene on Bolsonaro's behalf highlights the similarities in their political styles, including undermining democratic norms and encouraging political violence. The author suggests that Brazil's handling of its former leader provides a stark contrast and a lesson in democratic accountability.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the prime minister's resignation, Nepal has appointed its first female leader, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki. The 73-year-old was sworn in as interim prime minister after a deal was reached with protest leaders. The unrest, which killed over 50 people, was initially sparked by a social media ban but grew into a mass movement against the political elite. Karki's interim government now faces the immense challenge of restoring order, rebuilding damaged government buildings, and preparing for a general election scheduled for next March.</p>
