          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw a general increase after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order, reducing Japanese auto import tariffs to 15% and confirming $550 billion in Japanese investments in U.S. projects. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices rose, as did South Korea's Kospi. Several Asian chip stocks also climbed after Trump's comments about potential tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms not moving production to the U.S. This positive market reaction was also influenced by hopes for a favorable August jobs report in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, suggested that enterprises might resist the adoption of agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. While acknowledging their consumer appeal for automating tasks like booking flights, Arora emphasized the critical need for integrated credential management and enterprise-grade security. He predicted major tech companies would develop such browsers but warned of a conflict with corporate security concerns regarding AI agents' autonomy. Arora also highlighted his company's planned acquisition of CyberArk to enhance identity security, citing credential theft as a primary cause of data breaches.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court upheld an injunction preventing the State Department from enforcing a Trump administration policy that restricted transgender and nonbinary Americans from obtaining passports reflecting their gender identities. The policy, initiated by an executive order, sought to recognize only male and female biological genders, requiring "biological sex at birth" on passports. The American Civil Liberties Union successfully argued the policy violated constitutional rights. The appeals court affirmed the lower court's finding that the policy reflected "unconstitutional animus" and would cause "immediate and irreparable harms."</p>

          <p>Hunan province in China is considering using the digital yuan (e-CNY) to address persistent payment defaults and "chain debts." This initiative aims to expand the digital currency's applications beyond its current uses, which have been explored since its 2019 launch. The proposed model would allow funds to reach the end of payment chains directly, enhancing transaction traceability and transparency. Analysts suggest this could improve real-time visibility and control over economic transactions, potentially streamlining the resolution of complex debt relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London City Lionesses have reportedly agreed to a world-record £1.4 million deal to acquire Paris St-Germain midfielder Grace Geyoro, alongside signing Spain international Lucia Corrales for £430,000. These transfers signify a significant investment by the club's wealthy American owner, Michele Kang, marking 16 permanent signings this summer. Geyoro, a French international, is considered one of Europe's top midfielders. This move highlights London City's ambition to challenge the established order in the Women's Super League, operating independently of a men's club and investing heavily in talent and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly prevalent, with a third of American adults having at least one, indicating a shift towards openness and individuality. Despite this mainstream embrace, a significant stigma still exists, impacting perceptions of professionalism and trustworthiness. Studies show tattooed individuals may face challenges in employment and social acceptance. While over 40% of millennials are tattooed, compared to 13% of baby boomers, regret is also common, with a quarter of people wishing they hadn't gotten at least one tattoo. Efforts are being made to recognize tattooing as a legitimate art form.</p>

          <p>The DeKalb County School District in Georgia has implemented a "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, banning student cellphone use during school hours, with positive results. Teachers at Lakeside High School, the largest in the district, noted a significant improvement in the learning environment and student engagement, along with a decrease in disruptions and disciplinary issues. This local initiative precedes a statewide ban on K-8 cellphone use starting in 2026. The program's success aligns with a national trend, as over half of U.S. states now regulate or ban student cellphone use in schools.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have pledged to provide postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, including an international force on land, sea, and air. These troops would not be on the frontline but aim to prevent future aggression. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed this as a significant step. The commitment follows European leaders' efforts to secure U.S. backing and address concerns about President Trump's stance on the conflict. While some countries are hesitant about troop deployments, the focus remains on financing, arming, and training Ukrainian forces, with a breakthrough in European nations buying U.S. arms for Ukraine.</p>

Bowie's notes, now donated to the V&A Museum, reveal his deep fascination with the period's vibrant and diverse culture.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stated that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was "based on mathematics." Parsons signed a four-year, $186 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones explained that the compensation for Parsons, compared to the value of draft picks received, allowed the Cowboys to allocate resources to multiple other top-tier players. He emphasized the strategic financial choice, aiming to mitigate "availability issues" and maximize the number of playing personnel on the field. (not investment advice)</p>
