          <p>The White House has retracted the nomination of Jared Isaacman as the next NASA administrator, just before the Senate confirmation vote. A White House spokesperson stated that the new leader of NASA should be fully aligned with President Trump's "America First" agenda, emphasizing the goal of planting the American flag on Mars. Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, previously testified before the Senate Commerce Committee, where he expressed his commitment to prioritizing American astronauts on Mars and clarified that a lunar landing would precede a Mars mission. No specific reason was given for the withdrawal of his nomination. Optimism around the space program is in a state of relative stability.</p>
