        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are striving to end Canada's Stanley Cup drought, which dates back to 1993, as they face a critical Game 6 against the Florida Panthers in Miami. Despite a strong start to the series, the Oilers' recent loss has raised concerns that history may repeat itself, uniting Canadian fans in support of the team. The article delves into the reasons behind the losing streak, including the NHL's expansion into the U.S. and the draw of warmer climates and tax breaks for players. Amidst trade tensions between Canada and the U.S., a Canadian win would be a symbolic victory.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has secured a $200 million contract to provide the U.S. Defense Department with artificial intelligence tools, marking its first contract listed on the department's website. The one-year contract will involve developing prototype frontier AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges. This move aligns with OpenAI's expressed interest in engaging in national security areas, as stated by CEO Sam Altman. The work will primarily occur in the National Capital Region, and the contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's growing revenue.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, offering an additional 500 campsites. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, but the National Parks Service is now able to fully reopen them. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but camping spots at Yosemite are notoriously competitive and often fill up quickly. Visitors can still access the park using day passes when campgrounds are unavailable.</p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass reduced the hours of the nightly curfew in downtown Los Angeles, allowing businesses to remain open later into the evening. The curfew, which began last week in response to chaotic protests, will now begin at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. The decision reflects progress in reducing crime and vandalism within the curfew zone, according to Bass. The LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the area to ensure the safety of residents, businesses, and demonstrators.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom at the G7 summit in Canada, stating it was similar to one signed in May. He accidentally dropped the document and misspoke, saying the agreement was with the European Union. The White House clarified the agreement was with the UK, providing additional details on steel and aluminum. Trump praised Prime Minister Keir Starmer, noting that he has done a very good job.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer and Donald Trump finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with Trump saying Britain would have protection against future tariffs ‚Äúbecause I like them‚Äù. The deal covers aerospace and the auto sector, with the UK aerospace sector facing no tariffs and the auto industry having 10% tariffs. Trump praised Starmer, calling him a longtime partner and friend, and said the UK was protected because he liked them. The US still wants assurances about the Chinese owners of British Steel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in research grants at the National Institutes of Health was illegal, citing unlawful racial discrimination. The cuts, which targeted research with a perceived connection to diversity, equity, and inclusion, were ordered to be reinstated. The judge added that he had ‚Äúnever seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable‚Äù, with the lawsuit filed by organizations and 16 Democratic-led states. The ruling only applies to some grants mentioned in the lawsuit, with further claims to be ruled on after additional evidence is presented.</p>
