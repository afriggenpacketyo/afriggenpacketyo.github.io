          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Department of Justice has agreed to remove its newly appointed emergency police chief for the city and rewrite a directive that challenged D.C.'s sanctuary city policies. The agreement came after a federal judge signaled she would likely block the Trump administration's move to take full operational control of the Metropolitan Police Department. Under the resolution, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in her role, scaling back the federal takeover that had been initiated under the Home Rule Act. Arguments over the administration's immigration directives are set to continue next week.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) condominium, which can be sold separately from the main property it is built on. This development follows a city law passed last year aimed at creating more accessible homeownership opportunities amid the state's housing crisis. Mayor Matt Mahan expressed hope that this ADU, located near downtown, will serve as a model for other cities to adopt similar policies. ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a way to increase housing density and provide more affordable starter homes for residents.</p>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the conventional belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. The studies found that consuming moderate amounts of certain mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread and, when substituted for carbohydrates, led to improvements in key metabolic health markers. Researchers suggest that controlled consumption of mangoes could be beneficial for individuals with type 2 diabetes, improving fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and cholesterol levels. Experts emphasize that moderation and clinical supervision are crucial, as the findings are not a license for unlimited indulgence in the popular fruit.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win features an altered version of an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. Instead of his classic gold Lakers jersey, the mural portrays Bryant wearing a white and blue No. 24 jersey with "Dodgers" across the chest. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that the change was a creative choice to keep the artwork on theme with the Dodgers tribute while still honoring the Lakers legend. The piece has generated mixed reactions online and among passersby, sparking conversations about the intersection of Los Angeles sports loyalties.</p>

          <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament has recommended that everyone in England under the age of 22 should receive free bus travel, similar to a program already in place in Scotland. The proposal aims to help young people access work and education more affordably. Young adults interviewed by the BBC described current bus fares as "extortionate," stating that the costs impact their ability to socialize, save money, and even afford food. While the Department for Transport highlighted its existing funding for bus services, advocates argue that free travel would provide significant financial relief and greater independence for the younger generation.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback with the re-opening of physical, standalone stores on the UK High Street, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, is also hosting its first catwalk show in seven years to mark its return. Industry experts note that while there is significant nostalgia for the brand among millennials and Gen-Z, its success will depend on attracting new, younger shoppers and re-establishing its reputation for trend-setting fashion. The company aims to balance its iconic "London girl" aesthetic with the demands of the modern, cost-conscious consumer market.</p>

Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win for the reigning champions. The match was also marked by an emotional tribute to the late Diogo Jota and was temporarily paused due to an allegation of racist abuse from the crowd directed at a Bournemouth player.</p>

However, the industry's rapid expansion is now being tested by market saturation, intense price wars, and the challenges of maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised outlets.

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by producing a simple, barebones pickup truck that owners can customize themselves. The compact, two-seat Slate Truck is designed with minimal features to reduce manufacturing costs, with the company planning to sell over 100 add-on accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. While the company initially advertised a sub-$20,000 price point with federal tax credits, the expiration of those incentives raises questions about whether the truck will remain competitive against other models in the sub-$30,000 price range.</p>

The resolution, sponsored by Representatives Jamie Raskin and Eleanor Holmes Norton, argues that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required by the Home Rule Act to justify such a takeover. This legislative action follows a legal challenge from D.C. officials, which resulted in an agreement to scale back federal control. Lawmakers contend the move is a politically motivated overreach and part of a broader attack on the district's autonomy.</p>
