          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport due to a landing gear issue during takeoff. Passengers used emergency slides to exit the Boeing 737 MAX 8 as smoke was seen billowing from the aircraft. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely evacuated, with one person transported for a minor injury. The airline confirmed a maintenance issue with a tire, and the FAA is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that has led some modern scholars to dismiss it as a myth. Using modern scientific principles and new clues, scientists hope to restore the lost wonder and validate its historical accounts. The original invention was reportedly a significant technological achievement for its time.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The outage disabled the train's air conditioning and lighting, leaving passengers in the heat and dark. The evacuation was delayed when some passengers attempted to leave the tunnel on foot, forcing a secondary power-down for safety reasons. All passengers were eventually evacuated via emergency exits, with only two people requiring on-site medical treatment for minor issues.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, though an MRI revealed no acute damage to the ulnar collateral ligament. The diagnosis came as a relief, as a more serious injury could have ended his season. Judge, who leads the major leagues in several offensive categories, will receive a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 to 14 days. He hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once the strain has healed.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average temperatures in July running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While inland areas of California have faced oppressive heat, the Bay Area has remained unusually cool, a phenomenon that has become a topic of local conversation. Experts note that despite the cold start, the region's hottest months are often in September and October.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from residents of new property developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in vacant shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. The government hopes these measures will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry.</p>
