          <p>A top US Air Force official has announced that production has begun on the new F-47 sixth-generation fighter jet, with the first aircraft scheduled to fly in 2028. The F-47, developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program, is set to replace the aging F-22 fleet and ensure future air superiority. According to US Air Force Chief of Staff General David Allvin, the program is moving at a rapid pace following years of secret development and testing, with manufacturer Boeing already manufacturing the first unit. This development marks a significant step in advancing US military aviation technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra have discovered a submerged ancient port near the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria. The Egyptian-Dominican mission, using advanced sonar technology, mapped the seabed and identified a former inner harbor connected to the temple by a tunnel. The discovery of Ptolemaic-era anchors and pottery confirms the site was an active maritime zone, offering new insights into the region's history. Lead archaeologist Dr. Kathleen Martinez remains convinced that this temple complex, not Alexandria, is the true resting place of Cleopatra and plans to begin underwater excavations.</p>

          <p>The trend of giving children alternatively spelled names, such as 'Oaklynn' or 'Sadilynn', has sparked significant online debate and mockery, often concentrated in social media groups dedicated to so-called 'tragedeighs'. Experts suggest this phenomenon is driven by parents' desire for individuality and a way to signal gender in non-traditional names, a practice with historical roots. However, the intense backlash appears rooted in social factors, including a preference for familiar names and classism associated with 'quiet luxury' aesthetics. While these unique spellings are growing in visibility, data shows they remain statistically rare, reflecting a broader trend toward greater overall name diversity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 05:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel process known as phytomining is being developed to extract valuable metals like nickel from soil using hyperaccumulating plants. These specific plants naturally absorb high concentrations of metals, which can then be harvested by burning the plant matter to create a metal-rich 'bio-ore'. This method offers a climate-friendly alternative to conventional mining, as it is nearly carbon-neutral and can remediate land unsuitable for agriculture. While the technology shows promise for decentralized, small-scale operations and securing local supply chains, its scalability is a major challenge, as it would require vast areas of land to match the output of a single traditional mine.</p>

The deal involves OpenAI building extensive data center infrastructure using millions of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), signaling immense demand in the AI sector. This news boosted shares of companies in Nvidia's supply chain, including Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's SK Hynix, with positive effects extending to European equipment manufacturers. The investment is being interpreted by the market as a strong confirmation that the demand for AI-related hardware remains robust and is far from peaking. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has strengthened into a Category 4 major hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. The storm is currently located over 300 miles east of Bermuda and is tracking northeast, posing no direct threat to land. However, the National Hurricane Center has issued warnings that powerful swells generated by Gabrielle will create life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, from North Carolina to Canada. The storm's formation marks an increase in activity after a relatively quiet start to the hurricane season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a major speech at the United Nations General Assembly, where he is expected to focus on renewing American strength and critique the role of 'globalist institutions.' His address comes as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are set to dominate the session's agenda. The speech follows a move by several key U.S. allies, including France and the U.K., to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a decision the Trump administration opposes, viewing it as a 'reward to Hamas.' Trump will also hold several bilateral and multilateral meetings with world leaders to discuss these pressing global issues.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's plan to raise H-1B visa fees to $100,000, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed qualified support for the changes.

Altman stated that attracting the 'smartest people' to the country is essential and that streamlining the process with financial incentives seems positive.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has raised its global economic growth forecast for the current year to 3.2%, citing greater-than-expected resilience, particularly in the United States and emerging markets. The upgrade is attributed to strong AI-related investment in the U.S. and fiscal support in China, which have helped offset challenges from trade tensions. However, the OECD warns that significant risks remain, including the yet-to-be-fully-felt impact of increased U.S. tariffs, softening labor markets, and persistent, though slightly lower, inflation. Policy uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on the overall economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pledged 'large and forceful' actions to support Argentina's volatile peso, potentially utilizing the Treasury's $219.5 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund. This promise of a backstop provided a significant short-term boost to Argentine assets, which had suffered major losses. The move reflects President Trump's affinity for Argentine President Javier Milei's right-wing, reform-oriented government. While the support could help stabilize the currency temporarily, analysts note that any conditions attached to a U.S. loan or intervention could complicate Argentina's already complex debt situation with other creditors like the IMF and China.

          <p>Following President Trump's assertion linking Tylenol (acetaminophen) to autism, scientists and medical experts are emphasizing that there is no credible evidence to support such a claim. Researchers state that autism spectrum disorder is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with strong genetic links, involving hundreds of gene variants, not a single external cause. While diagnoses have risen, experts attribute this to increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria rather than a single environmental factor. The scientific community has vigorously and repeatedly debunked similar unsubstantiated claims, such as the disproven theory that vaccines cause autism, stressing the danger of such misinformation.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is launching a new initiative called 'Jess's Rule,' urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists in cases of ongoing, unexplained illness. The initiative seeks to prevent avoidable tragedies, particularly among younger patients whose serious conditions are sometimes overlooked.</p>

          <p>The remnants of Hurricane Gabrielle, a major storm currently in the Atlantic, could bring wet and windy weather to the UK this weekend, though its exact path remains uncertain. After intensifying near Bermuda, the hurricane is forecast to weaken as it travels east across the Atlantic. Major weather models are currently in disagreement, with one projecting the storm system will bring heavy rain to the UK before hitting Portugal, while another shows it moving into the Bay of Biscay and impacting Spain. This potential for more rainfall follows an already soggy September for many parts of the UK, which saw above-average precipitation.</p>
