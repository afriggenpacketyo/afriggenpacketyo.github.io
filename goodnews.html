          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with severe heart issues, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant after her body produced too many antibodies, making a traditional heart transplant risky. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, proposed the innovative surgery to address the antibody problem, as the liver helps reduce antibody levels. Post-surgery, Baker faced a long recovery and personal tragedy with the death of her husband, leading to financial instability. Her successful transplant has opened the door for similar procedures, offering hope to other patients with complex medical conditions. </p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its home-grown operating system, OpenHarmony, in space, reducing reliance on foreign software and improving the performance of small satellites. The Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat conducted over 1,000 hours of in-orbit testing using OpenHarmony, a lightweight version of Huawei‚Äôs open-source platform. The satellite delivered faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following the mission, national technical standards are proposed to encourage broader adoption of OpenHarmony in commercial and research satellite missions in China. </p>

          <p>Former Obama speechwriter David Litt's new book explores an unlikely friendship with his brother-in-law, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, learns to surf with the help of his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a tattooed truck driver who listens to Joe Rogan and never registered to vote. Surfing becomes a metaphor for confronting fear and an antidote to overthinking, providing a neutral ground for connection. The article highlights the deep political and cultural divisions in America and the importance of finding shared activities to bridge those divides. </p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel, Audition, explores themes of incarceration and human connection through the story of three giants hurtling through space. The giants, once regular-sized humans, are confined to a spaceship that gets its power from their speech. The novel examines how language can be used as a tool of exploitation and how the giants' past traumas shape their present. Ultimately, the novel suggests that true possibility lies beyond the hard borders that separate and constrain life on Earth. </p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases. The scheme, part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, will involve sequencing their complete DNA using blood samples from their umbilical cord. This initiative aims to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses, with a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. While experts praise the potential benefits, they caution about the need for qualified professionals to interpret the data for patients. </p>
