The wreck, located nearly 400 feet deep in the Aegean Sea, yielded items including the ship's lookout bell, a navigation lamp, and decorative tiles from a Turkish bath. The operation, conducted by an 11-person team, provides new insights into the vessel's design and history.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom was marked by a lavish reception from the royal family, which the president reportedly enjoyed immensely. However, an analysis of the trip suggests that while the personal relationship between Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer appeared warm, the UK's ability to influence U.S. policy remains limited. Despite amicable discussions, key disagreements on issues like Palestinian statehood were not resolved, and White House officials indicated the visit would not alter U.S. positions on trade or tariffs. The visit successfully demonstrated a strong diplomatic relationship, allowing Starmer to maintain a positive rapport without ceding ground on core principles.</p>

          <p>The new film from director Paul Thomas Anderson, "One Battle After Another," is praised in this review as an electrifying and urgent blockbuster. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a retired revolutionary forced back into action, the movie is described as a departure from Anderson's typically historical settings, instead tackling contemporary themes of political violence and government overreach. The film is lauded for its kinetic action sequences, strong performances from DiCaprio and Sean Penn, and its ability to blend genre storytelling with poignant commentary. It is ultimately hailed as an emotional and visceral triumph that feels both sprawling and taut.</p>

The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior border patrol chief. Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving the defendant but did not capture the alleged assault. The trial revealed factual discrepancies in official reports and brought up a past misconduct investigation against the testifying chief, undermining the prosecution's case.</p>

A 10-year loan now has an average monthly payment of around $618, while a 15-year term averages about $487, both marginally lower than costs earlier in the year. The article notes that with U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, these loans offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards.

          <p>This article traces the evolution of American universities, highlighting a persistent tension between three distinct functions: cultural formation, career preparation, and academic research. It contrasts the 19th-century classical college model, focused on creating cultured individuals, with the vision of reformers like Harvard's Charles Eliot, who advocated for more practical, career-oriented training. The later emergence of the research university, exemplified by Johns Hopkins, added another layer, prioritizing faculty scholarship. The author argues that this fundamental debate over what college is for has never been resolved, fueling contemporary anxieties about the value of a university degree.</p>
