          <h2>How Investigative Genetic Genealogy is Helping Law Enforcement Solve Cold Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:28:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The field of investigative genetic genealogy, pioneered by individuals like Barbara Rae-Venter, is revolutionizing how law enforcement solves cold cases. By using public DNA databases to build family trees of unknown suspects, investigators have successfully identified notorious criminals, including the Golden State Killer. This powerful technique has brought long-awaited justice to victims but has also sparked a debate about genetic privacy and the ethics of using personal DNA data for criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>The UK's transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric cars cheaper to purchase. While not confirming if this would involve direct grants, she pointed to a new funding package for councils to install easier charging solutions for homes without driveways. This initiative aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs and improve charging infrastructure to accelerate the transition away from petrol and diesel vehicles.</p>

          <p>Women's basketball hall-of-famer Nancy Lieberman has called on WNBA players to "embrace" rookie sensation Caitlin Clark and move past any jealousy. Lieberman compared Clark's impact to that of Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, arguing that her ability to generate revenue and attention benefits the entire league. She urged players to celebrate each other's success and focus on growing the sport together rather than engaging in petty rivalries.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must become more "self-centred" to effectively project the country's soft power. He advocates for building an "indigenous knowledge system" based on China's own practical and political experiences rather than relying on Western academic models. This approach, he believes, is necessary to accurately explain China's practices and predict its future development to a global audience.</p>
