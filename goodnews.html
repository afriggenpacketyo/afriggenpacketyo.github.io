          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The company anticipates some job reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) against more flexible money market accounts. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher interest rates, these rates are variable and subject to change with market conditions. In contrast, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return for the duration of their term, which may offer more security for risk-averse individuals. The choice depends on a saver's priority between flexibility and guaranteed long-term returns (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley claims that the two young princes, Edward V and his brother Richard, were not murdered in the Tower of London in the 15th century. Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, argues that the princes survived and that the narrative of their murder was Tudor propaganda. Her decade-long 'Missing Princes Project' reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting the elder prince, Edward, later re-emerged as the pretender Lambert Simnel. This challenges the long-held belief that their uncle, Richard III, had them killed to secure the throne.</p>

          <p>Over four decades after the disappearance of his girlfriend, a 72-year-old man has been extradited to Oregon to face a murder charge. Mark Sanfratello is accused of killing 27-year-old Teresa Peroni, who was last seen with him after a party in July 1983. The case was reopened in 2024, and investigators used modern forensic testing and new DNA evidence to link a skull found in 1997 to Peroni. This breakthrough led a grand jury to indict Sanfratello, highlighting how technological advancements can bring resolution to long-unsolved cold cases.</p>

          <p>American Express revealed that its affluent customer base continues to spend robustly, with total card spending up 7% in the second quarter. However, the company noted a specific weakness in travel, as spending on airline tickets has stalled compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower domestic economy airfare prices. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, Amex shares fell amid investor concerns over the high costs of its rewards programs and increasing competition in the premium credit card market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The traditional royal 'swan upping' ceremony on the River Thames has revealed a positive trend for the swan population, with numbers beginning to recover after a significant decline. The five-day census found 115 young swans, a notable increase from the 86 counted last year, suggesting a reversal of the 45% drop seen over the past two years. The decline was attributed to avian flu and human cruelty. While the numbers are still below previous highs, the results offer a hopeful sign for the conservation of this iconic royal bird.</p>

          <p>A new University of Michigan survey indicates that consumers' expectations for inflation have fallen to their lowest levels since before President Trump's tariff announcements in April. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5% in June, suggesting that consumers believe the impact of tariffs on prices will be temporary. Despite this improved short-term outlook, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as expectations remain above their late 2024 levels (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. This article explains that eligibility for programs like debt management or settlement is based on financial hardship and the ability to make payments, not the source of income. Because Social Security benefits are protected from creditors, recipients have a stable foundation for pursuing solutions. Strategies such as credit counseling and hardship programs offered by card issuers can provide viable paths to reducing debt without requiring new loans (not investment advice).</p>

During an event in London, the couple shared their story and stressed the urgency of reaching another agreement. Aviva Siegel also praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and expressed a desire to meet with U.S. officials to advocate for the remaining captives.</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are distinguishing themselves from competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the top seven U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive international networks, and a focus on premium travel, which have provided a buffer against a challenging market. While the industry faces headwinds from falling domestic airfares and overcapacity in coach class, both carriers have pointed to the strength of their premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs. This strategy appears to be helping them outperform the rest of the airline pack.</p>

          <p>A 'no tax on tips' provision in President Trump's new legislation has been enacted, but details on its implementation remain unclear. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, which still leaves tips subject to payroll and state taxes. Tax professionals are awaiting clarification from the IRS, expected in October, on which specific occupations will qualify for the break. The legislation already excludes certain professions like actors and musicians, and further uncertainty exists around how unreported cash tips will be handled under the new rule.</p>
