          <p>During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 Summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the UK, accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentifying it as an agreement with the European Union. When questioned about the differences between this agreement and a previous one signed in May, Trump stated that there were not many significant changes. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom, and provided additional details regarding steel and aluminum quotas. Trump praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister, concluding the bilateral meeting on a positive note.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its government bond-buying program at a slower pace than initially planned, while maintaining its current interest rates. This decision reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy due to uncertainties surrounding trade and economic conditions, particularly in light of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about the potential negative impact of Trump's tariffs on Japan's export-driven economy. The central bank will continue to monitor developments and adjust its policies as needed to avoid market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>
