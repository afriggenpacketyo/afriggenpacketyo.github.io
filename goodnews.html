          <p>A recent New York court ruling deemed President Trump's blanket import taxes illegal, raising questions about its impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. However, the ruling does not affect tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute the bulk of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, the agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling blocks Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, leaving the future uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the crucial role of UK saltmarshes as carbon sinks, locking away greenhouse gases in layers of mud. Saltmarshes have been largely lost to agriculture, but the charity is advocating for their recognition in the UK's official carbon emission and removal inventory. Researchers from the UK's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology used monitoring stations to measure gas exchange in a restored saltmarsh, revealing that plants absorb more carbon dioxide in summer than they release in winter. The report emphasizes the importance of protecting and restoring these habitats for climate change mitigation and coastal flood defense.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first debate in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to choose separate surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of any of the three opposition-submitted bills appears unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant, citing concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is necessary to enable couples to maintain different family names, a change that has been increasingly advocated for by business leaders and supported by a majority of the public.</p>

This dismissal signifies a shift in the regulatory landscape, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the crypto industry.
