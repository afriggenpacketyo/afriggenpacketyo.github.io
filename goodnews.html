        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool secured a decisive 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt in the Champions League, despite ongoing defensive vulnerabilities and a new tactical approach from manager Arne Slot. Slot made bold calls, benching talismanic Mohamed Salah and experimenting with a 4-4-2 shape out of possession, starting British record signing Alexander Isak alongside Huge Ekitike for the first time. This partnership showed promise before Isak suffered a groin injury at half-time, raising concerns about his recovery. The team's high-pressing football was particularly effective in the second half, with five different players contributing goals. This emphatic win, though marred by Isak's injury, offers a potential glimpse into Liverpool's future strategies and squad depth, especially with the upcoming Afcon tournament impacting Salah's availability and form.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NextSilicon, an Israeli startup with $300 million in funding, has unveiled plans to develop a new central processing unit (CPU) using RISC-V technology, aiming to challenge market leaders Intel and AMD. This new CPU will complement their flagship "Maverick-2" chip, which is already in production and being evaluated by U.S. national labs like Sandia National Laboratories. The Maverick-2 is designed to speed up high-precision scientific computing tasks, a niche where NextSilicon seeks to capitalize as Nvidia shifts its focus towards lower-precision artificial intelligence tasks. The company claims its Maverick-2 can perform some of the same work as Nvidia chips, but faster and using less power, crucially without requiring extensive software code modifications, showing significant promise for advancing computational capabilities.</p>

          <p>Amidst stark disagreements with the U.S. on climate change, China is actively pursuing an ambitious transformation towards a climate-proof future, as highlighted by President Xi Jinping at the UN General Assembly. While U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as "the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world," Xi unveiled Beijing’s latest strategies, aiming to cut China's emissions by 7-10% from peak levels by 2035 and increase non-fossil fuels in its energy mix to over 30%, focusing on wind and solar power. Driven by data on rising risks of floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather, Chinese policymakers are re-engineering urban landscapes with an emphasis on resilience. Analysts suggest this transition to green and low-carbon energy also makes significant economic sense for China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The fifth episode of Celebrity Traitors saw mounting pressure and internal strife as the Faithfuls struggled to identify the Traitors, leading to another Faithful, singer Charlotte Church, being "murdered." Host Claudia Winkleman openly criticized the celebrities for their collective failure to catch a Traitor, emphasizing the loss of seven Faithfuls. However, cracks began to appear within the treacherous trio of Traitors—Alan Carr, Jonathan Ross, and Cat Burns—with Burns notably turning on Ross and raising his name at the tense roundtable. The episode culminated in a dramatic tied vote at the roundtable between two Faithfuls, Scottish actor Mark Bonnar and historian David Olusoga, leaving their banishment to "the hands of fate" and further exasperating viewers and social media users who expressed frustration at the Faithfuls' ineptitude.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines reported a surprise profit for the third quarter, beating analyst estimates, and projected record sales for the current quarter due to strong travel demand and higher fares. The carrier anticipates unit revenue to increase by 1% to 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% year-over-year, assuming current demand strength persists. Despite previously cutting its 2025 profit forecast to $600 million to $800 million, Southwest reaffirmed this full-year earnings outlook. The airline is actively adapting its strategies, including abandoning longtime policies like open seating and two free checked bags for each traveler, to enhance competitiveness and revenue, with CFO Tom Doxey expecting increased sales from seat assignments to materialize in the first quarter of next year.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees from its artificial intelligence unit, a move confirmed by chief AI officer Alexandr Wang, who aims to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. The cuts impact various AI infrastructure units, including Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) and product-related positions, but spared employees within TBD Labs, Wang's top-tier AI hires. This restructuring underscores CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on new, expensive hires over legacy employees, as Meta aggressively overhauls its AI strategy to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. The AI unit was considered "bloated," with teams often vying for computing resources, making these layoffs an attempt to trim the department and consolidate Wang's leadership.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that Bad Bunny will remain the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, despite criticism from President Donald Trump and his supporters. Goodell defended the decision, citing Bad Bunny's immense global popularity as "one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world" and emphasizing the careful thought given to the selection. Trump had publicly expressed unfamiliarity with the artist and called the choice "absolutely ridiculous" on Newsmax. Bad Bunny, known for performing primarily in Spanish and his vocal opposition to Trump's policies, will lead the show at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Goodell expressed confidence it would be a "great show" and a "united moment," acknowledging that additional talent could be added to the lineup.</p>

          <p>Former Biden administration officials advocate for a focused U.S. industrial policy centered on strategic, cutting-edge technologies, rather than a wholesale revival of manufacturing, particularly in areas where the U.S. has little competitive advantage. Gina Raimondo, former Commerce Secretary, emphasized the necessity of industrial policy for national security, citing the Chips Act, but disagreed with a broad "make everything in America" approach, acknowledging a different view from the current administration. This discussion occurs amidst ongoing debates in U.S. policy circles about whether the nation should borrow from China’s playbook as bilateral competition intensifies, with China making big bets on advanced manufacturing and future industries like AI and biotech. Raimondo specifically highlighted that the U.S. lacks a competitive advantage in certain areas, such as making car seats for babies.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Atlas, an AI-powered web browser, prompting questions about its core mission to "benefit all of humanity" and "cure cancer." CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as a "once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be," integrating ChatGPT for seamless web surfing, utilizing "browser memories," and offering an "agent" mode for task automation. However, critics note the browser largely mimics existing functionalities, serving primarily to embed ChatGPT deeper into users' lives and collect more data. This commercial pivot, including new apps, erotica features, and e-commerce integrations, appears driven by the immense, currently unprofitable, computational costs of developing advanced AI models, with the company facing billions in projected losses by 2029, necessitating new revenue streams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in Neurology Open Access suggests a significant link between gum disease and an increased risk of stroke and brain damage. One study found adults with gum disease are more likely to show signs of damage to the brain's white matter than those without, associating inflammation from gum disease with atherosclerosis and hardening of small blood vessels. Another study revealed that having both gum disease and cavities is linked to an 86% increased risk of stroke compared to people with healthy mouths. Crucially, the research also found that diligent oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, and regular dentist visits for preventative cleaning, can reduce stroke risk by as much as 81%, emphasizing the profound impact of oral health on cardiovascular well-being.</p>

CEO Jared Wolff affirmed the bank's belief in Los Angeles and its businesses, highlighting recent growth in Beverly Hills and New York City. The prominent signage is strategically important, especially with visibility during the 2028 Olympics. The bank, now the largest independent bank headquartered in Los Angeles, reported a 5% revenue climb and a net profit for the third quarter.</p>
