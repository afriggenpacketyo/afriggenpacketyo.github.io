          <p>Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, a rapper from the Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, was released on unconditional bail after being charged with displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig.

Supporters gathered outside the court, displaying flags and slogans in support of √ì hAnnaidh and Palestinian rights. The rapper denies the offense and will appear in court for the next hearing in August, with the judge noting the unavailability of an Irish interpreter for the initial hearing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 50+1 rule in German football ensures that club members retain control over the professional part of their football clubs, preventing external investors from taking complete control. This rule stipulates that the parent club must hold at least 50 percent plus one vote in its spun-off professional football company. Exceptions exist for clubs like Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, which have received continuous investment for over 20 years, while RB Leipzig faces criticism for allegedly circumventing the rule. Critics argue that the rule puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to other countries, but many fans internationally support it to protect fan culture and prevent commercialization.</p>

          <p>UK inflation remained at 3.4% in May, with chocolate prices rising at the fastest pace on record due to bad weather in cocoa-producing regions and long-term government mismanagement of the cocoa sector. Food prices overall have risen for three consecutive months, with some economists suggesting businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to customers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices, as air fares fell compared to last year. The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated the government is investing in Britain's renewal to make working people better off, while the shadow chancellor expressed concern for families.</p>

Vice President JD Vance defended Trump's position, stating that it focuses on using the American military to achieve American goals and highlighting Trump's consistency on the issue. The White House also referenced Trump's 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal as further evidence of his commitment to preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>The upcoming U.S. Dietary Guidelines are expected to remove the recommendation that adults limit alcohol consumption to one or two drinks per day. Instead, the guidelines will likely include a brief statement encouraging moderation or limiting alcohol intake due to associated health risks. This change comes as some experts argue the scientific basis for specific daily limits is limited, while others worry the message that even moderate drinking can increase risks, especially for breast cancer, will be lost. The guidelines, developed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are influential internationally and affect various policies.

Challenges include obtaining clean energy buses, training operators, and providing housing, with concerns raised about whether enough Angelenos will use public transit.

          <p>Democrat Abigail Spanberger is emphasizing her life and career in her bid for Virginia governor, releasing a new advertisement that showcases her education, CIA service, and time in Congress. She aims to appeal to a wider range of voters and position herself as a bipartisan leader focused on lowering costs and preparing students for future jobs. The messaging strategy comes as Virginia has shifted from backing Republicans to Democrats in presidential elections, but the state's gubernatorial contests have long been viewed as political bellwethers.</p>
