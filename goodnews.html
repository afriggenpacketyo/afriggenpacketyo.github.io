          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of recovering from business failure, a common but challenging aspect of entrepreneurship. The article highlights the emotional and professional toll of shutting down a company, including disappointing investors, laying off employees, and facing a personal identity crisis. Founders who transition back to corporate life can face an "entrepreneurship penalty" from recruiters but often bring valuable, wide-ranging skills. Ultimately, many entrepreneurs find that reframing their definitions of success and failure, and focusing on a mission with a deep sense of purpose, is key to building resilience and moving forward.</p>

          <p>To boost its tourism sector, China has expanded its visa-free entry policies, providing several new options for foreign visitors to enter the country without extensive paperwork. The country now allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days without a visa while transiting through major cities. Recently, Beijing also extended a 30-day visa-free stay for Russian citizens, adding to a growing list of nationalities that can benefit from relaxed entry requirements. These measures are part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to make travel more accessible and attract more international visitors.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada represents more than just a championship match; it's a clash between two vastly different funding models for the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, stands in stark contrast to Canada, whose players earn a fraction of their English counterparts and rely on fundraising to cover costs. Despite this financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, leveraging players' experience in England's top league. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that massive investment is the only path to success, potentially influencing how other nations approach funding for women's rugby.</p>

The article profiles several players who previously worked as teachers and painters before full-time contracts became available.

          <p>A new and diverse peace movement is emerging in Germany, with recent protests in Berlin drawing thousands demanding an end to the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. Organized by prominent figures like politician Sahra Wagenknecht, the movement calls for the German government to actively support peace negotiations and halt all arms deliveries to war zones. While the movement is currently fragmented and faces criticism for its positions, it reflects a growing anti-war sentiment in the country. Analysts suggest that debates over reintroducing compulsory military service could further mobilize young people and unify various factions into a more powerful, cohesive force.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union as a way to improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues would stimulate growth and benefit businesses. The Chancellor is also urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive economic impact of this deal into its forecasts. This could potentially reduce the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases to address the UK's fiscal challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giants Huawei and AI startup DeepSeek are spearheading China's efforts to develop a world-class artificial intelligence industry independent of U.S. technology. In response to U.S. trade restrictions, Huawei has unveiled its latest Ascend series chips and a hardware road map designed to compete with Nvidia's processors. Simultaneously, DeepSeek, which has developed powerful AI models, is shifting to support these domestically produced chips. This trend, encouraged by Beijing, signals a growing confidence in China's home-grown tech capabilities and represents a significant step in the nation's drive for technological self-reliance amid the ongoing tech rivalry with Washington.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed the election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. While the ruling establishes the statements were defamatory, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," which Smartmatic must prove to be awarded damages. Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, has vowed to continue his fight against voting machine companies.</p>
