          <p>Anna Kalinskaya has advanced to the Washington Open final after a decisive 6-4, 6-3 victory over Emma Raducanu, ending Raducanu's run in the semi-finals. Kalinskaya secured a key break late in the first set and maintained her aggressive strategy to control the match, handing Raducanu her first dropped set of the tournament. She will now face Leylah Fernandez, who won a grueling three-hour marathon match against third-seed Elena Rybakina. The final represents Kalinskaya's first opportunity to capture a WTA 500 title, preventing a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Fernandez.</p>

          <p>An advertisement in Vogue magazine by the brand Guess has ignited controversy by featuring a photorealistic model that was entirely generated by artificial intelligence. This marks the first time an AI-generated person has appeared in the magazine, raising questions about the future of modeling and the impact on already unrealistic beauty standards. Critics, including plus-size model Felicity Hayward, argue that using AI models is a step backward for diversity and inclusivity in the fashion industry. The company behind the AI model defends its work as a new marketing choice, while others express concern over the potential negative effects on consumer mental health.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Attempt to Reconstruct Ancient Earthquake Detector</h2>

          <p>A research team in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary seismoscope invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that some modern scholars have dismissed as a myth. Despite its removal from Chinese school curricula in 2017, scientists are now using modern technology and newly discovered clues to restore the ancient wonder. Their goal is to prove its functionality and re-establish its place as a significant scientific achievement of antiquity.</p>

          <p>The United States Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, by the Second Continental Congress with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the service played a crucial role in unifying the young nation. The celebration occurs amid recent speculation about the agency's future, though the new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated he does not believe USPS should be privatized. The anniversary events highlight the postal service's long history and its ongoing role in connecting the country.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list after an MRI revealed a flexor strain in his right elbow, though he avoided more serious ligament damage. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a platelet-rich plasma injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks. He first felt the pain during a game against Toronto after making a strong throw from the outfield. While the team and fans feared a long-term injury, the diagnosis was considered relatively good news, and Judge hopes to return initially as a designated hitter.</p>

          <p>Before the Kardashians, the MTV show "The Osbournes" turned Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne and his family into unlikely reality television stars, pioneering a new genre. The series, which ran from 2002 to 2005, blended the mundane aspects of family life with the extraordinary context of rock-and-roll fame, creating a format that felt like a "reality sitcom." Producers and television critics reflect on how the show's focus on a relatable, if chaotic, family dynamic captured a massive audience. This success paved the way for a wave of celebrity-driven reality programming that continues to dominate television today.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official from the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been beatified by the Catholic Church, a significant step toward sainthood. He was murdered in a "mafia-style" killing in 2007 after he refused to accept substantial bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. The Church has declared him a martyr, recognizing that his death was a direct result of his unwillingness to sacrifice his Christian values for money. His story is now being held up by the Church as a powerful example of integrity and courage against corruption.</p>

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the science behind the intense physical and emotional reactions experienced during major sporting events. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate, anxiety, and even affect sleep and spending habits after a match. Experts advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, maintaining a routine, and engaging in physical movement to release nervous energy. They emphasize that while the experience can be stressful, it is also a healthy way to express emotion and feel part of a larger community.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average temperatures in July running below normal and daytime highs struggling to surpass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some inland areas of California are facing oppressive heat, the Bay Area has remained unseasonably cool, a pattern not seen since the late 1990s. Forecasters warn that summer is not over, however, as the region's hottest weather often occurs in September and October.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of many establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new residential properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing their buildings. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new businesses and expanding outdoor areas in designated zones to help revitalize struggling town centers. While the government hopes this will boost the hospitality industry, critics argue that other tax policies are the primary cause of the sector's economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

During the visit, India unveiled a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects.
