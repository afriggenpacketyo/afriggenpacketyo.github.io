          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock, France is turning to the politics of remembrance, with three new initiatives aimed at recognizing and healing historical injustices. These include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these measures are largely symbolic, they reflect a growing willingness to take historical responsibility. However, some critics argue that these initiatives are easier to pass than structural reforms in areas such as pensions and education. The initiatives represent a step towards acknowledging past wrongs, but their limited practical impact results in a moderate optimism score.</p>
