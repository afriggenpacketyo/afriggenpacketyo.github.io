          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are collaborating to provide institutional investors with access to tokenized money market funds, marking a significant move to integrate blockchain technology into the $7.1 trillion industry. This partnership enables BNY Mellon's clients to invest in funds where ownership is recorded on Goldman's digital platform, aiming for more efficient and seamless transactions. Key financial players, including BlackRock and Fidelity, are already participating, highlighting the appeal of these yield-bearing digital assets compared to stablecoins. This initiative establishes a foundation for a future real-time, digital ecosystem for trading money market funds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former London-based traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. After a ten-year legal fight, the court ruled that their original trials were unfair due to misdirection of the jury, rendering the convictions unsafe. The men, who were jailed following the 2008 financial crisis, had consistently argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then common commercial practices. The Serious Fraud Office has stated it will not seek a retrial, a decision that vindicates the traders and may pave the way for others convicted in the scandal to appeal.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has agreed to a retrial for Choi Mal-ja, a woman convicted in 1964 for injuring her attacker in self-defense. At 19, Choi bit off part of a man's tongue to escape a sexual assault but was subsequently found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm, while her aggressor received a lenient sentence. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, has fought for years to clear her name, arguing her actions were a legitimate act of self-defense. In the new hearing, prosecutors have asked the court to acquit her, marking a pivotal moment for victims' rights and the legal perception of self-defense in South Korea.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed designating Apple and Google as having a "strategic market status," a move aimed at curbing their power over mobile ecosystems. The regulator is concerned about barriers to competition, potential self-preferencing of their own apps, and unfair terms for developers on their app stores. The CMA is pushing for immediate changes, including more transparent app review processes and allowing developers to direct users to alternative payment methods outside the app stores. Both tech giants have criticized the proposals, arguing they could compromise user security and privacy, setting the stage for another major regulatory battle in Europe.</p>

          <p>Early data indicates that McDonald's decision to bring back its popular Snack Wraps after a nearly ten-year absence has been a resounding success. In the first few days of the launch, restaurant traffic saw double-digit increases, and some locations even experienced temporary lettuce shortages due to overwhelming demand. This positive response is a welcome development for the company, which had been facing sluggish sales. A survey of early buyers revealed that 90% intend to purchase the item again, suggesting the sales lift could be more than a temporary trend driven by social media buzz and may provide a sustained boost to the fast-food giant.</p>

The updates include enhanced direct messaging protections that provide more information about unknown contacts and allow teens to block and report suspicious accounts more easily. This move follows the company's removal of over 600,000 accounts linked to predatory behavior earlier this year. The changes come as Meta faces increasing pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general over the impact of its platforms on the mental health and safety of young users.</p>

          <p>A Berlin court has acquitted German comedian Sebastian Hotz, known as "El Hotzo," of charges that he condoned a criminal offense through satirical online posts made after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Prosecutors had argued his posts, which joked about the attempt, constituted hate crimes that could disrupt public order. However, the judge ruled that the posts were clearly recognizable as satire, albeit in bad taste, and were not intended to incite violence. The verdict affirms the protection of satire within a liberal democracy, with the judge noting that robust debate over differing opinions is a desirable societal feature.</p>

Originally the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship in the Arctic. Using dendrochronology and archival research, a team of archaeologists and local historians pieced together its identity. The ship ultimately wrecked in a storm in 1788, but all 56 crew members survived, adding another chapter to the vessel's remarkable journey.</p>

The automotive sector is highly vulnerable to tariffs, and Germany's auto industry association is now intensifying its call for a negotiated solution to the ongoing tariff conflict with the U.S. The U.S.-Japan deal is seen as a potential precedent for reducing trade barriers with other key exporters.

However, this fundraising boom contrasts sharply with the exit market, where there have been fewer high-value IPOs and acquisitions. While a massive amount of capital is flowing into AI, the primary exit trend has been frequent, lower-value acquisitions of smaller companies by larger firms looking to integrate AI capabilities. This pattern suggests a disconnect between investor enthusiasm for funding new ventures and the current opportunities for cashing out on those investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill that could allow more individuals to access private investments traditionally reserved for the wealthy. The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create an examination to qualify individuals as "accredited investors," regardless of their income or net worth. Currently, this status is primarily based on wealth thresholds. The bill's sponsor argues that financial knowledge is a better determinant of an investor's ability to weigh risks than wealth alone, though some financial advisors express caution about expanding access to these complex assets.</p>

The author praises the company's financial stability, its history of successful innovation beyond its core search business, and its readiness to adapt to future technological shifts like AI. Despite these strengths, the article notes that Alphabet's stock is trading at a relatively low valuation compared to other tech giants like Apple, Netflix, or Nvidia. This combination of a strong, flexible business model and an affordable stock price makes it a top recommendation for investors with a multi-decade time horizon. (not investment advice)</p>
