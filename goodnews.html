          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:46:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Passengers at several U.S. airports, including Baltimore/Washington International and Fort Lauderdale International, are reportedly no longer required to remove their shoes during standard preflight security checks. This phased change, confirmed by sources familiar with the development and seemingly by the White House, marks a notable shift from the rule implemented nationwide in 2006 after the "shoe bomber" incident. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) stated it is continuously exploring new and innovative methods to enhance both the passenger experience and its robust security posture. While travelers with TSA PreCheck already benefited from this exemption, the new policy extends this convenience to a broader group, aiming to streamline the airport security process for a larger segment of the traveling public.</p>

He will succeed Michele Buck, who is retiring after nearly two decades at Hershey, including almost eight years as CEO. Tanner brings extensive experience, having spent over 30 years at PepsiCo, where he led the company's North American beverages unit, signifying a return to the consumer packaged goods space. Hershey's CEO search committee lauded Tanner as a "proven, high-impact leader" with a strong blend of customer and consumer passion, commercial acumen, and operational scale, making him well-suited to lead Hershey into its future endeavors.</p>

          <h2>German Armed Forces Witness Significant Increase in Volunteer Recruits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German Bundeswehr is experiencing a notable increase in volunteer recruits, with applications and hires rising by approximately 20% this year, a trend continuing from 2024. This surge is attributed partly to the war in Ukraine, which has motivated many young Germans like 23-year-old Tom to consider military service, including potential foreign deployments. Despite a high demand for personnel and ambitious goals to recruit up to 60,000 additional soldiers, the Bundeswehr maintains strict health, fitness, and constitutional commitment standards. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius aims to make service more attractive through better pay and plans to reintroduce medical examinations for 18-year-old men.</p>

          <p>An Alibaba expert envisions a future within five years where AI agents will significantly transform daily life, with the landscape dominated by a few fundamental model providers and numerous developers creating these agents. This perspective aligns with Alibaba's strategy to become a key AI infrastructure and fundamental model provider, having pledged at least $53 billion over the next three years for AI infrastructure investment. The company's Qwen series of open-source large language models has already gained popularity. The expert also highlighted Hong Kong's potential role in AI development, citing its capital resources, research capabilities, access to mainland China, government support, and robust legal framework.</p>

          <h2>Current Mortgage and Refinance Interest Rates: July 7, 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:26:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of July 7, 2025, national average mortgage rates are 6.00% for a 15-year loan and 6.80% for a 30-year loan, with refinance rates slightly higher. Despite current high rates and limited housing inventory, securing a good rate is possible, especially with a strong credit score. Experts anticipate potential relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes. To improve eligibility for favorable rates, strengthening one's credit profile and comparing offers from multiple lenders are crucial steps. Borrowers should also consider loan terms and fees to ensure affordability and lock in rates once a decision is made. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advocate 'Revenge Savings' Amidst Economic Anxiety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:25:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey indicates that over 40% of Americans are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting financial habits based on economic feelings, with many feeling more anxious than a year ago. This sentiment is fueling a shift from "revenge spending" to "revenge saving." Financial experts advise intentional saving rather than emotion-driven habits, recommending steps like taking a "money temperature" to assess spending and saving comfort. They also suggest "reverse budgeting," where money is first earmarked for savings goals, followed by necessary expenses and "fun money." Creating separate accounts for different goals and periodically increasing savings rates are also key strategies for building financial security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling to pay their tax bill in the current economy, various options are available to avoid serious IRS collection actions like wage garnishments or bank levies. These include setting up IRS payment plans, such as installment agreements for up to 72 months or short-term plans for 180 days. An Offer in Compromise may allow settling for a lower amount if severe financial hardship can be proven, while "Currently Not Collectible" status can temporarily delay collection. Additionally, penalty abatement might be possible for first-time offenders. Taking prompt action and seeking professional help for complex situations is crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of July 7, 2025, the national average savings account interest rate is 0.38%, according to the FDIC. However, individuals can earn significantly more by opening a high-yield savings account, with top rates ranging between 4.11% and 4.30%. These accounts, often offered by online banks with lower overheads, provide substantially higher returns, allowing savings to grow faster due to compounding interest. To secure the best rates, experts recommend choosing high-yield accounts, looking at online banks, and comparing different options to find the most favorable terms and avoid fees.

          <p>The UK Transport Secretary advises air passengers to assume the 100ml liquid limit in hand luggage remains in effect, despite Edinburgh and Birmingham airports installing new CT X-ray scanners that allow larger quantities. The rollout of this advanced technology across UK airports is inconsistent due to varying contracts and manufacturing supplies. While the new scanners aim to enhance flexibility, the Transport Secretary urges travelers to check with their specific airlines and airports before flying, including return airports abroad, as rules continue to evolve globally. The 100ml rule was introduced in 2006 following terror-related incidents.</p>
