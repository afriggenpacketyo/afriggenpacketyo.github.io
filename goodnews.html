          <p>President Trump called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates after the April jobs report exceeded expectations, continuing his pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decisions. Trump has previously criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but has recently softened his stance, though he still believes he understands interest rates better. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 177,000 in April, surpassing estimates, which led to a rise in stock futures. Trump contrasted his current message with his earlier criticism of President Biden for negative GDP numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, though profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy," noting that demand was strong but higher supply depressed prices, and that Trump's tariffs have raised uncertainty about future demand. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana.</p>
