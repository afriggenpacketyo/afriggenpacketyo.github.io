          <h2>Chicago Area Faces Rare Dust Storm Causing Near-Zero Visibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 18:49:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility. The event, unusual for the area, led the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous driving conditions, especially on major highways like Interstates 55 and 57. Visibility dropped dramatically in Chicago, affecting operations at Midway International Airport. Meteorologists noted that this was the first dust storm warning ever issued for Chicago by the Romeoville Weather Service office, recalling a similar but deadlier event in 2023 and the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. The storm, driven by strong winds from thunderstorms, created a dramatic scene, turning day into night.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 18:33:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal courts are increasingly pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing inadequate notice to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. This decision aligns with a series of cases where courts have emphasized that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, particularly when the administration claims novel powers. Legal scholars have praised the courts' defense of due process, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place, as the Trump administration is openly flouting the idea of providing due process to immigrants awaiting deportation.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU. The scheme would allow young people to move abroad for up to two years on a reciprocal basis, but specific details regarding age eligibility and numbers are yet to be determined. Kemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, has criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door," while Reform UK has echoed similar sentiments. Starmer has denied these accusations, emphasizing that Labour's manifesto has a "red line" against freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump criticized Walmart after the retailer warned it would have to raise prices due to tariffs. Trump stated that Walmart should ‚ÄúEAT THE TARIFFS‚Äù instead of charging customers more. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously mentioned that the company wants to keep its prices lower than competitors and will absorb some of the higher costs. Walmart maintained its sales forecast for the year but declined to provide an earnings or operating income forecast for the second fiscal quarter, citing the frequent changes in the Trump administration's tariff policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot has launched its Memorial Day outdoor sales event, which is a critical period for the company, with gardening and landscaping materials heavily discounted. Bernstein analysts cited "unfavorable weather, weak consumer sentiment, and mixed performance from peers and suppliers" as factors playing into what they predict to be a tough first quarter at Home Depot. The company's performance is closely tied to housing turnover, with mortgage rates needing to dip below 6.5% to stimulate the market. Tariff impact is also a concern, though those headwinds could be slowly fading amid de-escalation between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a circular mouth lined with teeth and claws extending from its head. Researchers noted that the Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods, and had an open circulatory system. The discovery of the Mosura gives scientists better insight into how diverse life on Earth was even prior to the Cambrian explosion.</p>

This self-criticism comes despite McLaren showing good form, with Norris' teammate Oscar Piastri qualifying in second place for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. Piastri spoke about his determination to ensure he kept the lead at the start, stating "As long as I can get a good start, then (I'm) confident," he said. "It's a difficult track to overtake on. Our pace has been strong. Our long-run pace yesterday looked very encouraging. So, yeah, as long as I can get a good start and have a good first lap, then that would be good."</p>
