          <p>Edmonton Oilers stars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl made a surprise appearance at a local beer league hockey game in Newmarket, Ontario, playing alongside amateur enthusiasts. The NHL duo, who were playing casually, were unexpectedly outscored, with their opponents ultimately winning the game 6-2, creating a memorable story for the local players. Viral clips showed the league's goalie making impressive saves against McDavid, though neither of the professional players scored a goal during the friendly match. McDavid later explained that he has been playing in this league with friends for over a decade, making the recent media attention on his appearance surprising to him.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase (dubbed "PARC")—that he believes will continue to rally due to strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies represent a separate track in the market, driven more by investor enthusiasm for themes like cryptocurrency and quantum computing than by traditional metrics. While Cramer acknowledged the potential for gains in these trendy names, he also cautioned investors to exercise discipline and secure profits when they achieve significant returns, as the momentum is fueled by what he terms "irrational believers."

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with flights featuring assigned seats set to begin on January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights starting July 29, 2025. The change will allow travelers to choose specific seats, including options with extra legroom, and will be accompanied by a new boarding process that groups passengers by seat location rather than the current A-C lettered system. This move, along with the recent elimination of its "bags fly free" policy, marks a significant strategic shift for the discount carrier as it seeks new revenue streams amid financial pressures.</p>

          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell is urging President Trump to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting systems, arguing it would save both lives and money. In a letter to the president, the Democratic senator outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading the Doppler radar network and weather satellites, following deadly floods in Texas. The plea comes as the Trump administration has proposed significant budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Weather Service. Cantwell emphasized that proactive investment in better forecasting technology could mitigate the multi-billion dollar costs associated with increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Eager fans lined up outside the new Tesla Diner in Hollywood, anticipating its public opening after years of planning by CEO Elon Musk. The saucer-shaped, retro-futuristic restaurant features superchargers for electric vehicles and two drive-in movie screens. Despite social media buzz suggesting a Monday opening, the doors remained closed to the public as of the afternoon. The diner held a private soft opening over the weekend for first responders and Tesla Club members, with videos showing roller-skating servers and a humanoid robot. Musk has suggested that if the concept is successful, similar diners could be established in major cities worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles over a month ago by the Trump administration. The deployment, which was met with strong objections from local and state leaders who called it unnecessary and provocative, was intended to protect federal property during protests against immigration enforcement. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the marines' presence was instrumental in restoring order and that stability has now returned to the city. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reiterated her view that the deployment was an "inappropriate misuse of our troops."</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a significant policy shift as President Javier Milei's government recalibrates its foreign relations. Starting Tuesday, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business travel. This move represents a notable overture to Beijing and comes at a time of delayed trade negotiations with the U.S. and growing American unease over Argentina's strengthening relationship with China, highlighting the delicate diplomatic balance Milei is attempting to strike between the two global superpowers.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block Inc. saw a 7% increase after S&P Global announced it will be added to the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. The inclusion prompted a surge in buying from investors and will require passive index fund managers to purchase a significant volume of the company's stock to rebalance their portfolios. The move is seen as a vote of confidence as Block works to improve performance in its Cash App business. Meanwhile, competitor Robinhood, despite a massive stock run, was once again passed over for inclusion in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>
