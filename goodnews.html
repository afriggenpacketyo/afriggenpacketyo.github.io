        </div>

          <p>This article explores the financial implications of claiming Social Security benefits at different ages, from the earliest possible at 62 to the maximum-benefit age of 70. It outlines how monthly payments are permanently reduced for early claims and increased by about 8% annually for delayed claims past full retirement age. The article suggests that while immediate need is a primary factor, those with the financial flexibility to wait can significantly boost their guaranteed lifetime income. It also discusses strategies like using other retirement accounts or annuities to bridge the income gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chelsea has reached an agreement on a club-record deal worth nearly £1 million to sign 20-year-old American forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City. The United States international is considered one of the world's most promising young talents and is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Women's Super League club. The transfer fee surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma. Thompson's arrival will provide a crucial boost to Chelsea's attack, which has been affected by recent injuries to key players Mayra Ramirez and Lauren James.</p>

          <h2>Ford's Gas-Powered Expedition SUV Sees Surge in Sales Amid EV Rush</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford has reported a significant sales increase for its large, gas-powered Expedition SUV, with August sales up 53.7% year-over-year, marking the model's best performance in 21 years. This growth in the profitable large SUV segment contrasts with the broader industry rush towards electric vehicles, although Ford's own EV sales also grew. The strong demand for the Expedition suggests a continued consumer appetite for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly for families needing three-row capacity. The success aligns with Ford's strategy of prioritizing hybrid models alongside its EV development.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated release of the video game "Hollow Knight: Silksong" led to widespread technical issues for major online game stores, including Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. Thousands of users reported being unable to purchase the game upon its launch due to the immense traffic, causing frustration among fans who have waited years for the sequel to the 2017 hit. The outage-tracking site Downdetector showed a sharp spike in user reports, and some gamers criticized the lack of a pre-order option, which they believe could have prevented the server overload. The game's composer joked that it may have "crashed the internet."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep-rooted influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved people, on American culture. The book argues that this hybrid tradition, with roots in West and Central African religions, has shaped everything from Southern cuisine and the blues to common superstitions. Stewart traces the legacy of the "conjure woman" through centuries of American history, highlighting the often-obscured contributions of Black women as healers, midwives, and cultural custodians. This exploration comes amid a resurgence of conjure's visibility in popular culture, such as in recent films and music.</p>

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old woman from Miami Gardens, has finally received her birth certificate after living her entire life without one. Born at home in Georgia during segregation, she was never officially registered, which created significant challenges when new federal Real ID laws took effect. Without proper documentation, she faced difficulties and feared potential issues with immigration authorities despite being a U.S. citizen. With the help of her son and media attention, she successfully navigated the legal process and has now obtained both her birth certificate and a Real ID.</p>
