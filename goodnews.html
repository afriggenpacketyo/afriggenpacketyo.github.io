          <p>British singer Lola Young, 24, has reassured fans she is recovering after collapsing on stage during her performance at the All Things Go Festival in New York. The incident, captured in social media videos, occurred while she was performing her song "Conceited." Young had previously told the audience she was dealing with a "sensitive matter" and had cancelled another show a day earlier. Following the collapse, fellow performer Doechii led the crowd in a chant of support for the "Messy" singer, who is a rising star from the Brit School.</p>

          <p>Iraqi President Abdullatif Jamal Rashid has declared his country "100% safe and secure," signaling a new phase focused on infrastructure and economic development as U.S. troops prepare to draw down. In an interview, Rashid emphasized Iraq's desire for independence in its decision-making, balancing relationships with both the United States and Iran. While he downplayed the influence of Iranian-aligned militias and stated ISIS cells are no longer a major threat, some U.S. commanders and analysts express concern that a premature withdrawal could create a security vacuum. Rashid is focused on attracting foreign investment to rebuild the nation after decades of conflict.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is pioneering a new industrial model, termed a "pull" system, to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of car manufacturing. This approach inverts the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. Under the new model, the final assembly stage pulls components from suppliers only as they are needed, aiming to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method is crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry, which is projected to see exponential growth in orbital launches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores close and shopping center vacancy rates rise, small and local business owners are finding unprecedented opportunities to lease prime commercial real estate. According to a Cushman & Wakefield report, the national vacancy rate for shopping centers increased to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2025, softening demand and slowing rent growth. This has allowed independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate more favorable terms, such as flexible lease lengths and lower rents. While the trend varies by geography, it marks a significant shift, allowing local entrepreneurs to revitalize spaces once exclusively occupied by large corporations.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems for repeatedly promoting false claims about the company's machines following the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement, filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, remain confidential. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a key figure in spreading conspiracy theories alleging the election was rigged. This marks Dominion's third major settlement over election lies, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News in 2023 and a $67 million settlement with Newsmax, holding purveyors of the misinformation financially accountable for their statements.</p>

          <p>David Kaczynski, who turned his brother Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) in to the FBI, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of Ted's bombs in 1987. After Ted's capture, David felt immense guilt and began reaching out to his brother's victims to apologize. This led to a connection with Wright, and over the years, the two have traveled together, sharing their story of reconciliation and healing from shared trauma. Their bond demonstrates that compassion can emerge from profound violence, offering a message of hope and the possibility of finding peace across seemingly insurmountable divides.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain limiting beliefs prevent many people from increasing their earnings, even when they desire to do so. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to make more money, which creates shame and prevents them from seeking help or learning new skills like salary negotiation. Another is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and consistent effort. Finally, the tendency to procrastinate by telling oneself they will start "later" is a major obstacle, as the perfect time never arrives and prevents meaningful action.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan at the party's annual conference, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The initiative is a core component of Labour's ambitious goal to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments, aiming to create entire communities, not just housing units.</p>

Recent social media images show that covers have been removed from the ship's electromagnetic catapults, a system ideal for launching unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This vessel is considered a significant asset for the PLA Navy, capable of expanding the operational range and power of its strike groups. Such ships are expected to play a critical role in any potential military conflict involving Taiwan, which Beijing views as a renegade province.</p>

However, if an individual feels energized by these difficulties and views them as opportunities for personal growth, they likely have the resilience needed to succeed. Goodwin's own journey involved an earlier failed beverage venture before he and his partner launched Olipop, which is now valued at $1.85 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American expatriate who helps others move abroad has identified several common misconceptions about relocating to another country. Contrary to popular belief, living abroad is not always cheap, as costs like housing are rising globally. Another myth is that Americans are unwelcome; in reality, anti-tourism sentiment is often about affordable housing shortages, not expats who integrate. While loneliness is a concern, communities can form quickly, though deep friendships take time. The idea that life abroad is a perfect escape is also false, as bureaucracy and personal challenges still exist, and it is important to remember that one's first move doesn't have to be permanent.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing threat of fires in cities, the United States has made remarkable progress in fire safety over the last four decades. Since 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate has decreased by approximately two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This success is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinkler systems. Other key factors include the implementation of safer furnishing standards, a major decline in cigarette smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes, all of which have combined to make buildings far less vulnerable.</p>
