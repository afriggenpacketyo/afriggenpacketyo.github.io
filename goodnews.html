          <p>In a compelling match on Wimbledon's Court One, British tennis player Cameron Norrie staged a comeback to defeat American twelfth-seed Frances Tiafoe. Norrie won the four-set thriller 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, advancing to the third round for the second time in his career. The victory provided a boost for British tennis fans, especially after compatriot Katie Boulter was unexpectedly knocked out by a lower-ranked opponent. Following the match, Norrie expressed his joy at playing in the special atmosphere of his favorite court and his satisfaction with his high level of play.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century, helping his team reach 310-5 by the close of the first day of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. Despite England's captain Ben Stokes choosing to bowl first on a flat pitch, India established a solid position, largely thanks to Gill's unflustered performance and an elegant 87 from opener Yashasvi Jaiswal. England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, battled hard and took key wickets to prevent India from completely dominating the day. The tourists will be content but recognize there is still significant work to do to secure a commanding first-innings total.</p>

          <p>British university student and qualifier Ollie Tarvet's remarkable Wimbledon journey concluded with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 loss to two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court. Despite the defeat, the 733rd-ranked Tarvet put up an entertaining fight, creating eleven break point opportunities and showing significant potential against the world number two. Alcaraz praised his opponent's performance, acknowledging the difficulty of a Centre Court debut. Tarvet's successful run through qualifying and the first round has significantly raised his profile, though he plans to return to his university studies in the United States.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions' tour in Australia is providing a clearer picture of the potential Test team, following a decisive 52-12 victory over the Queensland Reds.

However, the team suffered a setback with an arm injury to the versatile and in-form Elliot Daly, creating uncertainty at the fullback position. The match also highlighted the intense competition for spots, with players like Jac Morgan impressing while others struggled to make their case for selection ahead of the first Test.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, the Fort Lauderdale Police Bomb Squad conducted a public safety demonstration to highlight the dangers of fireworks. The squad used explosives similar to an M-80 on items like a watermelon and a paint can to show the potential for serious harm to the human body. This educational effort comes as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports a significant increase in fireworks-related injuries and deaths, with 11 fatalities and an estimated 14,700 injuries in the past year. Officials are urging the public to exercise extreme caution with all types of fireworks, including sparklers.</p>

          <p>Researchers are launching a new expedition to solve the 88-year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance, spurred by a potential clue from a satellite image. The image appears to show an object the size of Earhart's Lockheed Electra aircraft on Nikumaroro, a remote island in the South Pacific, near where some of her emergency radio transmissions were thought to have originated. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing a team to travel to the island in November to investigate the site. While some experts are skeptical, the mission leaders believe this is the best opportunity yet to finally close the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the economic landscape shifting, savers with a significant sum like $10,000 should carefully consider their options, such as a certificate of deposit (CD). Before committing funds, it's crucial to determine whether a short-term or long-term CD is more advantageous, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. Savers must also realistically assess if they can afford to have a large amount of money locked away for the entire term, as early withdrawal penalties can be substantial. Finally, one should compare CD rates and terms against high-yield savings and money market accounts, which offer comparable returns with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks connected to the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) experienced a significant surge, driven by renewed market enthusiasm for stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets. Companies that have adopted an ETH-focused treasury strategy, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, saw their stock prices jump dramatically. This interest is fueled by Ethereum's capability to support smart contracts, making it a key platform for creating digital representations of traditional assets. The trend follows Robinhood's announcement of tokenized stock trading in Europe and BlackRock's successful tokenized money market fund, both built on the Ethereum network. (not investment advice)</p>

These "bonus meals" are designed to boost morale and help astronauts feel connected to home. Chef Pic, who holds 10 Michelin stars, called the project an "exhilarating challenge" that pushes the boundaries of gastronomy into the extraterrestrial realm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists have sequenced the entire genome of an ancient Egyptian, revealing new insights into the ancestry of people from the Old Kingdom period. The DNA, extracted from a man who lived around 4,700 years ago, showed that 80% of his genetic material came from North Africa, while a surprising 20% traced back to West Asia and Mesopotamia. This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections between ancient Egypt and the Fertile Crescent. The man's remains, unusually well-preserved in a sealed clay pot, have provided the oldest Egyptian DNA sample ever fully sequenced.</p>

Parchman explained that he wrote the book to provide a resource for men, who are a factor in at least 30% of infertility cases but often lack support. He shared the shock of his diagnosis and the feeling of being the "weakest link," emphasizing the importance of open communication and vulnerability. The book aims to help men navigate the emotional challenges of IVF and break the stigma surrounding male fertility issues.</p>
