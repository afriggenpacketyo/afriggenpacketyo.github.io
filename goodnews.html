          <p>This article discusses the potential earnings from an 18-month certificate of deposit (CD) in the current interest rate environment of June 2025. Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, 18-month CDs can still provide substantial returns for savers. The article provides examples of how much can be earned with different deposit amounts and interest rates, ranging from $1,000 to $20,000. It also highlights the benefits of opening an 18-month CD, including protection against market uncertainty and more favorable rates compared to alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>Alex Warren's hit song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, making it the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017.

Despite its success, changing media habits mean "Ordinary" hasn't become a ubiquitous phenomenon like previous long-running hits. Warren, who found fame on TikTok, has seen his career explode with "Ordinary," which is also number one in the US. This is a report on music chart success.</p>
