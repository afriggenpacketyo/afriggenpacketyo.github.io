          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, initially due to an oxygen leak and then because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission aims to demonstrate critical fixes and upgrades after three previous catastrophic failures this year. Elon Musk acknowledged thousands of engineering challenges, especially perfecting orbital refueling, which is essential for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and future Mars missions. Despite delays, NASA's acting administrator expressed optimism about SpaceX's ability to overcome these hurdles.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding, which had been frozen, after facing a lawsuit from California and 22 other states. These congressionally allocated funds are crucial for after-school programs, teacher training, and support for English learners, impacting approximately 1.4 million children. While a White House spokesperson had previously suggested the funds were misused for a "radical left-wing agenda," the states argued the withholding was illegal under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. California's Attorney General, Rob Bonta, hailed the agreement as a victory for students.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Fire Department crews successfully halted a brush fire that scorched approximately nine acres in Sherman Oaks on Monday afternoon. While the fire's progression was stopped, full containment requires heavy equipment to extinguish burned material, leading to warnings of extended operations and potential traffic delays on the 405 Freeway. No injuries were reported in the incident. This fire coincides with an ongoing 10.2-mile repavement project on the 405, further impacting local commuters.</p>
