          <h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Driven by Fear of Failure, Biographer Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 10:13:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to his biographer Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading a company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, is significantly motivated by a fear of failure. Witt, who interviewed Huang for six hours, notes that this anxiety fuels Huang's drive and work ethic, pushing him to avoid letting people down. Huang's unusual discomfort when things are going well distinguishes him from other CEOs, who are often motivated by more positive emotions. While an Nvidia spokeswoman declined to comment, Witt's observations provide insight into the mindset of one of the world's most successful leaders.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people from the city center on Wednesday to allow experts to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation is one of the largest of its kind in the city since the war, with a significant portion of the old city, including hotels, care homes, and Rhine bridges, being cleared. The bombs, of US manufacture, were discovered in the Deutz district, leading to widespread disruptions in transportation and daily life as the city worked to ensure public safety during the disposal process.</p>

          <p>According to a court filing in Wisconsin, an inmate admitted to writing letters threatening President Donald Trump in an attempt to frame Ramon Morales-Reyes, a migrant who was in jail with him. The inmate, Demetric Deshawn Scott, allegedly wanted Morales-Reyes deported to prevent him from testifying in an upcoming trial. Scott reportedly confessed to officials that he wrote the letters himself, knowing that including Trump would involve the Secret Service. Morales-Reyes, who was initially accused by the DHS, submitted a handwriting sample that did not match the letters.</p>

          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on organized retail crime resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states last week.

Authorities emphasized that the focused effort sends a deterrent message to criminals. Retailers have reported significant increases in shoplifting incidents and associated losses in recent years, prompting increased law enforcement efforts and calls for stricter enforcement and felony thresholds.</p>

          <p>CDs offer an opportunity to earn higher returns than standard savings accounts, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average CD rates range from 1.70% to 2.00%, top CDs currently offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41%. To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which typically offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Also, explore short-term CDs, as the inverted yield curve means they often have higher interest rates than longer-term options (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, "And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America," makes a compelling argument for recognizing housing as a human right. Foscarinis examines the systemic failures that perpetuate homelessness, dismantling the myth that it is primarily a result of personal failings. The book highlights the need for policy changes, such as the "Housing First" model, and emphasizes the importance of political will to address the crisis effectively. Ultimately, the author asserts that homelessness is a societal choice and advocates for a future where it no longer exists.</p>
