          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers involved in transporting platforms for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo's true nature. According to Zelenskyy, the drones were concealed in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were remotely opened to conduct the attack. He emphasized that Ukraine used only its own weapons in the operation, avoiding the deployment of equipment from allied nations. The attack reportedly damaged over 40 Russian bombers, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson's return to the England cricket team after two years signals a shift towards dependability and experience. Despite being a leading English spinner in the County Championship, Dawson was previously overlooked for international selection. Under the new captain Harry Brook, England has realized the value of Dawson's consistency and reliability. His inclusion reflects a broader strategy to improve England's bowling of left-arm spin after three poor white-ball tournaments.</p>

          <p>The origins of Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish, are debated, with some suggesting it began as an English joke. While some credit poor farmers using cheese as a meat substitute, others believe English pubs coined the name to mock the Welsh for not affording rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves asserts rarebit is associated with Welsh culture, with cheese being a vital part of Welsh diets for centuries. Various theories exist, but the dish remains a popular and nostalgic comfort food.</p>
