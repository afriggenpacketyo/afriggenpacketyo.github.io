          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert introduces a new framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This style encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. It involves doing internal work, creating a safe environment for expressing emotions, embracing the whole child, and leading with calm authority. The author suggests that emotional safety is often missing in homes because parents were not taught how to create a safe space during emotional storms.</p>

          <p>Americans across the country are commemorating George Floyd five years after his death at the hands of police, with gatherings in Houston and Minneapolis. Floyd's murder sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. However, what many hailed as a national "reckoning" with racism seems to be fading. Commemorations include church services, candlelight vigils, and speeches, aiming to remember Floyd and continue the work toward racial justice.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after his truck was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he missed three payments because he changed banks and forgot to update his automatic payments. He found out about the repossession when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage for packages. Paul has since regained his truck, describing the experience as "definitely a funny experience."</p>

          <p>Since President Trump's embrace of the new Syrian leader, Israeli airstrikes on the country have subsided, complicating Israel's military strategy. After the fall of Bashar al-Assad, Israel launched numerous attacks on Syria to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands. However, Trump's recent meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have altered the situation.

          <p>Career coach Kendall Berg shares insights from her new book, "Secrets of the Career Game," which outlines strategies for career success that combine pursuing promotions and higher pay with finding fulfilling work. She emphasizes the importance of choosing where and how to play the career game intentionally and strategically, and knowing when not to play. Berg argues that career progression is not solely based on merit but also on developing soft skills and building relationships (not investment advice).

In the end, the race was about speed and not about crashes, and the drivers' skill played a key role.</p>
