          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is poised to sign an executive order, authorizing pharmacists to prescribe and administer COVID-19 vaccines, thereby ensuring swift and convenient healthcare access for all New Yorkers. This decisive action is a direct response to ongoing federal regulatory uncertainties and political debates surrounding vaccine availability, which have led to inconsistent access at pharmacies. The temporary order is designed to provide immediate, seamless access to immunizations while the Governor actively works with the Legislature to establish a comprehensive, long-term solution. This move firmly positions New York to protect its residents' health decisions against any political interference.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are poised for gains as investors keenly anticipate the U.S. August jobs report, a key indicator for potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. Earlier in the week, global markets experienced a sell-off driven by concerns over government debt and fiscal policies, but sentiment rebounded on Thursday. Recent U.S. payroll data boosted market confidence for a September rate cut, mitigating fears of a severe economic downturn. All attention is now on whether Friday's jobs report will present a "Goldilocks" reading, signaling a labor market soft enough to justify rate cuts. Meanwhile, British retail sales and house prices have also shown positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Kingdom retail sales volumes experienced a 0.6% increase in July, exceeding economic predictions, largely attributed to favorable sunny weather and the popularity of the women's Euro football tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) released these figures after a two-week delay, having faced recent scrutiny regarding the accuracy of its data. While July showed a positive monthly trend, sales over the three months leading to July were down by 0.6% compared to the preceding quarter. Initial strong performance in supermarkets, sports shops, and household goods has since moderated, though this was somewhat counterbalanced by a rise in online and clothing sales.</p>

          <p>Italy is becoming a prime destination for the ultra-wealthy, defying a global trend of stricter regulations on the super-rich, thanks to its appealing flat-tax regime and booming real estate market. Despite doubling its one-off charge on foreign income to 200,000 euros in 2024, demand for luxury living and Milan's vibrant business scene remains strong. Milan, in particular, has seen property prices surge by 49% since the flat-tax regime's 2017 introduction, far outpacing other major Italian cities. This influx of high-net-worth individuals, estimated at 3,600 this year, is sparking new businesses and job creation, although critics raise concerns about worsening wealth inequality.

          <p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai publicly expressed gratitude to President Donald Trump following a favorable antitrust ruling that spared Alphabet from a breakup in a significant case initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice. A U.S. District Judge decided against imposing the most severe penalties for Google's established monopoly in internet search, which subsequently boosted Alphabet's market capitalization by $230 billion. Pichai acknowledged the Trump administration's "constructive dialogue" and its focus on maintaining U.S. leadership in artificial intelligence, despite the historical context of the lawsuit. This outcome allows Google to prioritize its advancements in AI, aligning with the administration's "Winning the AI Race" initiative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine President Javier Milei is actively working to unlock the nation's significant copper potential, aiming to leverage the surging global demand for the metal driven by the push towards electrification and renewable energy. Central to his "Make Argentina Great Again" economic revitalization efforts is the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI), which offers generous tax, trade, and foreign exchange benefits to large-scale investors over a 30-year period. This policy has already drawn interest from major players like BHP, Glencore, and Rio Tinto, with copper projects alone projected to attract $16 billion. Experts view Argentina as a promising new frontier for copper, though sustained success hinges on policy consistency and social acceptance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, the recently retired Chief of the Defence Staff, has affirmed that the United Kingdom's national security remains robust "for now and for the next few years." His confidence stems from the UK's nuclear capabilities, its integral role within NATO—described as "the biggest and strongest gun club ever"—and its crucial alliance with the United States. Sir Tony commended the previous government under Boris Johnson for its firm and unwavering support for Ukraine following the 2022 invasion, marking a stronger stance compared to earlier conflicts. He also expressed skepticism about the formation of a new non-NATO "axis," highlighting the absence of deep historical trust among such nations.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that most bidders vying for a stake in Starbucks' China operations have submitted proposals that value the business at an impressive figure of up to US$5 billion. If finalized, this transaction would represent one of the most substantial divestments by a global consumer company within the Chinese market in recent memory. The submitted offers generally reflect a valuation of roughly 10 times Starbucks China's projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) for 2025, which stands between US$400 million and US$500 million. This strategic sale is being pursued as Starbucks navigates challenges of sluggish growth and fierce competition from domestic brands in China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles initiated their Super Bowl title defense by securing a 24-20 victory against the Dallas Cowboys in a tumultuous NFL season opener. The game quickly became notable when Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into play for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, an incident Carter later acknowledged as a regrettable "mistake." Despite this early disciplinary issue and a lengthy 65-minute lightning delay in the third quarter, Jalen Hurts propelled the Eagles with two crucial rushing touchdowns. Philadelphia ultimately navigated through several self-inflicted penalties and moments of undisciplined play, while Dallas struggled to convert key opportunities into points.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, following another drawing without a top prize winner. This article delves into Powerball data, detailing the daunting odds of winning the jackpot at 1 in 292.2 million, and critically examining how state-level income taxes dramatically affect the net payout for winners. Individuals in states such as California, Florida, and Texas, which do not impose taxes on lottery prizes, could potentially receive over $1 billion via annuity or $485 million as a lump sum after federal taxes. In contrast, winners in states with higher taxes, like New York and Minnesota, would see their take-home amount significantly reduced. (not investment advice)</p>
