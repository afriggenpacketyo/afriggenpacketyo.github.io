          <p>The recent handsy behavior between "Fantastic Four" actors Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is part of a broader Hollywood trend where co-stars use physical chemistry to generate buzz for their projects. While Pascal attributes his use of physical touch to managing anxiety, public relations experts suggest such actions are often a calculated tactic to build hype for a film. This promotional strategy, also seen with actors like Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey, can be effective but also risks public scrutiny if it is perceived as inauthentic or inappropriate.</p>

          <p>China's top manufacturing regulator plans to tighten oversight in key sectors like electric vehicles and solar power to address excessive and low-quality competition. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced it will use upgraded standards to phase out outdated production capacity and consolidate the results of its crackdown on "neijuan," or intense internal competition. This move is part of a broader government effort to regulate cut-price competition and promote higher-quality, hi-tech goods to stimulate domestic demand and ensure healthier industry development.

          <p>World Rugby's chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has rejected claims from Australia's coach, Joe Schmidt, that a crucial refereeing decision in the second Test against the British and Irish Lions compromised player welfare. The controversy surrounds a clearout by Lions flanker Jac Morgan that led to the match-winning try, a call which the on-field officials and TMO upheld. Gilpin defended the officials, stating they operate under immense pressure and that the organization is heavily invested in balancing the sport's physicality with player safety.</p>

          <p>South Korean AI chip developer Rebellions has secured a new investment from tech giant Samsung as it prepares for a major funding round and a future initial public offering. The startup, which designs chips for AI inferencing, is aiming to raise between $150 million and $200 million to challenge industry leader Nvidia. This strategic partnership is also a potential win for Samsung's chip manufacturing division, which is producing Rebellions' next-generation chip and looking to expand its foundry business.

          <p>Google is rolling out a new "AI Mode" search feature in the UK, offering users an alternative to the traditional list of links by providing conversational, AI-generated answers. This significant change, powered by Google's Gemini platform, will exist alongside the classic search format but has raised concerns among publishers and businesses who rely on search traffic for revenue. While Google suggests the tool will unlock new ways for users to find information, critics worry it will reduce clicks to external websites, potentially disrupting existing business models.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest the recent EU-U.S. trade deal could indirectly benefit the U.K. economy due to differing tariff rates. The agreement imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods entering the U.S., while the U.K. faces a lower 10% levy, potentially making British exports more competitive. This tariff differential could incentivize U.S. firms to source more goods from Britain and may even prompt some EU manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to avoid the higher duties, creating a potential economic upside for the post-Brexit nation.
