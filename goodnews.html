          <p>The article reports that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first official meeting with the families of the 50 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, reaffirming the Trump administration's commitment to securing their release. During the meeting in Washington, D.C., the families stressed the urgent need for a single, comprehensive deal to bring all remaining captives home at once. They expressed their trust in the administration's ability to act decisively. The meeting included relatives of hostages and a recently released captive, Iair Horn, whose brother remains in captivity.</p>

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II military posture, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending to build what it intends to be Europe's strongest armed force. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and war on the continent, the German government will raise its defense budget to 3.5% of GDP, a move requiring a constitutional change to its 'debt brake.' This significant policy shift is being financed by a special fund of over $100 billion, signaling a profound change in the nation's strategic and cultural approach to military power.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques conservative gay figures, like Richard Grenell, for promoting respectability politics and attempting to create a divide within the LGBTQ+ community by marginalizing its more flamboyant and gender-nonconforming members. The author argues that the true spirit of the gay rights movement has always been rooted in diversity and the courage of those who defied norms, such as the drag queens who initiated the Stonewall Riots. The piece asserts that progress for queer people has never come from a monolithic group of heteronormative men, and that this diversity is what makes the movement worthy of pride.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political rebuke, voters in traditionally conservative Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public libraries from a MAGA-aligned city council. The measures reversed a council decision to create a parent review board for children's books and barred the privatization of the library system. This victory for the 'Protect HB' coalition is presented as a case study in how a nonpartisan, grassroots movement can successfully push back against political overreach, even in a conservative stronghold, by focusing on shared community values and mobilizing a diverse group of concerned citizens.</p>

The unique performance utilized the building's varied acoustics and changing sunset light, creating a dynamic experience for attendees. The event demonstrated the new space's potential not just for visual art but as a major venue for performance, echoing the museum's musical inauguration in 1965.</p>

The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors.

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the Iran-Israel conflict, arguing that it was a rare moment of perceived authenticity from a world leader. The author suggests that while swearing doesn't equate to honesty, the public's distrust of polished, scripted political speech makes such unvarnished moments resonate. The article posits that in an era of spin, a well-placed, genuine curse can cut through the noise and convey a level of frustration that sanitized diplomatic language cannot, potentially making politicians seem more human and relatable to the public.</p>

However, pressing challenges remain, including a logjam of unfinished trade deals ahead of a self-imposed deadline and the uncertain fate of his "one big beautiful bill" containing his tax and immigration agenda, which faces hurdles in the Senate.

          <p>According to a chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China possesses a significant "comparative advantage" in the global development of stablecoins due to its mature digital payment ecosystem. The research suggests that platforms like WeChat and Alipay already operate in a manner similar to stablecoins, functioning as extensions of legal tender with a 1:1 peg to fiat currency. This existing infrastructure, combined with a relatively advanced regulatory framework, could provide China with a crucial head start in the increasingly important field of platform-based digital money.
