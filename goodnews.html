          <p>An opinion piece describes a post-pandemic China that is more open and welcoming to foreigners, contrasting it with the perception of an "angry America." The author recounts their experience obtaining a visa and traveling to China, noting the simplified application process and the friendly atmosphere upon arrival. This perspective challenges warnings of increasing authoritarianism and arbitrary detention, suggesting a shift in China's approach to international relations. The author's experience suggests a different narrative of China than the one often portrayed in Western media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1 across the UK. Families and private schools argued that the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law, particularly for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The court found that the government was aware of the potential impact on some families but was entitled to prioritize revenue generation for public services. The government estimates the policy will raise ¬£1.8 billion annually to support pupils in state schools.</p>

          <p>Christy Walton, a Walmart heiress, placed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times promoting the "No Kings" protest against President Trump, planned for June 14. The ad lists declarations emphasizing values such as honoring commitments, defending against dictators, and supporting a healthy economy. The protest is scheduled to coincide with a military parade in Washington, D.C., and aims to challenge what it calls the increasing authoritarian excesses of the Trump administration. Walmart distanced itself from the ad, stating that it was not connected to or endorsed by the company.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for an end to the windfall tax on oil and gas companies, known as the Energy Profits Levy, arguing it should be scrapped before its current 2030 expiration. Speaking at the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh, Badenoch claimed the tax is harming the oil and gas industry. She also advocated for issuing new licenses for drilling in the North Sea to ensure energy security. Badenoch criticized Labour's extension of the tax and pledged that a Tory government would remove the ban on new licenses.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert identifies the phrase "You should step it up" as one that dads often dislike hearing on Father's Day, suggesting instead to acknowledge their importance and offer support. The expert emphasizes that no father dreams of being away from their child and that parenting is a team sport requiring support systems. He also highlights that every dad wants to do their best and that fostering a culture of compassion can make a significant difference in their lives. Recent studies show the profound effects parental separation has on children, but separated parents always want the best for their children.</p>

          <p>Summer Fridays, once a popular perk, are becoming increasingly rare as companies shift to more flexible work arrangements. The rise of work-from-home Fridays has diminished the need for shortened workweeks, according to experts. However, employees still highly value summer Fridays as a way to prevent burnout, boost morale, and improve retention. Despite their popularity, most workers are not offered any summer-specific benefits, even though many believe those benefits improve productivity.</p>

          <p>While fans may root for the star-studded Dodgers, MLB owners are more interested in the cost-conscious approach of the Angels. The Angels are rebuilding by drafting polished college stars capable of quickly reaching the majors, avoiding heavy investment in scouting and player development. This strategy, while not proven to guarantee winning seasons, could embolden owners to eliminate more minor league teams. The Angels' approach contrasts with the Dodgers' reliance on expensive acquisitions like Ohtani and Betts.</p>

          <p>Rare earth elements (REEs) are crucial for various modern technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, smartphones, and defense systems. These 17 chemical elements are not necessarily rare in occurrence but are challenging to find in high enough concentrations for financially viable extraction. China currently dominates the mining and processing of REEs, raising concerns in Western nations about future access. The US and EU are taking steps to build internal supplies of critical materials to reduce dependence on China.</p>
