          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose almost 12% of their body weight in a 72-week late-stage trial. While the results were slightly below some Wall Street expectations, causing the company's stock to drop, the pill is still seen as a significant development. As a more convenient and easier-to-manufacture oral alternative to popular injectables like Wegovy, it could greatly expand patient access. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year, potentially launching it globally by next year.</p>

          <p>The probability of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller becoming the next Fed chair has surpassed 50% on the prediction market Kalshi, making him the new front-runner. This surge followed reports that President Trump's advisors are impressed with Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than just current data. Waller, who recently dissented against the Fed's decision to hold rates steady, has overtaken previous favorites Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett. President Trump has frequently criticized current Chair Jerome Powell for maintaining high interest rates.</p>

          <p>In The Hundred cricket competition, the Northern Superchargers secured a commanding 47-run victory over Welsh Fire at Headingley. After posting a total of 141-4, the Superchargers' bowlers dismantled the Fire's lineup, dismissing them for just 94 runs, their lowest-ever total. Australian all-rounder Georgia Wareham was the star player, contributing with both bat and ball and playing a role in two run-outs. The decisive win provides the Superchargers with a significant net run-rate boost, placing them at the top of the league table.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency, private equity, and real estate in 401(k) retirement plans. This move could open up trillions of dollars in retirement funds to new, and potentially riskier, investment classes that have traditionally been excluded due to high fees and lack of transparency. The order is considered a major victory for the alternative asset industry, which has been pushing for greater access to the defined contribution plan market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains that cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have become a popular method for long-term investors to gain exposure to digital assets without the complexity of holding them directly. Following pro-crypto moves from the Trump administration, these funds have seen record inflows, led by products like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust. The article cautions investors to distinguish between standard ETFs that track a token's price and riskier leveraged ETFs, which are designed for short-term trading and can multiply losses. For stable, long-term investing, non-leveraged funds are presented as the more suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The global oil market is reacting with skepticism to President Trump's threats to impose "secondary tariffs" on countries like India and China that purchase Russian energy exports. Traders appear to believe the threats are a negotiating tactic ahead of a Friday ceasefire deadline for Russia, rather than a policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts suggest that enforcing steep tariffs would risk driving global energy prices higher, which would contradict Trump's stated goal of lowering oil prices. The market's calm response indicates a belief that a deal will be reached or the tariffs will be minimal. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Tim Cook made the announcement alongside President Trump, highlighting a $2.5 billion expansion for Corning, which produces glass for iPhones and Apple Watches in the U.S. This significant investment is viewed by market analysts as a strategic move by Apple to align with the administration's goals, mitigate tariff impacts, and shift the narrative away from the company's perceived delays in its artificial intelligence strategy.</p>

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are presented as a way to adjust exposure to entire sectors or regions. Sectors like utilities and financials, which are more U.S.-based and service-oriented, are seen as less exposed to tariff impacts compared to materials and industrials that rely heavily on global supply chains.

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic makes the case that the societal decline in politeness, especially in online interactions, is detrimental to individual happiness and well-being. The author posits that being courteous—even when interacting with non-humans like AI bots—is a prosocial behavior that can elevate one's own mood and lower anger. The article suggests that consciously adopting habits of politeness, renouncing sarcasm, and responding to rudeness with courtesy can serve as a powerful tool for improving personal mental state in an increasingly coarse culture.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable has developed headphones integrated with a brain-computer interface that uses electroencephalography (EEG) sensors to measure the wearer's focus. The technology analyzes electrical signals from the brain to determine attention levels in real-time and can prompt the user to take a break when focus wanes. While the current product is geared toward improving productivity, the company envisions future applications in monitoring brain health, potentially offering early detection for conditions like depression or Alzheimer's disease. The article also touches upon the technology's privacy implications and potential.</p>
