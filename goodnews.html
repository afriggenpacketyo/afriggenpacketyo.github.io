        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. This has put the spotlight on bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Corporate momentum and adoption by Wall Street have also contributed to the climb, with inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin's price surpassing $40 billion. On-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of Congressional representatives is urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline the government‚Äôs visa processing system for the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Concerns have been raised that proposed cost-cutting measures could increase visa wait times, potentially impacting attendance and economic activity. The 2026 World Cup, expected to generate $3.75 billion in economic activity in the U.S., relies on the State Department's ability to efficiently process visa applications for spectators, athletes, and media.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has responded to a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into whether the city's hiring practices are discriminatory, calling it an attack on diversity.

He compared his administration to the Trump administration, which has targeted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.</p>
