          <h2>Government Fast-Tracks New Reservoirs to Secure Water Supply Amid Climate Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 21:49:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has fast-tracked two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire to bolster England's water supplies, declaring them "nationally significant" to expedite the planning process. These projects aim to increase resilience against future droughts, particularly in dry regions with high water demand, with completion targeted for 2036 and 2040, respectively. While the government intends to legislate to automatically make other proposed reservoirs "nationally significant," some experts caution that managing water usage and reducing waste should be prioritized alongside infrastructure development. Shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins blamed Labour's policies for pressures on water supplies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs imposed after beginning his second term are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The U.S. Court of International Trade's decision in V.O.S. Selections v. United States and Oregon v. Department of Homeland Security argues that Trump surpassed these limits and that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) cannot grant unlimited tariff authority. While the decision can be appealed, it argues that the tariffs do not address the nation's trade deficit and that they don't effectively deter drug trafficking. The court has issued a permanent injunction on a nationwide basis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are beginning to venture back into England from the south of Scotland after being absent for years, raising hopes that they might nest in the area. The resurgence is attributed to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which has translocated juvenile and sub-adult eagles from the Scottish Highlands. These eagles have also been sighted in the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. While it is too early to determine if they will settle permanently, this development marks a potentially exciting milestone for wildlife conservation.</p>

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning its attention to the Middle East, seeking to showcase progress toward landmark deals. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza is within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. Trump has also taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advising against striking Iranian nuclear facilities.

The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law, and directed the administration to end pauses on processing applications and parole extension requests.</p>

This comment refers to reserve rice from 2021 that the government plans to release to curb soaring prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi called the remark unfortunate, as the government is working on the best way to release the rice. Rice prices in Japan have hit a new record, increasing nearly 100% from the previous year.</p>
