          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reported that AI stocks have rebounded, suggesting Wall Street's concerns about Chinese startup DeepSeek surpassing leading tech companies were unfounded. He noted the resurgence of data center-related stocks like Nvidia and AMD, indicating renewed confidence in the AI sector's growth potential. Cramer argued that the market's initial panic over DeepSeek's capabilities caused investors to prematurely sell off tech stocks. Looking back, Cramer believes it is now evident that these stocks should not have been sold in the first place, as DeepSeek's impact proved less significant than initially feared.

Gang injunctions, which restrict suspected gang members' activities, have been challenged as overly broad and draconian.
