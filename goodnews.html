          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure company Nebius Group surged by 40% in premarket trading after announcing a multi-year, $19.4 billion deal with Microsoft. The Amsterdam-based firm, which spun out from Russian tech giant Yandex in 2023, will provide cloud computing power and graphics processing units (GPUs) for Microsoft's AI workloads through 2031. This agreement highlights the sustained high demand for the powerful computing equipment necessary for training and operating advanced AI systems. The news also positively impacted rival firms, underscoring investor confidence in the continued growth of the AI infrastructure sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The traditional "September surge," a post-summer increase in job market activity, may not materialize with its usual strength this year, according to career experts. While some recruiters note that companies often ramp up hiring in the fall to meet year-end goals and use remaining budgets, others are more cautious. Citing recession fears and a weak summer job market, some experts predict only a modest pickup compared to previous years. To prepare, job seekers are advised to update their LinkedIn profiles to match their resumes and to be strategic in their applications rather than applying indiscriminately.</p>

          <p>The price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, is currently valued at $3,633.31 per ounce as of September 8, 2025. This price is subject to constant fluctuation based on a variety of influential factors. Key drivers include basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty, all of which can increase investor interest in the precious metal. Additionally, movements in the U.S. dollar, changes in interest rates, and the policies of central banks holding gold reserves play a significant role in its day-to-day valuation.

          <h2>Experts Offer Strategies for Homeowners to Lower Monthly Mortgage Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 09:07:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, experts suggest several strategies for homeowners looking to reduce their monthly payments this fall. One option is refinancing to a lower interest rate, which is most effective if the new rate is at least 0.75% below the current one, though closing costs must be considered. Another less common strategy is a mortgage recast, where a lump-sum payment is made to reduce the principal balance, thereby lowering subsequent monthly payments without changing the interest rate. For those facing financial hardship, a loan modification with their servicer could provide relief by altering the loan's original terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Democratic state lawmaker and Presbyterian seminarian, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas currently held by Republican John Cornyn. Known for his eloquent, faith-based arguments against conservative policies, Talarico is seen by some Democrats as a promising figure who could potentially appeal to a broader electorate in the state. He frames his political positions as extensions of his Christian values, a strategy some believe could help the party reconnect with voters. Despite facing a tough primary and general election, his viral social media presence and unique profile have generated national attention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As competitors focus on value menus, Shake Shack is pursuing a strategy of offering premium, limited-time items with the launch of its new French Onion Menu. The new offerings include a French Onion Soup Burger, beer-battered onion rings, and Parmesan garlic fries, priced at a premium of $10.99. CEO Rob Lynch described this approach as the "democratization of fine dining," aiming to provide high-quality culinary experiences at a lower price point than traditional restaurants. This strategy follows the success of the company's high-priced Dubai Chocolate Pistachio Shake, which sold out quickly despite its cost.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to implement new binding targets aimed at significantly cutting waste from food and textiles by 2030. Member states will be required to reduce food waste from households, retailers, and restaurants by 30%, and waste from food processing by 10%. Additionally, the new rules will establish an "extended producer responsibility" scheme, making textile and footwear companies financially responsible for the collection, sorting, and recycling of their products. These measures are designed to combat the significant economic and environmental impact of the nearly 60 million tons of food and 12.6 million tons of textiles wasted annually in the bloc.</p>

According to its latest filing, StubHub's first-quarter revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $397.6 million, though its net loss also widened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed after 21 months in charge.
