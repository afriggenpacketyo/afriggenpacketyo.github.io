        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to suspend additional tariffs for 90 days as a result of successful trade talks, marking a significant easing of tensions between the two economic superpowers. Both countries have committed to reducing their reciprocal tariffs by a substantial percentage, providing room for further negotiations to address economic and trade relationship concerns. This agreement breaks an impasse that had brought trade between the two nations to a halt, with many American businesses suspending orders in anticipation of a resolution. The decision reflects a shared interest in a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic relationship, signaling a positive step towards defusing the trade war. Optimism among businesses is on the rise as a result of this development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Suffolk County in New York has approved a law that makes it a crime for convicted animal abusers to own pets, strengthening existing animal cruelty measures. The new law establishes a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail or a $1,000 fine, for those on the county's convicted animal abuser registry found to be owning pets. This expands upon a 2010 law that created the animal abuse registry, closing a loophole that previously lacked penalties for violating the pet ownership ban. County officials emphasized their commitment to protecting animals and prosecuting abusers, with the law taking effect shortly after dozens of dead cats were discovered in a Long Island home, underscoring the urgency of the new legislation.</p>

          <p>Serbia is witnessing a significant transformation driven by a student-led movement protesting against the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic. Sparked by a tragic train station collapse in Novi Sad, protests have grown into the largest and most extensive movement in recent years, reaching deep into Serbian society. The government's attempts to quell the unrest have been unsuccessful, with nearly half a million people filling the streets of Belgrade in March. Despite facing intimidation and threats, protesters are calling for early elections and seeking to raise international awareness of their struggle, demonstrating a remarkable display of solidarity and resilience.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group, has announced a historic decision to disband and disarm as part of a new peace initiative with Turkey, marking a potential end to a four-decade-long armed conflict. This decision follows calls from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to formally dissolve the group, a pivotal step toward ending the conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. The PKK stated that its struggle has brought the Kurdish issue to a point where it can be resolved through democratic politics, completing its historical mission.

The U.S. is set to impose fees on vessels owned or operated by companies in mainland China, Hong Kong, or Macau, as well as on Chinese-built vessels entering U.S. ports.

          <p>Wildlife experts are exploring the possibility of reintroducing elk to the East Midlands in the UK for the first time in approximately 3,000 years. The Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Wildlife Trusts have secured funding to conduct feasibility studies, viewing elk as a "keystone" species that can enhance habitats for other wildlife. The project will assess disease risks and engage with the public to garner support for the reintroduction. Initially, the elk would be kept in enclosures with beavers, eventually aiming to release them into wetland habitats along the Trent valley.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander, the last living captive with US nationality in Gaza, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. The decision comes ahead of President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East and aims to facilitate humanitarian aid entry into Gaza. The Israeli PM's office stated it had not committed to any ceasefire but only to a "safe corridor" for Alexander's release. President Trump confirmed Alexander's release, calling it "a step taken in good faith".</p>

          <p>Indian and Pakistani diplomats believe that while the new ceasefire deal over Kashmir was welcome, it will take a lot more to address the long-term distrust between the two countries. Experts from both sides spoke to DW. US mediation provided a useful off-ramp for both nations, according to diplomatic analysts from both countries. While the involvement of the US was important, Saudi Arabia and Iran also emerged as key mediators due to their strong economic and diplomatic ties with both India and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Many of Monday's papers are leading on the government's new plans to control the levels of migration into the UK. The Guardian says the prime minister is toughening rules in what it calls a "challenge to Reform [UK]", which inflicted losses on Labour in the recent local elections. It states that adults such as spouses, siblings, parents and grown-up children who accompany foreign workers to the UK will be expected to pass an English language test, while care homes will be prevented from recruiting staff from abroad. The Financial Times says Chinese companies are "accelerating a purge of foreign components" from their supply chains, and were "increasing efforts to source domestic inputs" to replace them with.</p>
