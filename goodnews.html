          <p>Rapper Sean Kingston, legally Kisean Paul Anderson, has been sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison for orchestrating a $1 million fraud scheme. Kingston and his mother leveraged his fame to acquire luxury goods, such as a bulletproof Escalade and high-end watches, without payment by using fraudulent wire receipts. Despite his apology in court, the judge ordered him into immediate custody. The scheme involved duping sellers between April 2023 and March 2024 by promising social media promotion in exchange for goods he never intended to pay for, leading to his arrest after a SWAT raid on his Florida mansion.</p>

          <p>A tech analyst has described potential U.S. government intervention in chipmaker Intel as "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson stated that such a move is necessary to revitalize Intel and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. The administration is reportedly considering using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the deal. The discussion highlights growing concerns about technological sovereignty, particularly with the rise of superintelligent AI, which some compare to nuclear proliferation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Department of Justice paralegal has been fired and charged with a felony after admitting to throwing a submarine sandwich at a federal agent in Washington, D.C. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the termination of Sean Dunn, who worked in the Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs. According to charging documents, Dunn yelled expletives at Customs and Border Patrol officers before throwing the sandwich at one officer's chest. Bondi framed the incident as an example of the "Deep State," vowing that disrespect for law enforcement would not be tolerated in the administration.</p>

Folds, who also wrote for a previous "Peanuts" special, finds depth in the characters, comparing the empathetic world of Charles M. Schulz to that of "Mister Rogers." The article also details his decision to step down as the National Symphony Orchestra’s artistic advisor at the Kennedy Center, a move he made to protest Donald Trump's influence there.

          <p>A parenting self-help book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" has been returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back from Oregon. A letter included with the book explained that the borrower was likely the man's grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for a U.S. Embassy job shortly after checking it out. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, waiving a potential fine estimated at nearly $900.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an American-made electric pickup truck with a minimalist design, intended to sell for roughly half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to offer a barebones base model, allowing owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories or even third-party add-ons. However, the vehicle's affordability is being challenged by the Trump administration's rollback of federal EV tax credits, which could raise its effective price from below $20,000 to nearly $28,000. This price increase places it in a more competitive market segment against established models like the Ford Maverick.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares rallied after a securities filing revealed that activist hedge fund Starboard Value had increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has sparked speculation of a renewed activist campaign, similar to the one in 2022-2023 that successfully pushed for greater efficiency and profitability, causing the stock to nearly double. Salesforce stock has struggled recently amid concerns that AI could disrupt its seat-based software license model. Analysts suggest Starboard's increased investment may pressure management to refocus on core growth and avoid dilutive acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in demonstrations against Atlanta's police training center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment for two and a half years. The attorney for Marsicano argued that the state was purposefully delaying the case, using the process itself as a form of punishment. This decision marks a significant victory for opponents of the controversial training facility, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO conspiracy indictments.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane early next week. As of Friday afternoon, the Category 1 storm was located east of the northern Leeward Islands and moving west-northwest. While people in the Caribbean are urged to monitor its progress due to potential heavy rain and dangerous surf, current forecast models show Erin curving northward. This path is expected to keep the storm well offshore of the U.S. East Coast, steered away by a high-pressure system and an approaching cold front.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves may offer significant health benefits beyond flavoring food, according to various research studies. Used in traditional medicine for centuries, cloves contain eugenol, a compound with antimicrobial properties that can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease. Studies also suggest that clove extract can help lower blood sugar levels after meals. Additionally, cloves are a source of essential minerals like calcium and magnesium and act as a natural antioxidant. However, eugenol can be an irritant and affect blood clotting, so concentrated clove oil should be used with caution.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Drake as "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake is suing the company, which is the parent label for both him and Kendrick Lamar, alleging defamation and that UMG secretly promoted Lamar's diss track "Not Like Us" to the detriment of his own career. In a court declaration, Grainge stated that the accusation makes no sense given UMG's investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in Drake's career and music rights. UMG's legal team further argued that the lawsuit's premise—that Drake could only lose a rap battle due to a corporate conspiracy—is absurd.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised as a "feel-bad, feel-good movie of the year" for its compelling and conclusive storytelling. The movie centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class and successfully avoids the common pitfall of leaving its central mystery unanswered. The article explores how the film provides a satisfying resolution by revealing the supernatural villain behind the events, leading to a cathartic and violent comeuppance. However, the review also notes that the film smartly underlines that vanquishing evil doesn't erase the trauma it caused, leaving the audience with a complex mix of triumph and sorrow.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force reveals his claims about crime are misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has dropped significantly in 2024. Data from D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department shows a 26% reduction in violent crime from August 2024 to August 2025. This downward trend aligns with national FBI statistics showing a decrease in violent crime across the U.S., a fact omitted from Trump's statements about an "out of control" crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article serves as an appreciation and introduction to the Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, prompted by a review of a new biography about her. The writer delves into Spark's best-known work, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," exploring its themes of mentorship, adolescence, and moral education. The novella focuses on a group of schoolgirls in 1930s Edinburgh and their charismatic but manipulative teacher. The analysis highlights Spark's use of an omniscient narrative and her central concern with faith, as the main character's journey culminates in a Catholic conversion, reflecting Spark's own life and providing a complex resolution to her teacher's influence.</p>
