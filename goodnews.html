          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has delivered a significant blow to the Trump administration's immigration policies by blocking the nationwide expansion of fast-track deportations. The ruling, citing critical due process concerns for migrants, pauses a January directive that broadened the expedited removal policy beyond border regions to include individuals present in the U.S. for up to two years. This decision, while likely to be appealed, represents a major legal setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, particularly those relying on the expanded expedited removal process. The court emphasized the necessity of affording due process to a large group of people now subject to these procedures, underscoring the importance of constitutional safeguards.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie has exited the US Open 2025 after a defeat by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, who advanced to the fourth round. Djokovic overcame a lower back injury to secure a 6-4 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3 victory, marking his seventh win against Norrie. Norrie admitted to being "a little overconfident" after breaking serve early in the third set, but Djokovic's improved serve and consistent play ultimately proved too strong. Despite the loss, Norrie expressed satisfaction with his season's progress, highlighting a positive shift in his career trajectory since earlier struggles this year.</p>

The brothers endured violent tropical storms, including one incident where Lachlan was swept overboard but was secured by a safety line. Beyond their athletic feat, the MacLeans have raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.

          <p>A 10-mile section of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after years of closures due to extensive storm and fire damage.

Approximately $7.9 million in repairs, including new guardrails and drainage systems, were implemented to restore the route. While the reopening provides crucial access to popular hiking trails, officials have issued extreme fire danger warnings for the Angeles National Forest, urging caution during the busy holiday period.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has delivered a significant legal victory by blocking the Trump administration's plan to terminate temporary protected status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The unanimous ruling upheld a lower court's decision, concluding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the statutory authority to revoke a prior TPS extension. This judgment provides a crucial win for plaintiffs who argued that the TPS statute was designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. While the DHS condemned the ruling, this article highlights a pathway for those who have already lost or are about to lose their protections.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Stanford Medicine indicates that young children aged 3 to 5 diagnosed with ADHD are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are attempted. The article highlights that approximately 68% of these children received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Clinical guidelines recommend initiating treatment with behavioral interventions due to potential side effects from medication, such as irritability and aggressiveness. Researchers are calling for further investigation into the appropriateness of early medication, emphasizing the need for a more cautious and balanced approach to ADHD treatment in preschoolers.</p>
