        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut has substantially lowered mortgage costs, with 30-year fixed rates falling to 6.13%. This reduction translates to monthly savings of over $600 on a $1 million mortgage compared to earlier this year, potentially saving over $200,000 in interest over the loan's lifetime. Improved affordability expands purchasing power for homebuyers and offers attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners. Experts anticipate further rate cuts, suggesting continued favorable market conditions for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer announced its acquisition of weight loss drugmaker Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, including future payments, marking a significant push into the burgeoning obesity drug market. This move follows Pfizer's previous setbacks in developing its own obesity drug candidates due to safety concerns. Metsera brings a promising pipeline of oral and injectable treatments, including a potential once-monthly GLP-1 drug, which analysts estimate could generate over $5 billion in peak annual sales. The deal is expected to close by year-end, positioning Pfizer to compete with existing market leaders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that a preliminary deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share." The agreement establishes TikTok's U.S. operations as a new joint venture with a majority American board, and Oracle will manage its security. This article clarifies that the deal addresses national security concerns stemming from the federal law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest or face a ban.</p>

          <p>When broiling fatty steaks, proper ventilation is crucial to manage smoke and prevent potential fire hazards, as rendered fat is highly flammable. This article emphasizes that high-fat cooking methods significantly increase particulate levels in the air, necessitating open windows or full extractor fans. Beyond safety, managing fat correctly allows it to baste the meat from within, imparting tenderness and depth of flavor. Techniques like patting the steak dry and generous seasoning contribute to optimizing the fat's contribution to the finished meal.</p>
