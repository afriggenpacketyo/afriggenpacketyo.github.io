          <p>The UK plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of a major defense review aimed at enhancing "warfighting readiness". The review includes a commitment to spend ¬£15 billion on its nuclear warhead program and ¬£1.5 billion to build six new factories for munitions production. The government also plans to build up to 7,000 long-range weapons and establish a "cyber and electromagnetic command" to improve military capabilities in cyberspace. These investments are projected to support 30,000 jobs and apprenticeships, signaling a significant boost to the UK's defense sector and technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>US tariffs and trade barriers are pushing Chinese technology companies to innovate and find new strategies to compete, according to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California. Faced with restrictions in the US market, these companies are focusing on cost-cutting measures and open-source collaborations, particularly in areas like AI and electric vehicles. Zhang anticipates that Chinese firms will aggressively pursue opportunities in other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and seek deeper trade relationships with Europe. The future remains uncertain, but Chinese firms are expected to face considerable challenges under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper's impressive performance at the French Open has caught the attention of his next opponent, Alexander Bublik, who described Draper's rise as "insane". Draper, who previously struggled on clay courts, has made significant strides this season, reaching his first clay final in Madrid. Bublik, on the other hand, experienced a rankings drop due to burnout, leading him to take a break in Las Vegas before returning to competition with renewed success. The upcoming match will determine who advances to the Grand Slam quarter-final.</p>
