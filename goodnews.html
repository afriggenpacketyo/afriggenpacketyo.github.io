        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Certain fruits, rich in natural hormones and minerals, can significantly improve sleep for Americans, according to board-certified dietitian Kendall Mackintosh. Tart cherries are highlighted for their high melatonin and tryptophan content, which help regulate circadian rhythms and promote sleep. Kiwi consumption has also been shown to improve sleep quality and duration in studies, particularly among elite athletes. Additionally, grapes, containing melatonin, are recommended as a beneficial, low-calorie evening snack when consumed in their natural, unprocessed form. Experts also advise reducing evening blue light exposure and maintaining a cool, dark bedroom for optimal sleep.</p>

          <p>Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard has set an unwanted Premier League record by being substituted before half-time in three consecutive starts, highlighting persistent injury woes. The 26-year-old Norwegian was withdrawn against West Ham due to a knee-to-knee collision, following earlier exits from games against Leeds and Nottingham Forest for recurring shoulder issues. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed significant concern, emphasizing Odegaard's crucial role as captain and attacking player. This string of injuries has hampered his season, forcing the team to constantly seek solutions for his absence and impacting their early-season form.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are expressing differing views on using cooling vests for the Singapore Grand Prix, which has been declared a 'heat hazard' due to extreme temperatures and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen strongly opposes mandatory use, citing discomfort from tubes and lack of cockpit space, insisting it should remain a driver's choice. In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the system, noting team improvements in car cooling despite the dry ice melting faster in hotter conditions. The article also touches on McLaren's championship lead, acknowledging that overtaking is difficult in Singapore, making qualifying crucial.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for diversity. His six-year term began on October 1, following his election in July, where he expressed hope that his presence would inspire others from diverse backgrounds. Curry, 53, previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod and aims to foster a more connected church, from local congregations to the hierarchy. The ELCA, which has seen its membership decline from 5.3 million in 1988 to 2.7 million today, also navigates theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion.</p>

          <h2>Costco to Offer Ozempic and Wegovy at Reduced Prices for Members Paying Out-of-Pocket</h2>

          <p>Costco has announced a new agreement with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to offer GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at approximately half the usual cost. Through the store’s prescription program, members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, specifically targeting those paying out-of-pocket due to limited insurance coverage. This initiative aims to increase access and affordability for these popular drugs, which have seen soaring prices and increasing supply limitations. The move could significantly boost demand and challenge the market for cheaper, compounded versions, expanding availability to a broader consumer base.</p>

          <p>The tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, one of the largest and most significant in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, has officially opened to the public in Luxor after a comprehensive two-decade-long Japanese-led restoration project. Dating back over 3,000 years, the site suffered severe deterioration, requiring incredibly delicate work from more than 260 specialists. The tomb features a 36-meter-long, 14-meter-deep passageway and main burial chambers for the king and queens Tiye and Sitamun. Its exquisite wall paintings are considered among the finest of the Eighteenth Dynasty, representing a major achievement in cultural preservation and offering new insights for visitors.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Dodgers' National League Division Series roster, marking his anticipated return to playoff action after being left off the wild-card round roster. Expected to pitch from the bullpen, Kershaw provides crucial left-handed depth to combat the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup, which includes several strong left-handed hitters. Fellow left-hander Anthony Banda also joins the pitching staff as part of an 11-man group. Catcher Will Smith remains active despite a fractured hand, though his starting status for Game 1 is uncertain. The Dodgers aim to leverage Kershaw's veteran presence and experience in what could be his final postseason series.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Rallies to Record Highs Despite Government Shutdown; Key Sectors See Gains</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market continued its rally this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new all-time highs, largely unaffected by the federal government shutdown, which Jim Cramer dismissed as a "non-event." Healthcare, utilities, and information technology sectors performed strongly, driven by factors such as President Trump's deal with Pfizer, the growing demand for AI data centers, and Nvidia's record highs. Notable stock movements included Nike's strong quarterly earnings, Boeing's production updates, and the trimming of Bristol Myers Squibb shares. Analysts made big calls on other stocks, but the market's overall resilience was a key takeaway. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise US Investors to Diversify Internationally Despite Domestic Market Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are strongly recommending that U.S. investors increase their exposure to international markets, citing a significant "home bias" that leaves many over-invested domestically. Despite record highs in U.S. stocks, analysts suggest better value can be found abroad, particularly in rapidly growing emerging markets like India and China. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF has seen a 35% gain this year, and India's NSE Nifty 50, while currently underperforming the U.S., has surged over 118% in the last five years. This advice aims to optimize returns and mitigate risks through strategic global diversification. (not investment advice)</p>
