          <p>Soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has reportedly become the first player in the sport's history to achieve a net worth of one billion dollars. His wealth was significantly boosted by a lucrative two-year contract with the Saudi Arabian team Al-Nassr FC, which is valued at over $400 million and is not subject to taxes. The 40-year-old athlete's financial status is also supported by numerous high-profile endorsement deals and his own CR7 brand, making his wealth predominantly driven by his salary and business ventures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emphasized that significant growth in energy production is fundamental to advancing artificial intelligence and ensuring continued economic expansion in the U.S. He stated that without more energy, there can be no industrial or economic growth, suggesting that AI data centers should become power generators themselves. In response, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified GE Vernova as a key company poised to benefit from this demand, citing its role in building natural gas turbines and small modular nuclear reactors to power the energy-intensive AI industry.

          <p>Comedian and actor Sir Lenny Henry is calling for the UK government to pay slavery reparations to all Black British people. In a new book, he supports the argument for compensatory payments totaling £18 trillion, stating that Black Britons personally deserve money for the lingering effects of slavery. While Commonwealth leaders have agreed to discuss reparatory justice, the UK government has maintained its position that it will not make financial payments, though other forms of amends like formal apologies or educational programs have been suggested.</p>

          <p>Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, has been awarded a MacArthur 'genius' grant for her research into how past societies in southwest Madagascar adapted to climate variability. By analyzing ancient artifacts, animal remains, and kitchen trash, Douglass has identified key survival strategies, including maintaining diverse social networks, flexible livelihoods, and mobility. Her work challenges the narrative that human arrival inevitably leads to environmental degradation and suggests these ancient practices hold valuable lessons for addressing today's climate challenges.</p>

The foundation also recognized his efforts in developing harm reduction programs, including a national network for distributing the overdose-reversal drug naloxone, which has saved thousands of lives.</p>

          <p>Savor, a food technology startup, has raised $33 million from investors including Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures to produce cooking fats like butter from carbon, without using animals or plants. The company aims to create sustainable alternatives to traditional agricultural products to reduce the environmental strain of farming, such as greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation. While the company has successfully created a product chemically similar to cow butter, it is currently focused on partnerships with food brands and does not expect to be on grocery shelves until at least 2029.</p>
