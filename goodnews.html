          <p>President Trump announced that India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire after mediation talks led by the United States, though officials from both countries contradicted Trump's claims of US involvement, stating the deal was worked out directly between them. The ceasefire follows days of escalating tensions and military operations between the two nuclear-armed nations, prompting global leaders to urge dialogue for de-escalation. The agreement aims to halt the conflict stemming from a deadly shooting of tourists in the disputed Kashmir territory. The situation remains sensitive, but the ceasefire offers a potential path toward stability.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted President Trump's sweeping government overhaul, ruling that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. The judge sided with a coalition of unions, non-profits, and local governments, blocking mass layoffs for 14 days. The ruling challenges the administration's efforts, led by Elon Musk's 'department of government efficiency' (Doge), to eliminate duplicative roles, automate tasks, and close regional offices. The judge highlighted the potential harm to individuals, families, and communities due to the widespread termination of salaries and benefits.</p>

          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and family formation are becoming increasingly partisan issues, which could hinder efforts to address the looming demographic crisis. The author emphasizes that ensuring economic and societal support for those who choose to have children is crucial and should not be surrendered to culture wars. Policies such as less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare could help close the gap between desired and actual family size. The author urges progressives to proactively engage with the issue of declining population, rather than ceding it to right-wing ideologies.</p>
