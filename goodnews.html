          <p>Apple's annual developer conference (WWDC) featured a significant software update, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass that will change the look of Apple's major devices. This redesign marks the first significant update to the iPhone operating system since 2013, featuring a glass-like lock screen, pill-shaped buttons, and new animations.
