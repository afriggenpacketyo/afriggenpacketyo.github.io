          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey indicated that consumers may start seeing higher prices due to tariffs, potentially towards the end of the month and more significantly in June. Despite Walmart beating quarterly earnings expectations, Rainey expressed concern that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than retailers can absorb. Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. Walmart also posted its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business both in the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>A military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade is expected to include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters, requiring extensive coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration. While Trump confirmed the plans, stating it wasn't tied to his birthday and the cost would be "peanuts," some Democrats have criticized the event as wasteful and self-aggrandizing, especially given the prior postponement of a similar parade due to high costs.</p>

The article asserts that this event marks a milestone for China's defense industry, demonstrating the reliability and lethal power of its state-of-the-art weapons. It also emphasizes that the aerial fight, while between Pakistan and India, represents a duel between Chinese and Western weapon systems, and that China has made significant strides in modernizing its military since the 1991 Gulf War.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the impact of President Trump's tariff easing on small businesses. While the reduction from 145% to 30% on Chinese goods provides some breathing room, the uncertainty of a 90-day pause leaves many businesses hesitant to make long-term plans. Several business owners express concerns about rising costs, potential layoffs, and pausing new product development. They emphasize the need for a long-term trade deal to make predictable decisions, as even the reduced tariff rate still poses challenges, particularly for those with tight margins.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods plans to acquire Foot Locker for approximately $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and diversify its customer base. Dick's, the largest sports retail chain in the U.S., seeks to gain Foot Locker's extensive store footprint and urban consumer base. While Dick's investors showed initial concern due to Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures, the acquisition is expected to enhance the omnichannel experience and strengthen the combined entity's position in the industry. Foot Locker will continue to operate as its own chain under its own name after the deal's completion.</p>

The US solicitor general argued against lower courts' power, while opponents warned of creating a chaotic patchwork citizenship system.

          <p>Canada has emerged as a global leader in digital assets due to its early and evolving regulatory framework for crypto, while the U.S. faces regulatory gridlock. This clarity has turned Toronto into a hub for blockchain growth, attracting Wall Street firms. Robinhood's acquisition of Canadian crypto firm WonderFi is a bet on Canada's established user base and projected crypto revenue.

The visit was part of a larger diplomatic tour through the Middle East, including stops in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Trump praised the mosque's beauty and the incredible culture it represents.
