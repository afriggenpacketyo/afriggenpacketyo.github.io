        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources indicate that most bidders seeking a stake in Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at as much as $5 billion. This potential deal would mark one of the most significant China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years, allowing Starbucks to navigate a market characterized by sluggish growth and fierce local competition. The offers, valuing the unit at approximately 10 times its expected 2025 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, signal a strategic re-evaluation of its presence. This move could help Starbucks streamline its focus and resources in other key markets while potentially benefiting from a substantial cash injection and adapting to evolving consumer preferences.</p>

Trump praised the attendees as a "high-IQ group" leading a "revolution in business and in genius," seeking to cultivate close ties and secure investment pledges for U.S. projects. Discussions during the event included advancements in vaccine technology, with Bill Gates highlighting the need for new research. This gathering underscores Trump's ongoing efforts to engage with influential tech titans and encourage domestic investment, despite past public disagreements with some figures like Musk and his administration's stance on vaccine skepticism.</p>

          <p>Wang Xiongfei, a leading European power systems expert, has returned to China to assume a prominent academic position at Tsinghua University, bringing significant expertise in grid stability. Wang previously led over 40 research projects funded by the EU, Denmark, Sweden, and various corporations, collaborating with major grid and energy companies across Europe. His notable contributions include developing and commercializing software for automatically measuring impedance profiles of power electronic systems, a tool widely adopted for analyzing energy grid stability. Furthermore, Wang is involved in the design and construction of one of the world's first offshore energy hub islands in Denmark, providing critical grid protection for European offshore wind farms connected to direct current transmission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is equipping soldiers with artificial intelligence tools on their phones, drones, and laptops to enhance rapid threat identification, following a $98.9 million contract with TurbineOne. This technology helps troops quickly detect threats like drone launch sites or concealed enemy positions, offering insights typically provided by analysts. The initiative aligns with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's directive for the military to adopt more commercial software and AI, moving away from older systems. The ultimate goal is to process battlefield data 10 to 25 times faster than adversaries, a capability deemed crucial for maintaining battlefield superiority in increasingly volatile and complex environments where traditional communication can be easily compromised or jammed.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have formally committed to providing postwar security guarantees to Ukraine, including the deployment of an international "reassurance force" on land, sea, and in the air. These troops would be positioned outside the frontline, aiming to prevent any new major aggression against Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lauded this as a crucial and concrete step, with U.S. contributions expected to be finalized in the coming days. The announcement followed a summit where European leaders pressed U.S. President Donald Trump for vital backing, amidst continued Russian rejection of any such security commitments and ongoing military actions in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a Democrat, challenged President Trump to a debate, suggesting they "cut out the middle man" after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for a series of debates with Mamdani. Trump had previously expressed concern about a "communist" becoming mayor and reportedly explored job offers to persuade incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out. Mamdani, currently leading in the polls, used the challenge to criticize Trump's policies on SNAP benefits and tax cuts. Meanwhile, Cuomo believes he is the strongest candidate to defeat Mamdani in a head-to-head race, despite his own primary loss, highlighting the complex and politically charged nature of the mayoral contest.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order formalizing a trade deal with Japan, setting a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese imports, including autos, with specific sector-based levies. As part of the agreement, Tokyo committed to investing $550 billion in U.S. projects and increasing purchases of American agricultural and defense products, alongside offering market access in various sectors. This deal, finalized after months of negotiations, comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces significant internal discontent within his ruling Liberal Democratic Party, following recent election losses and growing calls for a leadership change. The political instability in Japan adds a complex layer to the implementation and long-term implications of this substantial trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump reiterated his warning about imposing "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not shift production to the U.S. However, he explicitly signaled that firms like Apple, which have pledged significant domestic manufacturing investments, would likely be exempt from these levies. Trump made these comments during a White House dinner with tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, who had previously committed $100 billion to U.S. manufacturing. This policy aims to accelerate the reshoring of the semiconductor supply chain, building on existing commitments from major global chip companies. The administration's push underscores a broader strategy for economic nationalism and strengthening domestic industrial capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with a cash value of $770.3 million. An analysis of Powerball data reveals significant disparities in after-tax payouts across states, due to varying state income taxes on winnings. While federal law mandates a 24% withholding and an additional 14.6% due at tax time, states like California, Florida, and Texas impose no state tax, allowing winners to take home more. Conversely, states like New York have the lowest after-tax annuitized payout, highlighting the impact of local tax policies on lottery fortunes.</p>

The court affirmed a lower judge's ruling that Trump's policy was arbitrary and rooted in "unconstitutional animus" toward transgender Americans, finding that it caused immediate and irreparable harm to affected individuals.

          <p>China's Hunan province is exploring a novel application for its central bank-backed digital yuan, or e-CNY: clearing persistent payment defaults. This initiative aims to broaden the digital currency's utility beyond its current use cases since its 2019 launch. The proposed model involves using the digital yuan to ensure funds directly reach the end of complex payment chains, enhancing traceability and transparency in often opaque financial relationships. Analysts suggest this move could significantly improve real-time visibility and control over economic transactions, potentially addressing a long-standing issue of chain debts and payment delays within the Chinese economy.
