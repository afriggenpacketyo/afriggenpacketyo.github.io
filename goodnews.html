          <p>Across the U.S., communities commemorated Juneteenth, the federal holiday marking the end of slavery following the Civil War, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day. Celebrations included parades, art shows, and educational workshops, paying homage to June 19, 1865, when the last enslaved people in Texas were freed. Juneteenth became a U.S. holiday in 2021 under the Biden administration, with festivities growing since its national recognition. Events ranged from small gatherings to large parades, reflecting the holiday's increasing significance and widespread observance across the nation. The holiday is a moment of reflection on the history of slavery and the ongoing pursuit of equality.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Yeztugo, a twice-yearly injectable medication developed by Gilead Sciences, for the prevention of HIV. This is the first and only drug of its kind, offering a potentially transformative approach to HIV prevention. Clinical trials have demonstrated the drug's high effectiveness, even surpassing daily oral medications like Truvada. Yeztugo's unique multi-stage approach distinguishes it from other antiviral medications, and it is considered a major scientific breakthrough in the fight against HIV. The most common side effects reported during clinical trials included injection site reactions, headaches, and nausea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive a ¬£150 discount on their energy bills this winter due to changes in the Warm Home Discount scheme. The government is scrapping the property size and energy score qualifications, extending the benefit to 2.7 million additional homes, including nearly a million with children. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some argue that the scheme still excludes those most at risk. The expansion will be funded by energy companies, potentially leading to a slight increase in customer bills, though the government says savings from cutting company expenditure will offset this rise.

          <p>The United States saw a significant increase in its millionaire population in 2024, adding approximately a thousand new millionaires each day, according to a UBS report. With 23.8 million millionaires, the U.S. leads globally, followed by mainland China. However, the first half of 2025 has been more challenging due to trade war concerns and recession fears impacting markets and the dollar. While a weaker dollar typically boosts wealth growth in countries with non-dollar currencies, it remains uncertain whether U.S. household wealth will continue to grow at the same rate.

          <p>Students should be prepared to encounter shocking and offensive views at university, according to Arif Ahmed of the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS has published guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech under a new law set to take effect in August. The guidance covers various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, emphasizing the freedom to discuss any topic within legal boundaries. The Union of Jewish Students welcomed the clarification that Holocaust denial is not protected speech, while also ensuring protection against antisemitic harassment.</p>

          <p>Samsung is planning to release a thinner version of its flagship foldable smartphone to compete with Chinese rivals like Honor and Oppo. These companies have released foldables that are lighter and thinner than Samsung's offerings. With foldables, thinness has become more critical than ever because people aren't prepared to accept the compromise for a thicker and heavier phone to get the real estate that a folding phone can deliver. Samsung's newest Galaxy Z series is the thinnest, lightest and most advanced foldable yet ‚Äì meticulously crafted and built to last.</p>

          <p>A Japanese district court has ordered the state to pay a total of 1.2 million yen in compensation to two asylum seekers. The court ruled that their repeated detentions by the country's immigration agency did not adequately consider their physical and mental conditions. The plaintiffs, a Kurdish man and an Iranian national, had been detained and released several times over more than a decade. The court found that some detentions violated international human rights covenants, but dismissed claims that the immigration law itself infringes human rights.</p>
