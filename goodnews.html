          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng announced its eighth consecutive month of delivering over 30,000 cars, with 34,611 vehicles delivered in June. This performance stands out amid a fierce price war in China's EV market that has challenged competitors like Nio, Li Auto, and Zeekr. While industry giant BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's steady sales momentum has been a positive signal. The intense competition has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, even as rivals like Xiaomi enter the market with aggressively priced models.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The decision by U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan prevents the Department of Homeland Security from revoking the status in September, as had been planned. The judge determined that the DHS Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration date in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential shift would involve de-emphasizing the marketing of its 18A process technology to external clients and focusing resources on the next-generation 14A process. This move aims to better compete with rival TSMC and win major customers like Apple and Nvidia. Such a change could result in a substantial financial write-off but is being considered as part of a broader effort to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker.</p>

For the second consecutive month, Border Patrol reportedly did not release any migrants into the U.S. These figures stand in sharp contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, which often exceeded 6,000 per day.</p>

The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's powerful testimony before lawmakers was a key catalyst for the bill's passage, creating a lasting legacy of environmental protection in her name.</p>
