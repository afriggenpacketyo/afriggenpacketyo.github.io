          <p>Energy drink conglomerate Red Bull has completed a takeover of the Newcastle Falcons, a prominent English rugby union club. This marks Red Bull's first venture into the sport, adding to its extensive portfolio in football, motor racing, and winter sports. The club, which will be renamed the Newcastle Red Bulls, has struggled in recent seasons, finishing last in the Premiership for three consecutive years. The acquisition secures the team's long-term financial future and aims to enhance its competitive potential under the continued leadership of director of rugby Steve Diamond.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has indicated he may allow Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its most advanced AI chip, the Blackwell system, to China. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested a deal could be possible if the chip's performance was reduced by 30% to 50%, and mentioned a planned meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This potential policy shift follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of China sales revenue for export licenses. The move is seen by some analysts as a strategy to make China dependent on substandard American technology.</p>

          <p>The UFC has secured a seven-year, $7.7 billion media deal with Paramount, shifting away from its traditional pay-per-view model to broaden its audience. This strategic move comes amid questions about whether UFC President Dana White's close ties to Donald Trump could be a liability for the globally diverse sport. The article explores the complex political identity of the UFC's fanbase, which is not monolithically conservative, and notes that recent data shows declining pay-per-view buys. The new deal with Paramount, a company also facing political scrutiny, suggests the UFC is aiming to expand its reach as it navigates a shifting cultural and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Swiss sneaker company On Holding reported a 32% sales increase in its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue forecast to 2.91 billion Swiss francs. This positive outlook comes despite the company facing new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources about 90% of its products. On offset the increased costs by raising prices, particularly on its lifestyle products, without seeing a slowdown in consumer demand. The brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors like Nike, saw strong growth across all regions, especially in China where sales grew by 50%.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will shut down its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with the 1990s, effective September 30. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, was a pivotal gateway to the internet for millions of Americans. It played a significant role in bridging the "digital divide" by using existing telephone lines, making it widely accessible. While largely replaced by broadband, a small percentage of households, particularly in rural areas, still relied on dial-up, and they will now need to find alternative ways to connect to the internet.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian international defender Illia Zabarnyi has been transferred from English Premier League club Bournemouth to Paris St-Germain in a deal valued at €66 million (£57m). The 22-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the reigning European champions. This move marks the third significant sale of a defender by Bournemouth during the current transfer window, following high-value deals for Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez. While the sales require a defensive rebuild for the Cherries, they represent a substantial financial profit for the club on the three players.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly considering a deal for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze to strengthen their attacking options. The interest comes as Spurs look for reinforcements following a long-term knee injury to key midfielder James Maddison. Eze, 27, had a strong season with Palace, scoring 14 goals, and was part of England's squad for Euro 2024. Tottenham is also in discussions with Manchester City for winger Savinho, but sources indicate that Eze has emerged as a serious target, though it is unclear if the club will pursue both players.</p>

          <p>Chilean authorities have dropped all charges against Ethan Guo, a 19-year-old American pilot who was detained on King George Island in Antarctica since June. Guo was accused of illegally landing his plane in Chilean territory and providing false flight plan information. As part of the resolution, a judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chile for three years. Guo had embarked on a solo flight across all seven continents to raise money for cancer research and is now awaiting approval to continue his mission.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has affirmed the company's commitment to its S$6.8 billion expansion, despite a shortened casino license renewal from regulators. Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance when it renewed the license for two years instead of the usual three. In response, RWS is shifting its focus from shopping to experiences, launching new attractions like Minion Land and the Singapore Oceanarium. The integrated resort aims to transform into a premium lifestyle destination, with plans for new luxury hotels and a waterfront complex to enhance its appeal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their current trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing the imposition of higher tariffs that were set to take effect. The pause keeps the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extension will provide more time for negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and addressing other economic and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year, with U.S. imports from China down 15% in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mystery surrounding a missing cyclist in Scotland was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman who secretly marked a gravesite with a Red Bull can. The woman, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, was told by her then-boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, that he had killed a man in a hit-and-run and buried the body. After he showed her the remote location, she dropped the can as a marker and alerted police. The body was identified as Tony Parsons, who vanished during a charity bike ride in 2017, finally bringing a long-awaited resolution to his family.</p>
