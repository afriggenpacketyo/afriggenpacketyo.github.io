          <p>Chinese state broadcaster CCTV aired a documentary detailing the development of the J-10 fighter jet, shortly after reports surfaced that Pakistan's air force used the J-10C variant to shoot down Indian planes during the Kashmir conflict. Pakistan's foreign minister claimed J-10C jets downed Indian warplanes, including French Rafale fighter jets, which Delhi did not confirm, though a French official acknowledged losing a Rafale. CCTV later referenced the Kashmir conflict, stating the J-10CE had achieved its first combat success by shooting down foreign jets without any losses, emphasizing the aircraft's advanced features and radar cross-section reduction measures.</p>

          <p>The tradition of Indianapolis 500 winners drinking milk started in 1936 when Louis Meyer, after winning his third Indy 500, drank buttermilk, a drink his mother told him would refresh him on a warm day. A cameraman captured the moment, and a dairy industry executive requested that milk be given to every winner. From 1947 to 1954, winners were handed cold water in a silver chalice, but the milk tradition returned in 1956. Since then, 69 consecutive winners have enjoyed milk in the victory circle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to conclude talks on the Chagos Islands deal has been temporarily suspended by a High Court injunction. Two Chagossian women, Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrie Pompe, filed a case against the Foreign Office, resulting in an "interim relief" order. The agreement would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The court will reconvene to hear the case again, as the legal action claims the government failed to consult the Chagossian people adequately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating investors seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act and a pro-crypto agenda from U.S. President Donald Trump, have also supported the market.</p>

Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung cited Lim's human rights work and international exchange experience as reasons for the appointment, noting his service as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Lim, who founded Chthonic in 1995, used his music to call attention to Taiwan's struggles and exclusion from international bodies.

          <p>China has called on the European Union to ensure a "fair" playing field for businesses following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission is suggesting a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, while parcels sent to European warehouses would incur a 50-cent fee. The proposed fee is expected to generate around 3 billion euros in income for Brussels, intended to cover the costs of customs and safety checks.</p>

          <p>Shares in Xpeng are set to extend their rally of nearly 80% this year, with analysts citing the Chinese electric-vehicle maker's introduction of newer models and progress toward profitability. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales, with 94,008 vehicles delivered in the first three months. This improved top line helped narrow its net loss and lifted its gross margin. Analysts expect Xpeng to turn profitable in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. (not investment advice)</p>
