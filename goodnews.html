          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, continuing its strategy of observing the effects of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the relative strength of the economy, noting solid labor market conditions, but also cautioned that new tariffs could increase inflation and slow economic growth. The central bank will continue to monitor tariff developments to inform future rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Border wall construction is increasing in Arizona and Texas following actions from the federal government, with illegal crossings plummeting to historic lows. U.S. Customs and Border Protection allocated over $300 million to build 27 miles of the wall in Arizona's Tucson Sector. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has expedited wall construction through environmental waivers. According to CBP, zero individuals who crossed illegally were released into the U.S. interior in May, compared to 62,000 last year, and migrant encounters have significantly decreased, marking a 93% decrease in illegal crossings compared to the previous year.</p>

Classic navy walls are most desired in bedrooms, potentially adding an estimated $1,815 to the home's value. Zillow also found that buyers prefer dark gray living rooms, which can boost an offer by about $2,600. (not investment advice)</p>
