        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby stated that the company's significant expansion, which outpaces rivals, is proving successful due to customer preference for its superior products and technology. Kirby believes United's brand loyalty makes it resilient even during economic downturns and anticipates strong fourth-quarter results as the economy recovers. He contrasted this growth with the struggles of ultra-discount carriers like Spirit Airlines, reinforcing his view that their business model is failing in the current market. The airline is also two-thirds complete with a fleet-wide cabin modernization project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights three subtle yet costly habits that can exacerbate personal debt despite regular payments. These include falling into the "minimum payment trap," where most of the payment covers interest rather than principal, and overusing "buy now, pay later" services, which can lead to an accumulation of hidden debt. Another pitfall is relying too heavily on balance transfers without addressing underlying spending habits, often resulting in high interest rates once promotional periods end. The article advises borrowers to be more strategic by paying more than the minimum and using credit tools as part of a structured debt-reduction plan.</p>

          <p>Cloud security provider Netskope has raised its expected valuation to $7.3 billion for its initial public offering, increasing its share price range from $15-$17 to $17-$19. This move signals strong investor confidence and tests the current hot streak for tech IPOs, potentially raising over $900 million. The company's public debut comes amid a surge in major cybersecurity acquisitions, such as Google's purchase of Wiz and Palo Alto's acquisition of CyberArk. Netskope's decision reflects a renewed appetite in the public markets for tech companies after a period of economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Cardi B spoke with Gayle King about her reputation for being outspoken ahead of the release of her new album, titled "Am I the Drama?" The rapper acknowledged that her big personality often makes her a target for controversy and headlines, but she insisted that she does not enjoy the conflict. She reflected on how this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." The new album's title directly engages with this long-running public image, while she states that much of the drama causes her significant stress.</p>

          <h2>Analyzing Potential Earnings from a 2-Year Certificate of Deposit</h2>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high but potentially poised to fall, long-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to lock in current returns. This article calculates the potential interest earned on a 2-year CD opened in September with a competitive 4.06% APY, showing returns from approximately $83 on a $1,000 deposit to over $4,100 on a $50,000 deposit. While variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings offer more flexibility, their rates will likely decrease if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cut campaign. The article suggests that the guaranteed return of a CD may be a worthwhile trade-off for sacrificing liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Rise of Whole-Body Deodorants Reflects Growing Anxiety Over Personal Scent</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for whole-body deodorants is expanding rapidly, driven by a pervasive cultural anxiety about body odor that may have been heightened post-pandemic. This article explores the history of deodorant marketing, which has long capitalized on fear, and how modern consumers are internalizing these messages to an extreme degree. While these products offer a sense of control in anxious times, olfactory scientists caution that altering our natural scent may interfere with primal forms of communication related to health and compatibility. Eliminating our unique body odor could have unknown social and biological consequences.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Is the Most Cost-Effective Power Source</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 13:28:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. Using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, investment bank Lazard found onshore wind to be the most affordable, followed by solar, while coal and nuclear power are significantly more expensive to generate. While the Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits further lower renewable costs, President Trump's policies aim to phase out these incentives while expanding breaks for fossil fuels. Experts note that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary to ensure grid stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A framework deal for TikTok's U.S. operations has been reached, which will involve both new and existing investors from its parent company, ByteDance. According to sources, the deal is expected to close within 30 to 45 days and will allow Oracle to maintain its cloud and data security agreement with the social media platform. This development follows years of uncertainty after Congress passed a bill requiring ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations over national security concerns. The final structure and capitalization of the new entity are still being determined, but it is not expected to go public.</p>

          <p>In an advice column, a military veteran and retired federal employee expresses feelings of being "lost and pointless" despite achieving an ideal early retirement. The letter writer struggles with ennui while witnessing global and national turmoil. The columnist, James Parker, suggests this may be a form of survivor's guilt and advises the reader to embrace idleness and gentleness with themselves. He reframes this state not as self-care but as a form of revolution in a chaotic world, arguing that people who can savor existence will be needed in the difficult times ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The reverse mortgage 6-month rule dictates the timeline for heirs to address the loan after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Lenders must issue a "Due and Payable" letter, giving the estate six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to cover the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While extensions are possible with HUD approval, the deadline underscores the importance of advance estate planning for borrowers who wish for their heirs to keep the family home.

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The move reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that had limited the validity of travel authorizations for some Hungarians due to security concerns over the country's simplified naturalization process. Officials stated that Hungary has now taken sufficient steps to address these security vulnerabilities. This decision is another sign of the warming relationship between the Trump administration and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whom Trump has praised as a "fantastic leader."</p>
