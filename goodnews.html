          <p>Karoline Leavitt, the youngest person to serve as White House press secretary, has moved into the traditional, spacious press secretary's office in the West Wing. This office, previously occupied by Taylor Budowich, signifies influence due to its proximity to the Oval Office. Leavitt, 28, is taking on some of Budowich's former duties following his departure. This move reestablishes the long-standing tradition of the press secretary occupying this prominent space.</p>

          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, with overall increases of around 8% year-over-year, largely propelled by record electric vehicle (EV) sales. Consumers accelerated EV purchases to take advantage of expiring $7,500 federal incentives, leading to EV sales more than doubling for GM and increasing 30% for Ford. Industry experts predict a temporary dip in EV sales post-incentive, but automakers are already adjusting pricing and financing to maintain momentum in the evolving market.

          <p>A 20-point peace plan proposed by President Donald Trump seeks to conclude the nearly two-year war in the Gaza Strip and facilitate the return of 46 hostages held by Hamas. The initiative, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly accepted, aims to disarm Hamas and rebuild Gaza under a Palestinian governing body with international oversight. While the plan offers a potential pathway to peace, its implementation could also threaten Netanyahu's political standing. Hamas's agreement is still pending for the plan to move forward.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, indicating investors are largely unfazed. Historical data suggests that shutdowns typically have a modest, temporary impact on financial markets and the broader economy, with economic activity often recovering quickly afterward. The S&P 500 has, on average, gained 0.3% during past shutdowns and 13% in the subsequent 12 months. However, concerns remain that a prolonged shutdown could increase market uncertainty and halt the release of critical economic data, making it harder for investors to assess the economic landscape.

          <p>FIFA is expected to schedule 2026 World Cup matches involving major European teams after midnight UK time to mitigate heat issues experienced during the recent Club World Cup. The tournament, hosted in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will have 48 teams and 11 consecutive days of four group-stage games. This decision prioritizes player welfare over European broadcast convenience, as midday kick-offs in host cities led to complaints about extreme heat and humidity. Organizers are working to balance global viewing audiences with challenging summer conditions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 16:06:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to stabilize its currency and support President Javier Milei's free-market reforms. This controversial bailout, despite contradicting "America First" rhetoric, aims to prevent Milei's economic agenda from failing, which could discredit market-oriented policies across Latin America. Milei has significantly reduced inflation and revived the housing market, but his managed peso devaluation created a currency crisis. The loan, from an existing Federal Reserve credit line, is contingent on Argentina eliminating capital controls and the U.S. dropping export tax demands. (not investment advice)</p>

The article highlights the roles of Black and Afro-descendant women in preserving these sung dances and features San Jacinto as an epicenter for gaita music. It also touches on the complex history of cumbia's acceptance, from being initially rejected by higher classes to becoming a national symbol.</p>
