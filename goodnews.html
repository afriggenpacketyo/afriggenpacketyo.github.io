        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has taken an unconventional 10% ownership stake in Intel, making it the chipmaker's largest single shareholder. This strategic move, converting grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into equity, is aimed at boosting domestic semiconductor manufacturing to compete with China and secure the nation's supply chain for critical technologies like artificial intelligence. The decision reflects growing concerns about reliance on foreign producers, particularly Taiwan's TSMC, amid geopolitical tensions. While experts see the necessity in supporting the domestic industry, the government's direct involvement raises questions about potential political influence on Intel's business decisions.

          <p>A recent gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes major Asian powers like China, Russia, and India, has underscored the need for a new global economic architecture. The article argues that while the SCO issues declarations of political cooperation, a more substantial, Bretton Woods-style agreement is necessary to prevent further fragmentation of the world into competing economic blocs. The author suggests that the expanding influence of the SCO, now comprising 27 members and partners, gives it the potential to lead such an initiative. This would involve creating new monetary institutions and trade regimes to foster a more integrated and stable international order.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status highlights Japan's pressing succession crisis, as there are no other young male heirs. The country's law currently prohibits women, such as Emperor Naruhito's daughter Princess Aiko, from ascending the throne. This event has renewed public and political debate over whether to amend the male-only succession rule, a tradition that conservatives are keen to preserve by potentially reintroducing distant male relatives into the imperial line.</p>

The article explores how the team's identity is deeply intertwined with the city of Buffalo, reflecting its history of resilience and its underdog spirit. The author describes the communal bonding that comes from supporting a team known for its near-misses, such as four consecutive Super Bowl losses in the 1990s. This shared experience of hope and heartbreak fosters a powerful sense of belonging and community, transforming sports fandom from a casual interest into a meaningful connection to a place and its people.</p>

The performance was praised for its grit and work rate against a higher-ranked opponent, putting early pressure on Denmark in the competitive group. Historically, Scotland has struggled in the early stages of qualification campaigns, but this solid start provides a foundation for optimism. Key players, including some returning from injury or with limited club game time, delivered strong performances, suggesting the team under manager Steve Clarke is resilient and capable of competing.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed the legendary 'scorpion kick' during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, creating one of football's most iconic moments.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the protections was 'arbitrary and capricious,' noting that it would force people to return to dangerously unstable home countries. The ruling provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands who faced the imminent loss of their legal right to live and work in the U.S. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision, vowing to use every legal option to end the program.</p>

          <p>An intense 'talent war' has erupted in the tech industry, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google offering multi-million dollar compensation packages to attract a small pool of elite artificial intelligence researchers and engineers. The high demand is driven by the race to build and dominate the market for large language models, which costs billions of dollars to develop, making high salaries a relatively small part of the overall investment. This fierce competition for talent is inflating wages to unprecedented levels, creating challenges for startups and traditional industries that cannot compete with the salaries offered by Big Tech, potentially widening an innovation gap.
