          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief dubbed the "Devil in the Ozarks," was apprehended near the Calico Rock prison in Arkansas, almost two weeks after his escape. Hardin, who was serving time for murder and sexual assault, had donned a law enforcement-like uniform to facilitate his escape. Law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Border Patrol and tracking dogs, located Hardin a short distance from the prison, confirming his identity through fingerprint analysis. Hardin was initially imprisoned in 2017 for fatally shooting James Appleton and was later sentenced for the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher. The authorities have confirmed that there is no longer an active threat to public safety.</p>

These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing that learning and empowerment can occur anywhere, nurturing a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating children with love rather than being overly critical. The research emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel encouraged to explore their interests and develop a positive outlook. The study also notes that parents often underestimate their children's capabilities and the value of everyday learning experiences.</p>

          <p>Merryl Hoffman, an attorney, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest in Manhattan, but was saved by two passing nurses, Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, who performed CPR. Hoffman collapsed outside Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where the nurses were walking to work. Their quick actions kept Hoffman alive until the ambulance arrived, and she was later treated and recovered. Hoffman had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest and reconnected with the nurses, expressing her gratitude for their life-saving intervention.</p>

          <p>Japan and the European Union are planning to establish a "Japan-EU Competitiveness Alliance" to strengthen their companies' competitiveness and promote trade and economic security cooperation. This alliance is aimed at addressing concerns over U.S. tariffs and Chinese trade practices. The initiative, expected to be announced at a summit meeting in July, builds upon the existing free trade agreement between Japan and the EU. It will focus on diversifying supply chains for rare earth minerals, aligning subsidy conditions for environmental technology, and reforming the World Trade Organization.</p>
