          <p>President Donald Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples. Hoover, 74, was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, drug, and other criminal charges. Hoover's lawyer Justin Moore posted online that Hoover was released from federal prison, and that Illinois must send him home for good. While in prison, Hoover has publicly disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, though authorities have alleged that he continued to promote Gangster Disciples members while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, known for "Chrisley Knows Best," were pardoned by President Donald Trump after serving two and a half years in prison for bank fraud and tax evasion.

Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, claimed that prosecutors had her father's head "on a dart board" before his prison sentence.

Parker emphasizes the importance of asking questions that everyone can answer and that relate to the group's context. She provides examples such as, "What was the first concert you went to, and who took you?" and advises to "read the room" before introducing such questions.</p>

          <p>Financial markets welcomed a U.S. court ruling that blocks President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law. The court found the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the use of tariffs. The White House immediately appealed and it was unclear if Trump would abide by the ruling in the interim. The future for the S&P 500 was up 1.5% while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen.

          <p>The Women's US Open is coming at a crucial moment for the game, and the ebullient Whan, better than most golf executives, understands such dynamics. There was an early setback when players failed to turn up for an important sponsor dinner they were expected to attend. A proposed merger with the Ladies European Tour looked certain to be completed but came to nothing. The new commissioner has to reconnect with players and sponsors and "get the tour back to where it was when Mike Whan left it".</p>
