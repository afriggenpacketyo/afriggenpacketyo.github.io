          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, on bail after he was detained by ICE. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat, despite the government's arguments. Khalil's arrest had sparked protests, with his attorneys arguing that his free speech rights were being violated, and the judge expressed skepticism about the government's reasons for keeping him detained. The government accused Khalil of failing to disclose information when applying for permanent residency, but the judge found this reason "highly unusual" and suggested it was a pretext to punish him for his protests. Under the conditions of his release, Khalil is permitted to travel domestically for court appearances, attorney visits, and lobbying purposes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This satirical article humorously critiques the lack of a clear uniform for ICE agents, questioning how individuals are supposed to recognize them as law enforcement officials. The piece suggests that without a uniform, agents might be mistaken for rogue criminals rather than officers of the law. It mocks the idea that agents should prioritize self-expression over accountability and official representation. The article sarcastically advises agents to avoid anything that might identify them as acting in an official capacity, recommending outfits that would make people question their authority.</p>

The film is a remix of his preoccupations and highlights the weight of time, where the actors age before the viewer's eyes.
