        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have increased for the third consecutive week, reaching their highest point since January, yet demand from homebuyers continues to grow. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, purchase applications rose by 2% compared to the previous week and are 18% higher than the same week last year, driven by increased housing inventory. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 6.98%, while refinance applications fell by 7%, though still 37% higher than a year ago. Despite a stronger than expected Consumer Confidence Index, concerns over the labor market may push rates slightly lower in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Macy's has lowered its full-year profit forecast due to the impact of higher tariffs, increased promotional activities, and a moderation in discretionary spending, even as it surpassed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations.

The company's net income for the quarter was $38 million, down from $62 million in the same period last year, with comparable sales declining at Macy's namesake brand but increasing at Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. Macy's is continuing its turnaround efforts by closing underperforming stores and investing in its luxury and beauty segments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Airline passengers in Turkey who unbuckle their seat belts or access overhead compartments before the plane has completely stopped will now face fines, according to new regulations from the Turkish civil aviation authority. The rules, effective earlier this month, aim to enhance safety and ensure orderly disembarkation following complaints and flight inspections revealing safety violations during taxiing after landing. Commercial airlines are required to issue revised in-flight announcements warning passengers of the fines, which could be up to $70. The aviation authority noted that many passengers stand up before the aircraft reaches its parking position, compromising safety and disregarding the satisfaction of other travelers.</p>

The company expects revenue to range from $13.6 billion to $13.9 billion, aligning with analysts' expectations, as the company's CEO Lauren Hobart stated that the reaffirmation reflects a strong start to the year and confidence in the company's strategies. The company's net income for the quarter was $264 million, with sales rising to $3.17 billion, up about 5% from the previous year, and the outlook doesn't include costs or results from the acquisition of Foot Locker. Despite initial reactions to the Foot Locker acquisition, Dick's anticipates the transaction to be accretive to earnings and deliver cost synergies in the first full fiscal year post-close.

          <p>Following the expensive 'Maycember' period, characterized by a convergence of graduations, school events, and summer plans, financial experts recommend returning to a basic budget. Reviewing spending and reassessing financial plans are key steps, particularly addressing any accumulated credit card debt through strategies like the avalanche or snowball method. Automating savings, such as setting up recurring transfers to an emergency fund, is also advised to rebuild after heavy spending. Scaling back on discretionary expenses and seeking side gigs can further accelerate debt repayment and financial recovery, and it is important to plan ahead for next year's expenses.</p>

He expressed his disappointment in an interview with CBS News, arguing that the legislation could increase the deficit by approximately $600 billion in the next fiscal year.

Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion gas turbines and energy solutions deal with Saudi Arabia and an executive order supporting the U.S. nuclear power industry, have further boosted GE Vernova's stock, leading the Club to downgrade it to a hold-equivalent 2 rating due to the rapid increase.

          <p>Vanguard's research suggests that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is a top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing the impact of high income or significant assets. The survey of over 12,000 investors found that individuals with emergency savings reported greater improvement in financial well-being, providing confidence to handle unexpected expenses. Financial anxiety can be reduced by being prepared for unplanned expenses, and having savings readily available in a bank account means that people are better equipped to handle car repairs or medical bills.

          <h2>Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Erupts Again, Shooting Lava High into the Air</h2>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted dramatically, shooting lava fountains over 1,000 feet into the air during a six-hour event. The eruption, the 23rd in a series that began last December, produced large lava flows covering half of the Halema'uma'u crater floor. The U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory reports no immediate danger to nearby communities, as all activity remains within a closed area of Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park. However, residents are warned of potential hazards, including sulfur dioxide emissions, volcanic smog, and dangerous strands of volcanic glass.</p>

          <h2>Protein Myths Debunked: How Much Do You Really Need?</h2>

          <p>A deep dive into the world of protein reveals that many commonly held beliefs about protein intake are myths. The recommendation of one gram of protein per pound of body weight is excessive, and there's no need to obsess over protein intake to gain muscle, as studies show that the benefits of eating more protein top out at around 0.73 grams per pound of body weight per day. The article encourages readers to be cautious about both extremely low and extremely high protein recommendations, and it advocates for plant-based protein sources as a healthy and ethical alternative to animal products.</p>
