          <p>Actor and director Ben Stiller's new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," delves into the complex personal and professional relationship of his parents, the legendary comedy duo Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film uses extensive archival footage and newly discovered audio recordings made by his father to explore the tensions and love that defined their 62-year marriage. Stiller also turns the lens on himself, examining how his parents' fame and relationship dynamics shaped his own life and struggles. The project became a deeply personal journey of reconnecting with his late parents and understanding his own family patterns.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, the Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to play internationally again in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. The team, composed of players now living in Australia, the UK, Portugal, and Italy, sees the tournament as a major platform to represent Afghan women whose rights have been severely curtailed. Defender Najma Arefi stated the team carries the responsibility of being a voice for the silenced and an inspiration for those still in Afghanistan. This event marks a significant step toward the team's potential readmission into the official FIFA community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following over a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement was mediated by Qatar and Turkey, with both sides committing to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability. The conflict, the worst since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, escalated after Pakistan was accused of carrying out attacks in Kabul, leading to cross-border strikes that caused dozens of civilian casualties. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support groups attacking Pakistan, and further talks are scheduled.</p>

          <h2>People's Liberation Army Activity Near Taiwan Remains Subdued Following President Lai's Policy Speech</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent policy speech by Taiwanese President William Lai, whom Beijing has labeled a "troublemaker," there have been no major military activities by China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) near the island. According to Taiwanese defense figures, the number of PLA sorties conducted in the week after the speech was relatively low, ranging from seven to 27 per day. This level of activity is significantly lower than previous large-scale exercises, such as one in April that involved 76 sorties. The current restraint contrasts with Beijing's past actions, where it has used massive drills as a "serious warning" to what it terms "Taiwan independence forces."</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a plan to generate 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy industry over the next five years, aiming to double the sector's workforce. The strategy focuses on training and recruiting workers for 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, for roles in renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy. To support this goal, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match military veterans and others with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills and creating secure industrial jobs.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of The Desert Inn and the family that founded it, particularly Earl Coffman, who helped transform Palm Springs into a premier resort destination. Established in 1909 by his mother Nellie, the hotel became the town's largest employer and a center for civic and social life before the city's incorporation. Earl Coffman, a World War I veteran and skilled horseman, managed the inn with a focus on creating a world-class establishment, while also managing other prestigious hotels in the summers. His visionary zeal and business acumen were instrumental not only in the hotel's success but also in other major local projects.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Praises Federal Judges for Resisting President Trump's Justifications for Troop Deployments</h2>

          <p>An opinion article commends two federal district court judges in Chicago and Portland for blocking President Donald Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. The judges are praised for courageously challenging the president's rationale, with one describing his justification as "untethered to the facts" and not "conceived in good faith." The author contrasts these lower court actions with what is described as the Supreme Court's deference to Trump. The piece argues that these rulings uphold the nation's tradition of resisting military intrusion into civil affairs and are a vital defense of constitutional law over martial law.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is exploring a potential cut to the 5% value-added tax (VAT) on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While not confirming any decision ahead of the November Budget, Miliband acknowledged the affordability challenges facing the country and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The government is under pressure to reduce energy costs, with Labour having previously pledged to lower average bills significantly by 2030. Miliband emphasized that a long-term transition to home-grown clean energy is the ultimate solution for high bills.</p>

          <p>Zhu Guangyao, a former vice-minister of finance for China, expressed confidence that the country's economy will achieve its growth target of around 5% this year. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China could maintain an annual growth rate between 4.5% and 5% for the next five years. This sustained growth, he argued, would establish a solid foundation for the nation to achieve its 2035 goal of "socialist modernization." Zhu's optimistic forecast comes as Chinese leaders prepare for a crucial party plenum to set economic priorities amid ongoing rivalry with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a significant spike in orders from the U.S., which the company attributes to clients stockpiling products ahead of President Trump's threatened 100% tariff on Chinese imports. The company received over 1,000 new orders in a single week, with clients explicitly citing the need to avoid potential price hikes, forcing the firm's factories to work overtime. A company source humorously thanked Trump for acting as a "sales consultant," noting that the current rush of "emergency purchases" is far greater than what was seen during previous tariff threats.

          <p>As the Medicare open enrollment period begins, experts are urging beneficiaries to carefully compare their coverage options for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. The article outlines the key choices available, such as switching between original Medicare and a private Medicare Advantage plan, or changing Part D prescription drug coverage. It highlights the importance of checking for changes in costs, provider networks, and drug formularies, as these can significantly impact out-of-pocket spending. The ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information, leading some experts to advise waiting to finalize decisions.</p>
