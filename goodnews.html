          <h2>New Research Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Originate from Tang Dynasty China</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice was originally a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty. The theory is based on stylistic similarities to Chinese mythical beasts and lead isotope analysis tracing the bronze to the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate the massive statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo. However, this claim is being met with skepticism from some scholars in China who dispute the artifact's proposed origins and journey.</p>

          <p>The film 'The Smashing Machine,' starring Dwayne Johnson, chronicles the life of pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr, whose career was marked by both dominance in the ring and a severe battle with opioid addiction. The article details the long journey of the project, which originated from a 2002 documentary of the same name and a chance meeting between Johnson and Kerr in 1997. After years of personal struggles, including alcoholism and career decline, Kerr found sobriety and reconnected with Johnson to bring his story to the screen. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, has received critical acclaim, offering Kerr a second chance at public recognition.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) to cease all offensive military actions in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive measures. This move is in alignment with President Donald Trump's proposed 20-point peace plan, with Israel working in full coordination with the U.S. administration. A top priority is securing the release of all hostages, and Israel is preparing to send a negotiating team to discussions that may occur in Cairo. Palestinian militant groups have expressed support for Hamas's response to the ceasefire proposal, indicating a unified stance among Palestinian resistance forces.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully completed "States of Elevation," a grueling endurance project where he summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The challenge involved cycling over 3,000 miles between peaks and then running up each one, a feat equivalent to a daily marathon and Tour de France stage. Jornet, known for setting speed records on the world's most famous mountains, undertook this project not for records but to explore new landscapes and push his physical limits. The article highlights his minimalist and artistic approach, choosing the "most aesthetic line" through the mountains to appreciate their beauty and advocate for wilderness preservation.</p>

It discusses the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and Albert Einstein's unusual divorce settlement, where he promised his future prize money to his wife. The piece also explores why there is no prize for mathematics and sheds light on female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, whose crucial contributions were overlooked by the committee. Furthermore, it notes that the prize has never been revoked, even for recipients whose scientific discoveries, like the lobotomy, were later discredited as harmful.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish security stance and opposition to progressive social policies, such as allowing married women to retain their maiden names. Her election comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after a series of election defeats and scandals. Takaichi faces the immediate challenges of addressing a sluggish economy, navigating relations with the U.S., and uniting a fractured party.</p>

          <p>The 1998 BBC documentary 'Premier Passions' offered an unprecedented, raw look inside Sunderland AFC during their dramatic 1996-97 Premier League season, which ended in relegation. The series is remembered for its unfiltered access, including manager Peter Reid's expletive-laden team talks, and for documenting a pivotal era of change in English football as the club prepared to leave its historic Roker Park stadium. Former club chairman Sir Bob Murray reflects on the period as a necessary "new beginning" to modernize the club despite financial constraints. The documentary captured the heartache and passion of the fans and staff, leaving a lasting legacy on sports broadcasting.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, known as the perigee, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox and is notable for rising around sunset for several evenings in a row. Weather permitting, sky-gazers will be able to witness the brightest lunar event of the year so far.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pragmatic Acceptance of Hamas's Conditional Response Aims to Secure a Mideast Peace Deal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 23:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's decision to accept Hamas's conditional response to his 20-point peace plan is a pragmatic, deal-making move designed to end the Gaza war. Despite Hamas's statement falling short of an unconditional agreement, Trump framed it as an acceptance and immediately called on Israel to halt its bombing campaign. This puts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a difficult position, as Trump prioritizes the immediate release of all hostages over Hamas's complete disarmament at this stage. The author argues this reflects Trump's unorthodox, non-ideological style and his ambition to achieve a significant foreign policy victory.</p>
