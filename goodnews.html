        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic indicated he is leaning towards only one interest rate cut this year, balancing potential inflation pressures with recession worries. Bostic expressed concerns about rising inflation expectations following a consumer sentiment survey highlighting fears of tariffs driving prices higher. While not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, Bostic emphasized his worry about the inflation side of the Fed's dual mandate, noting that troublesome movements in expectations could complicate the Fed's job. He also acknowledged that even reduced tariffs are economically significant, impacting the central bank's considerations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw the political center narrowly fend off challenges from hard-right nationalist forces. In Romania, centrist mayor Nicusor Dan defeated hard-line nationalist George Simion, who had aligned himself with President Trump. Poland's election saw liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski secure a spot in a runoff against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki, though hard-right candidates garnered significant support. These elections highlight growing discontent with established political parties and the fragmentation of nationalist movements, suggesting potential future political turbulence.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at strengthening security cooperation and reducing trade barriers introduced by Brexit. The deal allows British people to use electronic gates in Europe, eases pet travel, and resumes the sale of some British meat products in the EU. A key component involves allowing European boats access to U.K. fishing waters until June 30, 2038, which has drawn criticism from Brexit supporters. The agreement also includes plans for a "youth experience" program to facilitate travel and work opportunities for young Europeans in Britain and vice versa, though details are still under negotiation.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the public is ready to move on from Brexit as the UK and EU reach a new deal on post-Brexit relations. Starmer's goal is to make the agreement seem as insignificant and uncontroversial as possible. The view within the government is that there is no public desire to reopen the major questions of Brexit, such as membership of the single market and customs union. Pragmatism, however, is in the eye of the beholder, with Conservatives criticizing the deal as a "surrender" and Reform UK making similar arguments.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns. CDs allow you to lock in today's high rates for the term, and they generally come with FDIC or NCUA insurance. The current national average CD rates vary by term, with 1-year CDs yielding around 2.00% APY. To get a good CD rate, consider looking at online banks, which often offer more competitive rates, and consider short-term CDs, which may have higher interest rates than longer terms.

          <p>Navigating the housing market can be challenging due to high mortgage rates and limited inventory. However, securing a good rate is still possible, especially with a strong credit score. As of May 19, 2025, average mortgage rates are 6.03% for a 15-year mortgage and 6.84% for a 30-year mortgage. Taylor Jessee, CFP, suggests that if the Fed stops raising rates, mortgage rates may also stabilize.
