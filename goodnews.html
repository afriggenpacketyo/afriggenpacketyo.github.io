          <p>In a marked departure from a previous tense meeting, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky adopted a more diplomatic approach during his recent visit to the White House. Accompanied by European leaders, Zelensky focused on securing security guarantees and discussing a potential meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. While no concrete agreements were finalized, Zelensky mentioned a possible $90 billion U.S. arms deal and appeared upbeat, successfully avoiding confrontation and buying more time for Ukraine's diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. Over the last five years, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. Analysts suggest that ongoing trade uncertainties and China's domestic slowdown are motivating Chinese firms to increasingly focus on developing nations, potentially shifting the center of global commerce toward South-South trade.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that while he believes investors are currently overexcited about artificial intelligence, creating a bubble with "insane" valuations, the technology's long-term importance is not overestimated. He warned that some investors will likely get "very burnt" but maintained that the societal value created by AI will be tremendous. Altman also signaled OpenAI's aggressive spending strategy, expecting to invest trillions in datacenter construction to meet the growing demand for AI compute power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Zelensky in Washington, Russian President Vladimir Putin reached out to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to discuss a separate, China-linked peace initiative. Putin reportedly briefed Lula on his "positive" meeting with Trump and praised Brazil's involvement in the "Group of Friends for Peace," a joint effort with China. This diplomatic move highlights Russia's strategy of engaging multiple international partners, though Ukraine has previously rejected this specific initiative, viewing it as serving Moscow's interests.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky learned from a contentious February meeting with Donald Trump, arriving at the most recent White House talks with a new, more conciliatory strategy. By dressing in a suit, expressing gratitude, and avoiding confrontation, Zelensky successfully managed the meeting's tone, in stark contrast to the previous encounter. This shift, encouraged by European allies, helped keep the focus on substantive issues like security guarantees and a potential ceasefire, preventing the discussion from descending into personal acrimony.</p>

          <p>MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has indicated that future league expansion could provide an opportunity to geographically realign teams, potentially doing away with the traditional American and National Leagues in favor of Eastern and Western Conferences. He argued that such a move would reduce travel wear on players and create more appealing postseason broadcast schedules, particularly for West Coast audiences. While the idea may face resistance from traditionalists, Manfred believes it is a logical step to take when the league expands beyond its current 30 teams.</p>

The action makes the substance a Schedule 1 controlled substance in the state, empowering law enforcement to make arrests for its possession or sale.
