        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Car buyers are flocking to dealerships to capitalize on federal tax credits for electric vehicles before they expire on September 30th. The credits, offering $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, were introduced under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act but are being phased out. This impending deadline has spurred a significant surge in EV demand, with sales reaching record highs in August and dealers offering additional incentives to clear inventory. While some experts predict a potential sales drop-off in October, others believe the impact will be minimal due to initially modest sales figures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article breaks down the monthly repayment costs for a $40,000 home equity loan following the recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. It compares current costs for 10- and 15-year loans to previous rates from earlier in the year and the prior year, showing a slight decrease in monthly payments. The piece also contrasts fixed-rate home equity loans with variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer slightly lower initial payments but carry the risk of future rate increases.

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker, serving as a judge for this year's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction, described the process of selecting the six-book shortlist as "real agony." Parker and her fellow judges whittled down a longlist of 13 novels, a process she called a privilege despite the difficult decisions. The final shortlist includes past winner Kiran Desai, previous nominees Andrew Miller and David Szalay, and three American authors: Susan Choi, Katie Kitamura, and Ben Markovits. The winner of the highly regarded literary award will be announced at a ceremony in London in November.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on a forested property in Pembroke, Maine. The landowner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the state's wildlife department. In a five-hour operation, a biologist sedated the moose, and wardens used straps and an excavator to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedation wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed. The family who owns the land was unaware of the well's existence and has since capped it to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>Health officials and medical regulators worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are pushing back against President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy is linked to autism. These organizations state that available scientific evidence does not support a causal relationship and reaffirm that the medication is an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. They caution that avoiding necessary treatment can pose real risks to both the mother and the fetus, and they also refuted Trump's separate claims about vaccines causing autism.</p>

          <p>England has named its squad for the upcoming Ashes tour in Australia, featuring what is being described as its most hostile group of fast bowlers in decades. The attack, including Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's pace on their home pitches. The article notes the absence of veteran James Anderson for the first time in over 20 years, signaling a strategic shift. While the pace attack is promising, concerns remain about the durability of several key bowlers and the fitness of captain Ben Stokes, whose presence is considered crucial for England's chances.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement an automated ball-strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," starting in the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still making the initial calls on the field. Each team will be allowed to challenge two ball or strike calls per game, with the ABS technology making the final determination. The move, which has been tested extensively in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and potentially reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to disputed calls at the plate.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has reiterated his positive outlook on Boeing, citing reports that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive aircraft order. Cramer's investment thesis is that countries looking to reduce their trade deficits with the U.S. can do so by purchasing Boeing planes, a pattern observed with recent deals involving Japan, Korea, and Middle Eastern nations. The potential China deal, along with other recent orders from Turkey and Uzbekistan, is seen as a significant catalyst for the aircraft manufacturer's stock, reinforcing the bull case for the company.

The remarks come amid a campaign by the White House to increase its influence over the independent agency. Powell reiterated that the Fed's recent rate cut was driven by economic data indicating rising risks to employment alongside persistent inflation concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Originally developed a decade ago as a series of museum installations, the updated VR experience is now available on modern headsets like the Apple Vision Pro. The project allows users to navigate an austere Icelandic landscape and interact with visual metaphors representing the artist's heartbreak. The remaster takes advantage of modern technology to offer improved graphics, spatial audio, and more intuitive navigation than the original, clunky versions.</p>

This marks the first time students have been helped to leave the war-torn region to study in the UK since the conflict began. After being taken to Jordan for visa processing, the students are now enrolling at universities across the country. While celebrating the opportunity, advocates note the students face the difficult process of adjusting while their families remain in Gaza, and have criticized rules preventing them from bringing relatives.</p>
