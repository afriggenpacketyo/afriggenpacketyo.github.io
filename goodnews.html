          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, expressed optimism that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance following another round of talks with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa noted that discussions were frank and in-depth, suggesting progress toward an agreement. He reiterated Japan's call for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the U.S. The talks took place after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump agreed that forthcoming discussions should be productive, with hopes for a face-to-face meeting in June. </p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has approved a plan by Nippon Steel Corp. to acquire United States Steel Corp., a White House official said Friday. Trump stated that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the American economy. The move comes after a panel of federal agencies screened the buyout plan, reversing a previous decision by the Biden administration to block the initiative on national security grounds. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel praised the decision in separate statements.</p>

          <p>A water leak affected all seven floors of a recently constructed high-tech computer science building at USC, causing damage to labs and equipment. The leak originated from the attic of Ginsburg Hall, which opened in September with a $130-million budget. The building houses advanced technology, including a robotics lab and a two-story lab for autonomous aerial vehicles. Researchers were notified to check their equipment, and the building was closed for repairs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that Anna's Hummingbirds in the western United States have evolved due to the prevalence of hummingbird feeders, changing the size and shape of their beaks. The beaks became longer and more slender to better access nectar, and males' beaks became pointier for fighting off competitors. The hummingbirds' range also expanded northward, influenced by both feeders and the abundance of eucalyptus forests. The study highlights how quickly evolution can occur in response to human influence.</p>

This visit comes amid tensions with US President Donald Trump, with Jeremy Kinsman, former Canadian high commissioner to the UK, emphasizing the significance of the King's affirmation of Canadian sovereignty. The King's speech, written on the advice of Canada's government, is expected to convey a message of solidarity without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US.

          <p>Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp says he turned off his television when he heard supporters booing Trent Alexander-Arnold. Alexander-Arnold arrived at the club aged six and was a key component in Liverpool's success under German Klopp, which included a first league title in 30 years in 2019-20. However after announcing his decision to not sign a new contract, some fans turned against the player and some booed him when he came off the substitutes bench against Arsenal earlier this month. Klopp said supporters were "wrong" to boo and launched a passionate defence of the England full-back.</p>
