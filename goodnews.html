          <p>British cyclist Simon Yates delivered a remarkable performance in the Giro d'Italia's penultimate stage, overtaking Isaac del Toro to claim his second Grand Tour title. Yates launched a decisive attack on the Colle delle Finestre, overcoming a previous setback at the same location in 2018. His Visma-Lease A Bike teammate, Wout van Aert, played a crucial role by being in the breakaway group and aiding Yates in building a substantial lead during the final 30km.

These include trusting your instincts, following cultural traditions, and paying attention to your child's individual interests.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on a patient's spine through her eye. The patient, Karla Flores, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, but a misplaced MRI revealed a second tumor on her spine. The surgeons developed a unique "third nostril" approach, removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor.
