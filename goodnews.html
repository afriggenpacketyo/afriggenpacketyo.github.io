          <p>A surge of visitors is flocking to Vladimir Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square ahead of its scheduled closure for repairs until 2027. The renewed interest is less about Soviet nostalgia and more about a final opportunity to see the preserved body of the revolutionary leader, whose potential burial has been debated for years. This phenomenon highlights a unique intersection of history, science, and public curiosity in modern Russia, where a relic of the past continues to draw crowds. The temporary closure prompts reflections on the permanence of historical symbols.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising household debt driven by high interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments, financial experts are highlighting several debt relief options. These strategies range from disciplined repayment methods like the debt snowball or avalanche, to consolidation using personal loans or balance transfer cards. For those with more severe debt, options include debt management plans (DMPs) through credit counseling agencies, debt settlement, or, as a last resort, bankruptcy. Experts emphasize that the best approach depends on an individual's specific financial situation and credit score, urging proactive measures to address debt problems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 after she bit off part of her sexual attacker's tongue to defend herself. At 19, Choi was given a suspended prison sentence, while her attacker received a lesser penalty for trespassing. Now 61 years later, inspired by the #MeToo movement, her case is being retried, with prosecutors issuing a formal apology and asking the court to overturn the original conviction. Choi's long fight for justice highlights shifting societal and legal perspectives on self-defense in cases of sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Lawler has announced he will run for reelection in his competitive Hudson Valley House district, ending speculation that he would seek the New York governorship in 2026. Lawler stated his focus is on helping maintain the Republican House majority, a seat he noted was determinative in both 2022 and 2024. His decision clears the field for other potential GOP gubernatorial candidates, such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, who President Trump had previously appeared to favor. Lawler's district is a key target for Democrats, making his reelection campaign critical for the GOP's narrow control of the House.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon are launching a new platform allowing institutional clients to purchase tokenized money market funds, with ownership recorded on a blockchain. This initiative, which already includes major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, aims to transform the $7.1 trillion money market industry by increasing efficiency and enabling faster, 24/7 transactions. Unlike stablecoins, these tokenized funds pay a yield, making them an attractive option for corporate cash management. The banks believe this move will create a more efficient financial ecosystem and could allow the funds to be used as collateral without first converting them to cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman, which captured a young woman and a child falling from a collapsed fire escape during a Boston apartment fire, had a profound and lasting impact on public safety. The photo, which won a Pulitzer Prize, depicted the death of 19-year-old Diana Bryant, though the 2-year-old she was with survived. The powerful image spurred the city of Boston to enact new regulations within months, requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years. This tragic event and its documentation serve as a powerful example of how photojournalism can drive significant and life-saving policy changes.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the directions given to the juries in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had argued that their actions were common practice and known to their superiors, and that they were made scapegoats for a wider industry issue. The ruling concludes a decade-long legal battle and has led to calls for a public inquiry into such prosecutions.</p>

          <p>Australian rugby wing Harry Potter has rejected criticism from figures like Sir Clive Woodward, who claimed the Wallabies have a "losing mentality." The critique followed Australia's loss in the first Test against the British and Irish Lions, where the captain's decision to end the game by kicking the ball out was questioned. Potter defended his team, stating it's "ridiculous" to suggest the players didn't intend to win and that they are focused on learning from the defeat. With the series on the line, Potter emphasized that the team understands the high stakes of the upcoming second Test.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Democratic state representative and aspiring minister from Texas, has emerged as a potential progressive star after a widely discussed appearance on "The Joe Rogan Experience." Talarico, known for his viral clips challenging Republican colleagues on issues like Christian nationalism, used the platform to discuss his progressive Christian faith. His ability to articulate his views in a typically right-leaning forum has generated significant buzz and speculation about a potential run for higher office, such as the U.S. Senate. This marks a notable rise for a politician who aims to counter the far-right's influence in Texas politics.</p>

This new software allows designers to manage a vast number of variables without increasing the computational load. To illustrate its effectiveness, the researchers pointed to the canceled U.S. Navy X-47B drone program, which struggled with trade-offs between stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion. The Chinese team asserts their system can achieve dramatic improvements by optimizing hundreds of variables simultaneously, potentially revolutionizing aircraft design.</p>

          <p>The sea slug Elysia chlorotica exhibits a remarkable biological feat by stealing chloroplasts from the algae it consumes and incorporating them into its own body to perform photosynthesis. This process of "creative borrowing," or symbiosis, allows the slug to sustain itself with light, blurring the lines between animal and plant. This creature serves as a compelling example for a broader scientific theory, championed by biologist Lynn Margulis, that symbiosis is a major driving force of evolution, not just random mutation. The study of such organisms is prompting scientists to reconsider how interactions between different species fundamentally shape life and evolution.</p>

          <p>Ari Aster's latest film, "Eddington," is a surreal neo-Western that channels the anxiety and conspiratorial thinking of the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie follows a small-town sheriff, played by Joaquin Phoenix, whose paranoia and desire for control escalate into a violent, darkly comedic spectacle. The article draws parallels to Martin Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," where the viewer is immersed in the perspective of a disturbed protagonist who sees himself as a hero. "Eddington" satirizes the extreme politicization and misinformation of the lockdown era, culminating in a chaotic and absurd showdown that questions the nature of justice and control.</p>
