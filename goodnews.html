          <h2>David Souter, Former Supreme Court Justice, Passes Away at 85</h2>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush, passed away peacefully at his home at the age of 85. Souter, despite being a Republican appointee, became a consistent member of the court's liberal wing, often frustrating Republicans with his alignment with liberal justices. He played a crucial role in decisions such as reaffirming Roe v. Wade and dissenting in Bush v. Gore. After retiring in 2009, Souter returned to New Hampshire but continued to serve on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, leaving behind a legacy of judicial independence and intellectual rigor.</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, a Republican appointed to the Supreme Court by George H.W. Bush, died at 85, after a nearly two-decade tenure that saw him become a key member of the court's liberal wing, much to the disappointment of conservatives. Souter, a private individual who preferred books to Washington society, retired relatively early at 69, providing Barack Obama with a Supreme Court vacancy. The article emphasizes Souter's commitment to the Constitution as a living document and his belief in the judiciary's role in addressing social problems, which often put him at odds with conservative expectations, particularly in cases involving abortion rights and federalism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump referred to the U.S.-Canada border as an "artificially drawn line," suggesting it should be erased, which sparked debate about the border's historical and cultural significance. The border, largely following the 49th parallel, was established through treaties between the U.S. and Britain and shaped by considerations of fur trade and river systems. While technically man-made, the border has real-world consequences, affecting Indigenous territories and daily life for those living near it. Experts emphasize that dismissing the border as artificial downplays its complex history and importance to North American life.</p>

          <p>Xabi Alonso, coach of Bayer Leverkusen, confirmed his departure from the club at the end of the season, a year before his contract's expiration. Alonso cited the need for clarity as the reason for the announcement, with speculation mounting about his future career moves. While declining to comment on his next destination, reports suggest a potential return to Real Madrid to replace Carlo Ancelotti. Alonso's departure marks the end of a highly successful period for Leverkusen, during which he led the team to their first Bundesliga title and a German Cup victory, transforming them from perennial underachievers to champions.</p>

          <p>The recently established trade agreement between the UK and the US has averted imminent job losses at Jaguar Land Rover's plant in the West Midlands, according to the British ambassador to the US. The deal, which reduces tariffs on car exports from 27.5% to 10%, was crucial in preventing JLR from implementing planned cuts among its 30,000 employees in Solihull. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds emphasized the seriousness of the situation, stating that thousands of jobs in the automotive sector were at risk without the agreement, which has been hailed by JLR's chief executive as securing certainty for the industry and its workforce.</p>

          <p>While Chinese citizens celebrated the reported combat success of the J-10C fighter jet in the India-Pakistan conflict, Beijing has maintained a cautious stance, likely due to geopolitical considerations and military prudence. Pakistan claimed to have used the Chinese-made J-10C to shoot down Indian Rafale fighter jets, marking the J-10 family's first combat success. The Chinese government and official media have largely remained quiet, with the foreign ministry urging both sides to exercise restraint. China's restraint is partly due to its diplomatic relationship with both India and Pakistan, the latter being a key buyer of Chinese arms.</p>

Experts in the video emphasized that China's adoption of "intelligent manufacturing" enables unmanned 24-hour production, adapting to different missile variants to accelerate production and reduce costs.

          <p>The Soviet-era Venera mission lander Cosmos 482, which failed to leave Earth's orbit in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Unlike most space debris, Cosmos 482 was built to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, potentially allowing it to survive its Earth reentry. Weighing 495 kilograms and measuring 1.17 meters in diameter, it poses a greater risk than average space debris, although the annual risk of injury from space debris remains low. The re-entry is uncontrolled, but experts are tracking its descent, with predictions indicating it will re-enter in the early hours of May 10 (UTC).</p>

          <p>Ofcom has launched investigations into two pornographic websites, Itai Tech Ltd and Score Internet Group LLC, for allegedly failing to comply with the UK's new online safety regulations regarding age verification. These regulations, set to take effect in July, require all websites featuring pornographic content to implement robust age-checking mechanisms to prevent access by children. Ofcom stated that the two services under investigation did not appear to have effective age verification measures in place. Firms found to be in violation of the Act could face significant fines.</p>
