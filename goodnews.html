          <p>Two members of the 'Puro Tango Blast' gang in South Texas have been sentenced for human smuggling after a series of high-speed chases at the border. Juan Miguel Regalado received a 66-month sentence, while Samuel Grajeda Jr. was sentenced to 30 months plus six months for violating supervised release. Regalado once crashed a vehicle into the Rio Grande to evade law enforcement, and both were involved in another pursuit where Grajeda crashed into a bystander's vehicle. ICE officials emphasized the serious consequences awaiting those who engage in human smuggling and endanger public safety. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating research into offshore 'blue carbon' methods, aiming to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of these projects. This initiative aims to help Japan achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, supplementing existing forest-based carbon capture efforts, as Japan hopes to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon. </p>

          <p>The Senate has advanced a crypto regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act, to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins after initial Democratic opposition over concerns about President Trump's ties to the digital asset industry.

Senator Mark Warner advocated for the measure, calling it a 'meaningful step forward,' while Senator Elizabeth Warren expressed concerns that it puts consumers at risk and enables corruption. The bill aims to provide clear rules of the road to protect consumers, defend national security, and support responsible innovation. </p>
