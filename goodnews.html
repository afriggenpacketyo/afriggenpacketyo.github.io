          <p>Following a strong debut on Wall Street, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that shares of the Swedish online lender Klarna remain a potential purchase, noting its valuation has not yet reached excessive levels. He highlighted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and "impressive underwriting standards," despite it being currently unprofitable due to investments in market expansion. Cramer compared Klarna's potential favorably to profitable peers like Affirm, though he did note that the IPO primarily benefited existing shareholders rather than funding company growth.

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," Jim Cramer reminisced about the evolution of market sentiment, noting a return to investor optimism reminiscent of the show's early days. He recalled a time when more individuals were excited about single stocks, a mindset that faded after the dot-com bubble burst and index funds became favored for their perceived safety. Cramer suggests that today's investors are once again recognizing the potential for significant gains in individual stocks like Nvidia and Oracle. He believes this renewed interest is driven by awareness of rapid growth opportunities, not just greed.</p>

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the U.S. to protect its leadership in artificial intelligence from rapid advancements by China. Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the U.S. lead has narrowed significantly and proposed exporting integrated "AI tech stacks"—which include chips, algorithms, and applications—to global partners. This strategy aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to solidify a U.S.-led AI ecosystem. The plan also involves coordinating with allies on export controls to keep adversaries out of defense supply chains.</p>

          <p>Online real estate platform Opendoor announced significant leadership changes, appointing former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and naming co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news prompted a 30% surge in the company's stock during extended trading, continuing a dramatic recovery from a record low in June. These changes follow the resignation of former CEO Carrie Wheeler after a period of intense investor pressure for her departure. The move is seen as a major strategic shift for the company, which has recently attracted significant interest from retail investors.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Investigate 'Dark DNA' to Understand Peacock Spiders' Extreme Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 19:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders, which have over 100 known species, to understand their extraordinary diversity. Scientists believe the key may lie in 'dark DNA'—the non-gene portions of the genetic code—which constitutes a much larger part of the spider's genome compared to humans. This dark DNA might enable the spiders to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. By cataloging the behaviors, appearances, and genetics of every species, researchers hope to uncover the mechanisms behind this rapid variation, which could provide broader insights into biodiversity and evolution across the natural world.</p>

          <p>A new cooperation agreement between financial institutions in China and Kazakhstan is expected to boost cross-border e-commerce and trade between the two nations. Timur Turlov, CEO of Freedom Holding, stated the pact will simplify payments by opening channels in both yuan and U.S. dollars, fostering interoperable platforms for digital finance. This development reflects the deepening economic relationship, with Kazakhstan being a primary destination for China's Belt and Road Initiative investments. The collaboration aims to integrate Kazakhstan more closely with China's extensive e-commerce ecosystem, including platforms like WeChat and payment gateways like UnionPay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has voted to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The bipartisan measure, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, reflects a growing concern in Congress that leaving these decades-old authorizations in place risks abuse by presidents seeking to justify new military actions. Proponents argue that it is a necessary step for Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. The amendment is attached to the annual defense spending bill and follows previous unsuccessful attempts to revoke the outdated war powers.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic started, COVID-19 is no longer among the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary CDC data for 2024.

Overall U.S. death rates have also decreased for the third consecutive year. Heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, accounting for over 40% of all fatalities, highlighting the persistent challenge of chronic diseases in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an emergency request from South Carolina to enforce its law banning transgender students from using bathrooms that align with their gender identity. The decision allows a temporary injunction from a lower court to remain in place, permitting a transgender ninth-grade student to continue using the boys' restroom while the legal case proceeds. The brief, unsigned order is not a ruling on the merits of the law but represents a procedural setback for the state. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch noted they would have granted South Carolina's request to enforce the ban.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed its long-standing policy and will now allow federal wildland firefighters to wear N95 masks to protect them from smoke inhalation. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations like Canada and Australia. The decision follows reports highlighting the health risks firefighters face, including a higher risk of cancer, and pressure from lawmakers to improve safety standards. The agency has stockpiled 80,000 masks to be deployed for crews battling the nation's increasingly intense wildfires.</p>

The former "Match of the Day" host's victory comes after he departed the BBC football show in May following controversies related to his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker suggested the viewer-voted award demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for others. Other major winners of the night included the finale of "Gavin and Stacey" for best comedy and the Netflix hit "Adolescence" for best new drama.</p>

          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has stated that the era of "super cycles" for Apple's iPhone may be over unless the company delivers significant innovations in artificial intelligence. He argued that devices are increasingly software-driven, and without a compelling leap in AI capabilities, new iPhones risk being seen as merely incremental upgrades. Stankey's comments reflect a growing investor concern that Apple is lagging behind competitors like Google and Microsoft in the AI race. He predicted that the upcoming iPhone 17 would not generate the massive lines and record-breaking sales of the past without unique and indispensable AI features.</p>

Ellison's net worth jumped to $393 billion, edging past Musk's $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock rally was driven by Oracle's optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business, which has seen a surge in demand. Although Musk reclaimed the top spot by the end of the day as Oracle's shares moderated, the event highlights the shifting fortunes in the tech industry, with Musk's Tesla facing recent headwinds.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's fantastic performance as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot, and noted the fashion industry's initial concern that the character would be a caricature. The review comes as a sequel to the film has been announced for a 2026 release.</p>
