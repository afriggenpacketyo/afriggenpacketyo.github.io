          <p>OpenAI announced it would restructure into a public benefit corporation while maintaining nonprofit control, bowing to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees. The decision followed discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware, with the nonprofit retaining control over OpenAI's mission. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing the shared mission between the nonprofit and the public benefit corporation. The article also notes that the restructuring will not affect Elon Musk's ongoing legal battle against the company.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but this claim is inaccurate. According to AAA, U.S. drivers are paying an average of $3.165 per gallon. The price of RBOB gasoline futures, which touched $1.98 per gallon, does not reflect what consumers pay at the pump as it excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs. Experts state that the RBOB price is irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>New York City has ended its Land Acquisition Program in the Catskills, which has been in place since 1997 to protect the city's drinking water by purchasing land in the watershed. The city accumulated over 156,000 acres to prevent pollution and avoid filtration costs. The decision to end the program came after an independent review found that further land purchases would be of little benefit. The city will now focus on a Collaborative Streamside Acquisition Program, which requires local approval for land transactions.</p>
