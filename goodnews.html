          <h2>Trump Claims Ceasefire Between Iran and Israel Following US Strikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 22:01:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, stating that it could lead to lasting peace, though neither country has definitively confirmed the agreement. White House officials are touting this as a diplomatic breakthrough after US airstrikes targeted Iranian nuclear facilities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi indicated that Iran would cease its response if Israel halted its aggression, and Israeli attacks reportedly stopped as the deadline approached. The development follows a day of heightened tensions, including Iranian missile attacks on a US base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted without casualties or damage.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers have lauded President Trump for brokering a ceasefire between Iran and Israel following US strikes on Iranian nuclear enrichment sites. Democrats, however, are withholding their congratulations, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arguing that Trump's admission of unilaterally engaging the US in a war without congressional approval is a grave and illegal act. Republicans praised Trump's negotiating prowess and asserted that the ceasefire demonstrates American strength, while Democrats like Rep. Thomas Massie are taking a wait-and-see approach before deciding whether to continue pushing for congressional approval for military actions against Iran.</p>

          <p>Rio Tinto and Hancock Prospecting will invest $1.61 billion to develop the Hope Downs 2 iron ore project in Western Australia's Pilbara region. The project, a joint venture between the two companies, includes the Hope Downs 2 and Bedded Hilltop deposits, with each party holding equal stakes. The two iron ore pits will have a combined annual production capacity of 31 million metric tons, with ore transported to Hope Downs 1 for processing. First iron ore from the project is scheduled for 2027, and Rio Tinto expects to invest over $13 billion on new mines, plant, and equipment in the next three years.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Lord Richard Hermer stated that a commitment to international law is central to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government and its approach to foreign policy. Hermer defended Starmer's strategy of maintaining a 'warm' relationship with President Trump, arguing it has facilitated economic deals with the US, India, and the EU. He emphasized that being a good faith player in international law is in the national interest, as it fosters trust and enables successful trade and migration agreements. Hermer also addressed past controversy over remarks comparing calls to depart from international law to arguments made in 1930s Germany.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing its plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, citing the university's free speech rights under the US Constitution's first amendment. Harvard alleges that Trump is retaliating against it for refusing to accede to the administration's demands regarding governance, curriculum, and ideology. The ruling prevents the administration from blocking international students from attending the university, which has faced previous challenges from the administration.</p>

The charity says that almost half of young people referred to mental health services also have serious speech and language challenges. Speech and Language UK wants better training in speech and language for teachers and school support staff, as well as mental health professionals, and better information sharing between schools and mental health teams to spot language issues in children at an early age. The government has committed to providing access to mental health support in every secondary school in England by 2030.</p>

The DIY test kits aim to tackle barriers like embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending screenings. The kits contain a cotton-wool bud to swab the lining of the vagina and test for human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes most cervical cancers. The Department of Health said women who had rarely or never attended cervical screening would be offered a self-sample kit to complete at home, and women who test positive for HPV will be invited to see a doctor for further checks.</p>
