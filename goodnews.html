          <p>Following a candid interview by German long-distance runner Lea Meyer about her mental health struggles, a broader discussion has emerged in Germany about the culture of sport. Experts note a positive shift away from a sole focus on performance towards recognizing athletes as whole people, though challenges remain. Meyer's statement that her personal value is not defined by her athletic results has been highlighted as a significant moment in promoting a healthier identity for athletes. This conversation emphasizes proactive mental health support to build resilience in young competitors.</p>

          <p>India has announced it will reopen its embassy in Afghanistan, upgrading its technical mission four years after it was closed following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. The decision was revealed during a landmark visit to New Delhi by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, the first such trip by a senior Taliban leader. While India does not formally recognize the Taliban government, this move signals a significant diplomatic engagement aimed at enhancing cooperation, regional stability, and continuing India's historical role as a key provider of humanitarian aid.</p>

          <h2>Arizona Sheriff's Department Trials AI for Writing Incident Reports</h2>

          <p>The Pima County Sheriff's Department in Arizona is testing an AI program called Draft One to streamline the process of writing case reports. The technology uses audio from an officer's body camera to generate a first draft of a report, which the deputy then reviews and finalizes. Proponents argue this can save significant time, allowing officers to focus on other duties, but experts caution that the accuracy and potential biases of AI in law enforcement require careful oversight. The department emphasizes that a human officer must always verify and approve the final report.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group over Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The court ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which included serious accusations, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the heated context of a rap battle, rather than verifiable statements of fact. The judge noted that listeners would not expect factual reporting from a diss track filled with hyperbole and that Drake himself had used similar language in the feud. Drake's spokesperson has stated he plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has defended his era of the national team, often called the "golden generation," in response to recent critical comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard. Gerrard had suggested the team's lack of success was due to egotistical players who didn't function as a unit. Rooney acknowledged the presence of big personalities from rival clubs but disagreed with the assessment, stating that everyone worked hard and tried their best, and that the current generation simply benefits from a more positive media climate.</p>

This strategic positioning aims to cast Plaid Cymru not just as a party of protest or conscience, but as a credible government-in-waiting for voters seeking change after decades of Labour rule.</p>

          <p>The UK government is allocating an additional £36.5 million to London councils to help address the city's escalating homelessness crisis this winter. With one in 50 Londoners currently homeless and record numbers of children in temporary housing, the funding is considered critical. The investment will be directed towards preventing rough sleeping and providing support for families at risk of losing their homes. This move is part of a larger national fund, with the capital receiving the largest share to tackle its severe and growing problem.</p>
