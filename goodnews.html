          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek claimed her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 win against American Amanda Anisimova in a final lasting just 57 minutes. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the first woman since 1911 to win a Wimbledon final without dropping a single game. Anisimova, playing in her first major final, struggled with nerves, committing numerous unforced errors. Swiatek's win on grass, her previously weakest surface, solidifies her position as one of the game's top players.</p>

          <p>England hooker Jamie George has been called into the British and Irish Lions squad as a replacement ahead of the first Test against Australia. The call-up comes after fellow hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie suffered a suspected concussion during a match, making him a doubt for the upcoming game. George, a two-time Lions tourist, was preparing to co-captain England in Argentina but will now join the Lions squad in Brisbane. His Saracens teammate, Theo Dan, will replace him in England's starting lineup for their upcoming match.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, who leads the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador. His extradition would be the first since Ecuador approved the measure in a referendum aimed at combating organized crime. The U.S. considers his gang a major threat connected to Mexican drug cartels.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the 50 U.S. states based on the strength of their economies and their ability to withstand a potential recession.

Florida was ranked number one for the third consecutive year, praised for its strong growth and finances. Texas, North Carolina, Delaware, and Washington also placed in the top tier, noted for their diverse economies and relative insulation from certain economic shocks. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariff costs and trade uncertainty, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses. These designated areas allow businesses to import materials and components duty-free, delaying or reducing taxes until the finished products enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow and provides flexibility, especially as tariff rates fluctuate. However, recent changes by the Trump administration have eliminated some benefits, such as the "inverted tariff," creating new challenges for manufacturers relying on these zones.

          <p>Chris Kirby, founder of Ithaca Hummus, has grown his business from a small farmers market operation into a major brand expected to generate $50 million in revenue this year. Starting with just a $450 blender while he was a student at Cornell, Kirby identified a market gap for fresh, high-quality hummus. By focusing on slow, deep growth within regions rather than rapid national expansion, he built a strong brand identity and a profitable company. The business, now sold in over 8,000 stores, has achieved over $150 million in lifetime sales without taking on outside investors.</p>

          <p>New online safety regulations are set to take effect in the UK, legally requiring tech platforms to prevent children from seeing harmful content like pornography and material promoting self-harm. The rules, enforced by Ofcom, will mandate age verification systems, with non-compliant companies facing substantial fines. However, the measures are already facing criticism for not covering private messaging, AI chatbots, or misinformation. While campaigners and parents who lost children to online harms see it as a step forward, many, including some in government, acknowledge the rules are already outdated and need further updates.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its deep space exploration program, posing a significant challenge to long-held U.S. leadership in the field. The country aims to land two astronauts on the moon before 2030, with key hardware like the Mengzhou crew capsule and the Long March-10 rocket already in advanced development. While NASA's Artemis program officially targets an earlier moon landing, it faces significant technical hurdles, including the unproven concept of in-orbit refueling for its lander.
