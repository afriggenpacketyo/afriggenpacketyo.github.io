          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley has turned down an invitation to serve on a presidential council for sports, fitness, and nutrition being revitalized by Donald Trump. Barkley cited his busy schedule and a family decision as the reasons for declining the offer. The running back, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, stated he was shocked his name was mentioned but emphasized his respect for the office of the presidency.</p>

The campaign had previously drawn online criticism, with some accusing it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denied.

The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000 each. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace winners, particularly those with older, paper-based bonds or those who have moved without updating their contact details.</p>

The directive aims to establish a fission surface power system to support a future lunar economy and strengthen national security in space. This move is seen as a response to a joint effort by China and Russia to place their own reactor on the moon by the mid-2030s.</p>

          <p>Research from the American Cancer Society indicates that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people aged 45-49. Screening rates in this age group rose 62% from 2019 to 2023, which researchers believe is driving the detection of more treatable, early-stage cancers. Despite the promising trend, experts caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and are not equitable across all demographics.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has attributed the stock market's recent rebound to the strong earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He argued that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the market's strength is fundamentally based on the performance of these tech giants, which he described as cash-rich "nation states" with multiple revenue streams. Cramer suggested their financial success is robust enough to overcome broader economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Birmingham woman, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered in 2020 with a legally held shotgun, says new, tighter firearm restrictions in the UK make her feel hopeful. Emma Ambler has campaigned for stricter laws since the tragedy, where her sister's partner lied on his gun application. The new rules, which took effect August 5, require more referees for shotgun applications and mandate police checks for domestic abuse signs to prevent unsuitable individuals from accessing firearms.</p>

          <p>Defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Rheinmetall have successfully completed the first live-fire test of the Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System (GMARS). Produced in Europe, the wheeled launcher can carry two munitions pods, giving it double the capacity of the U.S. HIMARS system, and can fire the same family of guided rockets and ballistic missiles. The test reflects a growing global demand for mobile long-range precision fire systems, spurred by their effectiveness in the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has spent over $5 million in the last six months fighting the Trump administration in court, resulting in savings of nearly $170 billion for the state.
