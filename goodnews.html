          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) hosted a league event inside the Intuit Dome, the home of the NBA's Clippers, by trucking in 300 tons of sand. This move aimed to elevate the sport's professional image and attract a new, more diverse audience by creating a unique indoor spectacle. Players noted the different conditions, such as the lack of wind, which led to a faster, more power-focused game with tighter rallies. The event is seen as a potential blueprint for growing the sport beyond its traditional beach settings and reaching more fans who might not typically attend outdoor matches.</p>

          <p>Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed super lightweight titles via a controversial majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout concluded a highly anticipated trilogy, with this final fight, much like the previous two, being closely contested and leaving some observers questioning the judges' scorecards. Despite the controversy, the victory solidifies Taylor's legacy as one of the greatest female boxers, improving her record to 25-1. Following the demanding fight, Taylor acknowledged the immense pressure but remained non-committal about her future in the sport, stating she would take time to decide on retirement.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers forward Kobe Brown demonstrated his potential as a key rotational player before suffering a right ankle contusion during a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets. Brown was impressive, scoring 14 points in 20 minutes and showing versatility on both offense and defense before the injury forced him out of the game. The team described the move to hold him out as precautionary. In the same game, Jordan Miller, who was recently waived but re-signed for the summer roster, also stood out with 23 points and 11 rebounds, making a strong case for his future in the league.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, part of a larger 2022 agreement for nearly 1,000 tanks. This purchase underscores Poland's rapid military expansion in response to the war in Ukraine and its role as a key NATO frontline state. The deal also solidifies South Korea's position as a major global arms exporter, increasingly supplying US allies as American stockpiles are strained by conflicts. The agreement includes technology transfer and the establishment of a K2 production line in Poland, boosting its domestic defense industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a controversy over a recent design. The brand faced criticism after showcasing leather sandals at Milan Men's Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals, without acknowledging their Indian origin. In response to the outcry from Indian critics and craftspeople, Prada engaged in talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans. This move is seen as a step toward respectful collaboration between global fashion brands and traditional communities, and has prompted the Chamber to seek a patent for the footwear.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from conducting certain types of immigration raids in several Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, which alleged that federal agents were using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge found there was a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and specifically prohibited agents from making stops based solely on factors like race or accent. The order also requires that detained individuals be given access to legal counsel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists allege the company deceptively used their voices, which they provided for what they were told were internal purposes, to create and sell AI-generated voice clones on its platform. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings as training data will proceed. The case represents a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over creative work.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are undergoing a significant global expansion, establishing a growing number of overseas offices to support the international ventures of Chinese companies. This trend is driven by a preference among these companies for legal support from trusted domestic lawyers who understand their business culture. The number of Chinese legal offices abroad has increased by 70 percent since 2018, reflecting a pivotal moment for the country's legal services industry. While they are successfully serving their existing Chinese client base, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions and a different business environment.</p>

          <p>As the global market for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is projected to reach $150 billion, Chinese pharmaceutical firms are poised to enter the competition with at least 60 similar drugs currently under trial. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, much earlier than in other markets. This will likely open the door for many Chinese companies to launch cheaper, generic versions of the drug, significantly increasing affordability and access for patients. The development reflects a major push by China's domestic drug industry to capture a share of this lucrative market. (not investment advice)</p>
