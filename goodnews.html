          <p>Dr. Anna Chacon, a dermatologist, has achieved the rare feat of being licensed to practice in all 50 U.S. states, plus several territories. She invested approximately $180,000 of her own money to navigate the complex and costly state-by-state licensing processes, a move inspired by a desire for professional and financial security. This extensive credentialing allows her to run her Miami-based practice and see patients nationwide through telehealth, earning her over $870,000 in 2024. Chacon emphasizes that her national reach also enables her to provide care to underserved populations, including indigenous tribes in rural areas.</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight Challenges in Diagnosing and Treating Depression in Older Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 09:40:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mental health experts are drawing attention to the underdiagnosis of depression in older adults, which is often mistakenly attributed to the normal aging process. While symptoms are largely the same across age groups, depression in the elderly can present with more physical complaints, leading to misdiagnosis by both patients and doctors. Stigma also remains a significant barrier for older generations to seek help. Treatment is complicated by the fact that older patients are often on multiple medications for physical ailments, which can interact with antidepressants. Experts stress the importance of early diagnosis and addressing mental health concerns alongside physical ones.</p>

          <h2>New Red Bull Team Principal Prioritizes Car Performance to Retain Max Verstappen</h2>

          <p>Red Bull's new Formula 1 team principal, Laurent Mekies, has stated his top priority is improving the car's performance to ensure star driver Max Verstappen remains with the team. Verstappen is under contract until 2028 but has performance clauses that could allow an early exit, and he is reportedly being courted by Mercedes. Mekies, who recently took over from Christian Horner, believes that providing a fast car will eliminate any other considerations for Verstappen's future. His appointment follows a turbulent period for the team, which included an internal investigation into Horner and the departure of several key technical personnel.</p>

          <p>LaQuayia Goldring, a 35-year-old woman who spent ten years on dialysis, has received a life-saving kidney transplant just days after her story was highlighted on "CBS Sunday Morning." Goldring had been a vocal advocate for kidney disease patients, even using billboards to search for a donor. The new kidney came from a living donor, an unidentified man from Georgia. Dr. Malay Shah, who performed the surgery, noted that living-donor transplants have the best outcomes. Goldring plans to continue her advocacy, emphasizing the critical need for more living donors to help the nearly 90,000 people on the national transplant waiting list.</p>

          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that before her success, she would make $40 last for three days when she moved out on her own at 18. While driven by her passion for performing, she acknowledged the importance of financial security and being able to pay bills. The article contrasts her early, restrictive budgeting with modern financial advice for freelancers and gig workers. A financial expert suggests that instead of extreme rationing, those with fluctuating incomes should build a system that absorbs volatility, such as a "bucketing strategy" that allocates percentages of income to different categories.

          <h2>Savers Can Find Certificate of Deposit Rates That Outpace Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 08:40:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect and grow their money, with top rates currently exceeding the rate of inflation. CDs allow savers to lock in a fixed interest rate for a specific term and are considered safe investments, typically insured up to $250,000. While national average CD yields are modest, online banks often provide much more competitive rates, with some one-year CDs offering APYs above 4.40%. Financial experts suggest that savers can get the best returns by comparing offers from online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor in affordability. As of late July 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year loan averages around 6.01%. Experts note that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best possible rate, financial advisors recommend strengthening one's credit score, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders rather than only using one's current bank.

          <p>Medical professionals are highlighting several everyday habits that people often downplay but which can have detrimental health consequences.

Other cited behaviors are excessive caffeine intake, smoking, and consuming alcohol, even in moderation, which is linked to liver damage when combined with certain medications. Experts also stressed the dangers of inactivity, obesity, and failing to wear a helmet or seatbelt properly, urging people to take these simple preventative measures seriously to avoid long-term harm.</p>

          <p>Gated communities in the U.S. have expanded beyond enclaves for the wealthy and retirees, now catering to a wide range of budgets and lifestyles, particularly in states like Florida and California. While security is a feature, realtors note that the primary draw for many residents is the controlled access and the array of exclusive amenities, such as golf courses and concierge services. These communities typically have Homeowners Associations (HOAs) that enforce rules and collect fees, which can range from hundreds to thousands of dollars per month. Homes within these communities are often more expensive but also tend to have higher appreciation rates. (not investment advice)</p>
