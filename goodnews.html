          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at over $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan involves awarding Musk a significant number of shares contingent on the company achieving ambitious market capitalization, production, and profitability milestones. To fully vest, Tesla's market cap would need to reach $8.5 trillion, and the company would have to meet specific targets for vehicle deliveries, robotaxi production, and humanoid robot manufacturing. This proposal follows a previous $56 billion pay package that was voided by a Delaware judge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a press conference in São Paulo, Brazil, ahead of the Kansas City Chiefs' season opener, tight end Travis Kelce engaged in some lighthearted banter with his teammate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Kelce answered a question from the media by perfectly mimicking Mahomes' distinctive raspy voice, causing laughter in the room. He explained the impersonation was playful revenge for Mahomes previously joking that Kelce couldn't locate Brazil on a map. The interaction highlighted the team's positive morale as they prepared to face the Los Angeles Chargers to start their season.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a significant renovation project, aiming to "uplift" approximately 1,000 of its U.S. locations by the end of 2026 to create more inclusive and welcoming spaces. The redesigns will feature cozier elements like more seating and dark wood paneling, along with accessibility improvements such as less harsh lighting for customers with light sensitivity. This initiative is part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to restore the cafes' reputation as a "third place" for customers, reversing previous decisions that discouraged lingering. The company plans to invest around $150,000 per location for these makeovers.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the friendly match between the U.S. and South Korean men's national soccer teams, several key narratives surround the visiting squad. A major point of interest is the evolving role of star player Son Heung-min, whose captaincy is under review by coach Hong Myung-bo. The team also features Jens Castrop, the first player to switch national allegiance to play for South Korea, potentially setting a new trend. The match is seen as a crucial opportunity for a fresh start for the team under Coach Hong, who is under pressure to improve performance and establish a clear identity.</p>

          <p>At a White House dinner, Google CEO Sundar Pichai thanked President Donald Trump for a "constructive dialogue" following a favorable resolution in a major antitrust case against the company. A federal judge ruled against breaking up the company, a decision that added $230 billion to Alphabet's market capitalization. Pichai expressed his gladness that the long process was over and pivoted to discussing collaboration on artificial intelligence, praising the administration's AI action plan. The conversation occurred despite the fact that the antitrust lawsuit was initially filed by the Department of Justice during Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China are intensifying efforts to lead in artificial intelligence, with the city of Wenzhou becoming the first to establish a dedicated AI bureau. This new government body will manage AI policy, coordinate computing power and data resources, and promote "AI+" initiatives across various industries. The move is part of a broader national strategy to compete with the United States in the field of AI. Wenzhou is leveraging significant investments in digital infrastructure and green energy to support its ambitions, reflecting a trend of even second-tier cities playing a crucial role in China's tech race.</p>

          <p>Germany's new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, has emphasized that the government's climate protection agenda remains a top priority, despite having little prior experience in the field. During a tour of climate-focused projects, Schneider reaffirmed the national goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2045. His stance comes amidst internal debate within the coalition government, with some conservative members suggesting the targets are too ambitious and could hinder economic recovery. Schneider advocates for a calm, behind-the-scenes approach to build consensus both domestically and with international partners like China and India.</p>

In corporate news, shares of Danish wind farm developer Orsted were volatile after securing shareholder approval for a major rights issue.

          <p>A forecasting tournament designed to predict the progress of artificial intelligence found that both domain experts and generalist "superforecasters" significantly underestimated AI's advancement over the past three years. The study, conducted by the Forecasting Research Institute, revisited predictions made in 2022 and found that actual AI performance on several benchmarks surpassed what both groups had anticipated. For example, an AI achieved a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad years ahead of schedule. While AI experts were slightly more accurate, the results show the difficulty in predicting AI's trajectory.</p>

          <p>Researchers have determined that solar flares, powerful eruptions from the sun's surface, could reach temperatures as high as 180 million degrees Fahrenheit. This is more than six times hotter than previous estimates, which were based on measuring the temperature of electrons within the flares. New calculations and simulations suggest that ions, another type of particle in the flares, heat up significantly more than electrons, a difference that was previously overlooked. A better understanding of these extreme temperatures could help scientists protect satellites and astronauts from the dangerous effects of these solar events.</p>

England manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed that Stones arrived at the training camp with a muscular issue that has not resolved, and the decision was made not to take any risks. This is a setback for Tuchel, who has yet to have the experienced defender available during his tenure and views him as a key player with unique qualities. The injury leaves Marc Guehi, Dan Burn, Ezri Konsa, and Jarell Quansah as the remaining centre-back options for the two matches.</p>

          <p>A couple in northern France has been given suspended jail sentences and fines for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment. The case gained attention in 2019 when the young panther escaped onto a nearby rooftop, prompting a significant police and rescue operation. The owners claimed they saw the animal as an "affectionate baby," having purchased it from a traveling community. The court condemned the act as tantamount to species trafficking and mistreatment. The panther now lives safely at a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>In a notable turn in the New York City mayoral race, Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani has challenged President Donald Trump to a debate. The challenge came after independent candidate Andrew Cuomo called for debates with only Mamdani, urging other candidates to drop out. Mamdani responded by suggesting he would rather debate Trump directly than his "puppet," referencing reports that the White House is exploring ways to consolidate the field against him. The four-way race has become increasingly contentious, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa both insisting they will not withdraw from the election.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom rose by 0.6% in July, a stronger-than-expected increase attributed to sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), clothing, footwear, and online stores saw particularly strong growth. The release of this data was delayed by two weeks due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS apologized, admitting to errors in its seasonal adjustments. While the monthly figure was positive, sales over the three-month period to July were down compared to the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
