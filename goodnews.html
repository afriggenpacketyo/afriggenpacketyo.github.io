          <p>The Food and Drug Administration plans to use artificial intelligence in its drug approval processes to increase efficiency, especially after a Trump-driven reduction of nearly 2,000 employees.

          <p>The article critiques Britain's approach to free speech, arguing that it has a growing problem with censorship and restrictions on protest. It points to vague and outdated laws that give police excessive power to arrest individuals for online speech. The author also cites the crime and policing bill as an example of sweeping anti-protest legislation. The piece contends that the US, despite its own issues, currently offers greater freedom of speech than the UK. Optimism score of 55.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study indicates that Islam is the fastest-growing religion globally, followed by the religiously unaffiliated. The Muslim population increased significantly between 2010 and 2020 due to natural demographic growth.

The religiously unaffiliated group is now the third largest, with a notable increase in Europe and North America. Optimism score of 65.</p>
