          <p>President Donald Trump, at a news conference during the NATO summit in the Netherlands, celebrated the commitment of NATO allies to increase their defense spending. Trump announced that allies agreed to raise defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a goal previously deemed unattainable. This agreement, known as "The Hague Defense Commitment," is projected to add over $1 trillion annually toward common defense. Trump hailed the agreement as a monumental win for the United States, which he said was previously carrying more than its fair share, and for Europe and Western civilization.</p>
