          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) kept its policy rate steady at 0.5%, aligning with economic forecasts, as Japan's core inflation rate declined for a third consecutive month to 2.7% in August, its lowest since November 2024. Despite some dissent within the BOJ for a rate hike, the decision reflects a cautious stance amidst slowing inflation and global uncertainty. Analysts note this strategy supports a reflationary cycle, though calls for further hikes persist as headline inflation remains above the 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>
