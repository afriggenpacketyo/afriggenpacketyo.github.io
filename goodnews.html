          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump announced that her direct appeal to Russian President Vladimir Putin has resulted in the reunification of eight Ukrainian children with their families. She stated that an "open channel of communication" was established after she sent a "peace letter" concerning the plight of children displaced by the war. According to Mrs. Trump, Putin responded in writing, and the reunifications were facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine. This development is part of her ongoing "BE BEST" initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World football's governing body, FIFA, is reviewing its regulations with the potential aim of banning domestic league games from being staged in foreign countries. The organization is seeking legal advice as it redrafts rules that have not been updated since 2014, a time when hosting league matches overseas was not a significant issue. This move comes as leagues like Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A have scheduled games in the United States and Australia, respectively. FIFA President Gianni Infantino has expressed concerns that allowing a global free-for-all for domestic matches poses a "big risk" to the sport's structure.</p>

          <p>The Chinese central government has issued new guidelines for local authorities on the implementation of artificial intelligence, explicitly warning them not to grant AI systems access to sensitive data or state secrets. The document encourages the use of AI for tasks such as answering public inquiries, identifying decaying infrastructure, and assisting with administrative paperwork to improve efficiency. However, it mandates that all AI models must undergo a complete safety evaluation before deployment. The move is part of a broader effort to streamline government operations while maintaining strict control over state information.</p>

          <p>As part of its "health silk road" initiative, China is increasing its investment in Africa's pharmaceutical sector to help address the continent's reliance on imported medicines. Chinese companies are set to build an insulin production plant in Nigeria and a facility in Ivory Coast to manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. Africa currently imports approximately 70% of its essential medicines, and these projects aim to fill critical manufacturing gaps. The investments are driven by high demand for generic medications and treatments for chronic illnesses across the continent.</p>

          <p>German lawmakers are debating a proposal to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as catcalling, which is currently not explicitly illegal under the country's sexual offenses legislation. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) is advocating for a new law to close what it sees as a legal loophole, arguing that such behavior intimidates victims and restricts their access to public spaces. Opponents question the practicality of new legislation, suggesting that existing insult laws could be reinterpreted or that education is a better solution. This debate follows similar legal changes in other European countries like Belgium, France, and Spain.</p>

The proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence" included terms such as capping international student admissions and restricting leaders' political comments.
