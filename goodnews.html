          <p>A trove of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was accidentally discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, which arrived from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941, contain Nazi propaganda and materials intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. The contents of the crates are being surveyed to determine what information they hold about the Holocaust and other aspects of the Nazi regime, such as the global Nazi money trail. The documents had remained unopened for decades, and their discovery has prompted investigations into why they were not examined earlier.</p>

Authorities are also examining a vehicle fire on May 8 and a fire at the entrance of a property in Islington on May 11 for possible links to the incident. The investigation is ongoing, and police are keeping an open mind about any potential connections between the fires.</p>

Garber contends that the federal government is overreaching into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and disregarding Harvard's compliance with the law. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to Harvard and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status, prompting Garber to defend the university's actions and refute claims of partisanship.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority has reversed its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed earlier this year amid accusations that the broadcaster was inciting sedition. The authority, dominated by the Fatah party, has long been at odds with the Qatar-funded media company, accusing it of supporting Hamas. While the ban has been lifted, Al Jazeera's offices remain closed due to an Israeli military order. The decision comes as the Palestinian Authority faces criticism for stifling dissent and intimidating critics.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials, influencers and state-run media are casting the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the U.S. as a victory and a vindication of Beijing's negotiating strategy. They are arguing that their defiant public posture worked and was a major reason they were able to strike a deal with U.S. officials in Switzerland with relatively few concessions. In the eyes of the Chinese public, negotiators from Beijing appear to have convinced President Donald Trump's administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate that Trump imposed, and slash them to 30%.</p>
