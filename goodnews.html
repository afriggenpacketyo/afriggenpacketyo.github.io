          <p>Brazilian police arrested two suspects, reportedly Lady Gaga fans, who were allegedly plotting a bomb attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew over two million fans. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were allegedly planning to use improvised explosives, but no explosives were found during the operation, dubbed 'Operation Fake Monsters'. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the threat until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and had worked closely with law enforcement during the planning stages. The police operation involved search warrants in several cities, aiming to preempt any threat to the singer's performance.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the renowned value investor. Buffett transformed a failing textile company into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate by acquiring successful businesses and insurers, utilizing their cash flow for further investments. Known for his disciplined approach and long-term perspective, Buffett amassed a personal fortune of $168 billion and influenced countless financiers, though he acknowledged the role of luck in his success. His successor, Gregory Abel, is viewed as a capable operator, though some investors worry that Berkshire may lose its unique stock-picking focus without Buffett at the helm.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is seeking to incorporate its launch site in Cameron County, Texas, into its own city, Starbase, potentially transforming the area into a company town primarily for SpaceX employees. While a preliminary vote shows strong support, the move raises concerns among local residents about restricted access to Boca Chica Beach, environmental impacts, and rising costs of living. SpaceX is seeking permits for up to 25 launches per year, leading to disruptions and environmental concerns voiced by residents and environmental groups. The proposed municipality could gain control over the nearby beach and road, prompting concerns about public access guaranteed by the state's Open Beaches Act.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill allows most students attending accredited private schools to receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities may receive up to $30,000 per year. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by siphoning away funds to benefit wealthier students already in private education. Supporters, including President Trump, hail the bill as a victory for students and parents, ensuring educational freedom.</p>
