          <p>India's consumer price index (CPI) eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, primarily due to a decline in food prices. This marks the lowest level since February 2019, with food inflation dropping to 0.99% and vegetable inflation decreasing by 13.7%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy in response to these easing inflationary pressures, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%.

Republicans argue that the Clean Air Act was not intended to grant one state the power to control emissions standards for entire industries nationwide.

          <p>China's ruling Communist Party, via its top theoretical journal Qiushi, has praised Pop Mart, the company behind the viral Labubu toy, for its creative marketing and international success. The article highlights Labubu's global fan base as evidence of China's shift from a producer of low-value goods to a hub of innovation. It likens Labubu's popularity to other successful Chinese products, such as the video game Black Myth: Wukong and the animated film Ne Zha 2. The commentary emphasizes the importance of long-term innovation and the growing global recognition of Chinese creative products. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 07:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of Brazilian football fans suggests that the collective rituals surrounding a match, such as the arrival of the team bus and collective chanting, can be more emotionally intense than the game itself. The study, based on heart rate monitoring, highlights the importance of football as a collective ritual and a public theatre of identity. Sociologists argue that watching football elicits a diverse range of emotions and psychological states, and understanding these requires examining the cultural and historical context. In an increasingly individualized world, football's communitarian cultures offer a sense of belonging and authenticity. </p>

The new format, championed by FIFA President Gianni Infantino, seeks to generate increased revenue and will be held every four years.

While participating clubs are pleased with the financial rewards, critics point to the already overcrowded football calendar and the potential for player fatigue and injuries. </p>

Speaking at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, Huang emphasized Nvidia's role in the development of driverless vehicles, as the company provides both hardware and software solutions for AVs. Self-driving cars are becoming increasingly common in the U.S., with companies like Waymo operating robotaxi services in various cities.
