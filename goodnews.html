        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a decrease in overall electric vehicle exports from China to the UK, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports have seen a substantial increase, nearly 600% in the first quarter of this year. This trend indicates a growing preference for hybrid EVs among British consumers, who are attracted by more affordable Chinese car brands compared to European marques like Tesla. The UK's lower import tariff on Chinese EVs, compared to the EU, makes it a key export destination for Chinese manufacturers. The article highlights the shift in consumer choices amid rising expenses and the increasing competitiveness of Chinese automotive technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, attributed to reduced crude prices and production volumes, although the $26 billion income marginally surpassed analyst predictions. The company's free cash flow also fell, reflecting continuing financial pressures amid global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty impacting energy markets. Despite a cut in performance-linked dividend payouts, the company increased its base dividend by 4.2%, emphasizing its resilience and long-term strategic view. The article notes that the dividend reduction, while easing pressure on Aramco, may affect Saudi government revenues amid costly megaprojects and OPEC+ production cuts.</p>

Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. The article notes that elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster spring home-buying season.</p>
