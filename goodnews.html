Ochmann plays C√©sar, a television producer navigating life with two teenage daughters and twins after the death of his wife. The series explores themes of family reconnection and the challenges of parenting, with comedic situations arising from C√©sar's attempts to manage his chaotic household like a demanding television program.

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion, with two competing amendments tabled by Labour MPs Tonia Antoniazzi and Stella Creasy. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but permits it under certain conditions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, with approval from two doctors. Antoniazzi's amendment seeks to prevent investigations, arrests, and imprisonment for women who terminate their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children has criticized the amendment, calling it an "extreme and dangerous proposal." The vote will address the legal status of abortion and its potential impact on women's healthcare access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focused on the global arms export market, driven by security concerns and the need to deepen ties with allies. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani has expressed his desire to promote Japan's defense exports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended the country's largest defense exhibition. Experts suggest Japan's motivations are more related to security than profiting from global arms demand. The move aims to improve interoperability with allies, develop Japan's defense industrial base, and achieve economies of scale. Despite increasing its defense budget, Japan has largely purchased weapons from the U.S., leading to a decline in its domestic defense industry.</p>
