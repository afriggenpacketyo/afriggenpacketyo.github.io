        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations General Assembly has passed a resolution supporting a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine that explicitly excludes Hamas from future governance. The declaration, backed by France and Saudi Arabia, demands Hamas release all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and transfer its weapons to the Palestinian Authority. This move, which passed with 142 votes in favor, is seen as a significant diplomatic step that directly condemns Hamas while laying groundwork for a sovereign Palestinian state. The vote precedes a summit where several nations are expected to formally recognize Palestine, increasing pressure on Israel.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to support Ukrainians injured during the war with Russia. Invited by the Superhumans organization, which provides prosthetics and rehabilitation, he emphasized his desire to help the recovery process for military personnel and civilians. The visit coincides with a new UK aid package for Ukraine and highlights his ongoing commitment through the Invictus Games Foundation. This trip marks his first to the Ukrainian capital and serves as a high-profile gesture of solidarity with the nation's efforts to cope with the devastating human cost of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Major technology companies including Apple, Google, and Meta are advancing generative AI to create real-time language translation devices, bringing a long-held science fiction concept closer to reality. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods, while Google's Pixel phones offer a similar capability that preserves a speaker's voice inflections. This emerging technology could revolutionize communication for travelers and in professional settings like hospitals and schools. The development marks a new competitive frontier for AI, potentially reshaping industries and overcoming global language barriers.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is having a noticeable impact on the apparel industry, particularly in the resale market. Consignment stores report a surge in donations of larger-sized clothing and a corresponding increase in demand for smaller sizes. While major retailers have not officially announced changes, some brands catering to big and tall customers are observing a shift in demand toward the lower end of their plus-size ranges. This trend signals a potential long-term resizing of the American consumer base, posing both challenges and opportunities for clothing manufacturers.</p>

          <p>A British-Belarusian dual national, Julia Fenner, has been released from prison in Belarus as part of a larger deal negotiated between the U.S. and Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. In total, 52 political prisoners, including activists and journalists, were freed in exchange for the U.S. easing some sanctions on Belarus's national airline. While the UK government welcomed the release of its citizen, exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya noted that over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated. The deal represents a rare moment of diplomatic engagement with the authoritarian regime.</p>

          <p>Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has confirmed that Altay Bayindir will keep his position as the starting goalkeeper for the upcoming derby match against Manchester City. This decision comes despite some recent mistakes and the club's deadline-day signing of 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp. While Amorim stated that Bayindir will continue for now, he also praised Lammens as having the potential to be the team's first choice for years to come. The move follows the loan departure of former number one André Onana, creating a period of transition for the key defensive position.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center is tracking a tropical wave off the coast of Africa that has a 40% chance of developing into a tropical depression by the middle of next week. The system is moving westward across the Atlantic, and environmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development. This potential storm activity comes just after the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which has been relatively quiet so far this year. Forecasters warn that activity is likely to increase in late September and urge residents in coastal areas to remain prepared.</p>

          <p>The investment arms of wealthy families are increasingly collaborating through multifamily offices to invest in commercial real estate. This model allows them to pool capital and expertise to access larger and more diverse deals than they could individually. According to Travis King, CEO of investment platform Realm, this strategy helps families diversify their portfolios and gain the benefits of direct real estate ownership without intensive management requirements. While institutional investors have long had significant real estate allocations, family offices are now catching up, with a focus on opportunities in sectors like office space.

          <p>For individuals in their 70s with around $500,000 in savings, financial planning should shift from aggressive growth to risk minimization and ensuring long-term stability. Key steps include conducting a full financial review to understand monthly needs, consolidating accounts to simplify management, and potentially working with a fee-only fiduciary planner. Instead of aiming for rapid growth, the focus should be on creating a sustainable income stream from existing assets. A conservatively invested portfolio of this size could reasonably supplement income for many years, making retirement achievable with careful planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four decades after the original, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" reunites the fictional heavy-metal band for one last show, exploring themes of obsolescence and nostalgia. The film finds the band members in absurd post-rock careers before they are brought back together by the death of their former manager. While the sequel may not have the groundbreaking impact of the 1984 classic, it retains the vital deadpan comedy of its main characters. The movie serves as an in-joke for an era where rock and roll itself often feels like a legacy act, complete with cameos from real-life music legends.</p>

          <p>The animated film "KPop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-watched movie ever by cleverly exploring the dynamics of modern fandom. The story centers on a K-pop girl group whose demon-hunting powers are fueled directly by the adoration of their fans, literally transforming fandom into a force for good. The movie contrasts this with a rival boy band of demons who feed on obsessive worship for destructive purposes. Filled with catchy music and inside jokes for K-pop enthusiasts, the film celebrates the positive, creative energy of fan communities while also acknowledging the potentially parasitic nature of the artist-fan relationship.</p>
