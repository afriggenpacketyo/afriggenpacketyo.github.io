          <p>The UK is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade agreement with the U.S., potentially making it the first country to do so under the Trump administration's new trade policies. While specifics remain unclear, the agreement is expected to involve lowering British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm products, as well as reducing taxes on U.S. technology companies. Negotiations are ongoing, with the UK aiming to secure tariff relief on key sectors before engaging in formal talks with the EU for a separate European agreement. The New York Times reports this agreement could be a starting point for future negotiations.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie, the deceased British novelist, has been reanimated using AI to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro. The course utilizes a "digital prosthetic" created with AI and a script based on her writings and archival interviews. While Christie's family supports the project, some critics raise ethical concerns about using AI to represent deceased individuals, even with consent, as it involves creating new content in their likeness without their direct input or approval.</p>

The challenge lies in creating a managed capitalism that addresses these issues while maintaining prosperity and avoiding the pitfalls of both socialism and fascism.</p>
