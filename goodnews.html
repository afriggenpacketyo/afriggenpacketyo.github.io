          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer criticized Friday's market activity, where Big Tech stocks underperformed despite a wider rally fueled by expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. He urged investors not to sell these major tech companies, particularly ahead of Nvidia's anticipated strong earnings report this week, which is expected to show continued demand for its AI offerings. Cramer highlighted Palo Alto Networks as a buying opportunity, viewing its recent dip as unwarranted given its robust performance and strategic acquisition of CyberArk. He anticipates long-term growth for the cybersecurity firm, reinforcing his confidence in its market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a widespread "blind box" craze, where consumers purchase mystery items without knowing the exact variety inside until unwrapped, driving significant profits for companies like Pop Mart with its Labubu collectible toys. This phenomenon, which encourages repeat purchases to complete sets or find rare editions, gained popularity during the pandemic as a budget-friendly pick-me-up for young Chinese consumers amidst economic uncertainty and lockdowns. The trend extends beyond toys to various sectors, including travel and supermarkets. However, the Chinese government has issued warnings against "irrational consumption" and "addiction," especially among minors, identifying it as a potential "commercial trap" that exploits psychological vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has launched its new robotics chip module, the Jetson AGX Thor, available as a developer kit for $3,499, signaling a strategic focus on robotics as a major growth opportunity beyond its core AI business. This advanced "robot brain" is powered by Nvidia's Blackwell graphics processor technology, offering 7.5 times faster performance than previous generations, crucial for running complex generative AI and visual models essential for humanoid robots. With companies like Agility Robotics, Amazon, and Meta already leveraging Jetson chips, Nvidia aims to enable the entire robotics industry with its infrastructure and software. While robotics currently contributes a small fraction of Nvidia's revenue, its rapid growth, evidenced by a 72% increase in the automotive and robotics division's quarterly sales, highlights its burgeoning market potential.</p>

          <p>Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary revealed he was part of a three-person syndicate that acquired the record-breaking Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan signed sports card for nearly $13 million at auction. This monumental sale surpassed the previous record for the most expensive trading card ever sold. O'Leary explained that the group formed a syndicate to avoid competing bids, viewing the card as a significant investment asset akin to Bitcoin or gold, and believes it will remain off the market for decades. He emphasized the increasing "institutional" nature of sports collectibles, asserting their potential for appreciation regardless of economic downturns, and added this prestigious card to his expanding collection.

In contrast, the stock market is generally preferred for long-term wealth accumulation due to its potential for significantly higher returns, despite its inherent volatility and risk of capital loss. Additionally, experts suggest Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as a viable option for intermediate-term goals, allowing individuals to lock in current rates for guaranteed returns without exposure to stock market fluctuations.

          <h2>Guardiola's Manchester City Rebuild Shows Early Missteps and Defensive Vulnerabilities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City's recent performances, including a 4-3 defeat in the Club World Cup and a 2-0 loss to Tottenham, indicate that Pep Guardiola's team rebuild is still a work in progress, marked by early missteps and defensive vulnerabilities. Despite a strong opening league win against Wolves, the article highlights a recurring openness at the back, particularly susceptible to direct balls behind the high defensive line, and concerning individual errors from new goalkeeper James Trafford. The potential departure of long-standing goalkeeper Ederson and the reported pursuit of Gianluigi Donnarumma, whose passing style differs significantly, raise questions about Guardiola's strategic direction and whether it signals a shift away from a more direct approach. These results suggest City needs to demonstrate more consistent form to reaffirm its dominance.</p>

          <p>An unpiloted SpaceX Cargo Dragon successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS) early Monday, delivering over 5,000 pounds of essential equipment and supplies, including 1,500 tortillas, a crumb-free bread substitute for astronauts. Crucially, this mission also included an add-on thruster kit in its trunk section, designed to help boost the space station's altitude and counteract the effects of atmospheric drag. This new capability will allow Dragon to contribute to maintaining the ISS's orbit, supplementing the re-boost operations typically handled by Russian Progress cargo ships. The problem-free rendezvous and docking underscore the increasing reliability of commercial resupply missions and the vital ongoing international collaboration necessary for maintaining the orbiting laboratory's operations and longevity.</p>

The chipmaker's revenue has more than tripled and profits quadrupled, making it a $4 trillion market cap company. While growth remains substantial, it has slowed from triple-digit expansion to an anticipated 53% year-over-year increase, with data center revenue, primarily from major internet companies, comprising 88% of sales. The performance of Nvidia's Blackwell line of GPUs and systems will be crucial, affirming its technological lead and market foothold. The company is also navigating challenges in the Chinese market due to U.S. export licenses and a new deal with President Trump involving revenue sharing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) announced an $18 billion acquisition of Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, a move aimed at boosting KDP's struggling coffee business. The deal, which caused KDP's stock to fall 8% while JDE Peet's shares climbed 17%, is expected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years. Following the acquisition, KDP intends to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic division aims to create two sharply focused entities with distinct growth propositions, with the coffee business projected to achieve $16 billion in annual sales and the beverage firm $11 billion.

He asserted that such moves, which combine CHIPS Act grant funding with other government allocations, would make the U.S. "RICHER, AND RICHER" by creating more jobs. White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett clarified that this is part of a broader strategy to establish a sovereign wealth fund, akin to those in smaller, resource-rich countries. While unusual for the U.S. to take large corporate positions, Hassett cited historical precedents like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, emphasizing that the government would not interfere in company operations but aims to encourage onshore production.

          <p>Mortgage experts anticipate that this fall could present a significant refinancing opportunity for homeowners, particularly those with existing rates above 7%. Mortgage rates have recently dropped to around 6.5% for 30-year fixed loans, reaching their lowest levels since last October, with further reductions expected if the Federal Reserve implements its predicted rate cuts. Homeowners with large loan balances or FHA loans are poised to benefit most, as even modest rate reductions can translate into thousands of dollars in annual savings. Experts strongly advise potential refinancers to prepare by proactively checking credit reports, thoroughly reviewing their financial positions, and gathering all necessary documentation to capitalize quickly when favorable rates emerge in the market.

This increasingly early August release date, which has gradually shifted forward over the years, is a strategic move for Starbucks, particularly as the company aims to boost sales and in-store traffic, which experienced a 2% decline in the last quarter. New menu additions like Pecan Cold Foam are also expected to attract customers, leveraging the significant popularity and year-over-year growth of cold foam add-ons.</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are comparing Roth 401(k) and Roth IRA contributions as powerful tools for tax-free retirement growth, emphasizing the trade-off between "power versus freedom" in financial planning. While both accounts offer tax-free withdrawals in retirement and no required distributions for the original owner, Roth 401(k)s typically include employer matches, offering "free money," along with significantly higher contribution limits and no income restrictions. Conversely, Roth IRAs provide greater flexibility, allowing penalty-free withdrawals of contributions anytime. Experts generally advise contributing at least enough to receive an employer match in a Roth 401(k) before considering Roth IRA contributions, also noting that higher earners can bypass Roth IRA income limits through a "backdoor Roth" strategy for increased savings potential.
