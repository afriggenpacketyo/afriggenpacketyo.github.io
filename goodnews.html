          <p>Famed New York restaurateur Keith McNally opens up about his life in his new memoir, "I Regret Almost Everything," detailing his difficult recovery from a 2016 stroke that led to a suicide attempt. He discusses overcoming his embarrassment about his condition by using social media, which also led to public controversies, such as his criticism of James Corden. McNally reflects on his working-class London upbringing and his journey to becoming a celebrated figure in the NYC restaurant scene. He now emphasizes the importance of kindness, something he came to appreciate more from his staff post-stroke.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During the WNBA All-Star Game warm-ups, players wore T-shirts with the message "Pay Us What You Owe Us" to highlight their demands in contentious Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) negotiations. The players argue that the league's booming business, including a new $2.2 billion media rights deal and high expansion fees, should translate to increased salaries. Despite the public pressure, WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert expressed optimism that a "transformational" deal could be reached before the current CBA expires on October 31. The protest has drawn mixed reactions on social media.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests Personality Traits Can Be Intentionally Changed Through Behavioral Intervention</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 09:13:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of a fixed personality is being challenged by new scientific research, as detailed by writer Olga Khazan in her book "Me, But Better." After struggling with anxiety and neuroticism, Khazan embarked on a year-long journey to consciously alter her personality by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations, such as taking an improv class. University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala supports this, explaining that intentional changes in thinking and behavior, maintained over time, can shift ingrained traits. This approach suggests that people can actively work to develop the personality they desire.</p>

          <p>Jaclyn Johnson, founder of the events and media company Create & Cultivate, reveals what she looks for when hiring for her remote team. She states the biggest red flag is a candidate who is unprepared and lacks knowledge about the company or the specific role. Conversely, Johnson is most impressed by candidates who have done their research and can offer genuine, constructive feedback on the business's current operations, such as its marketing strategies. She also values problem-solvers who can adapt quickly and are open about past mistakes, seeing these as green flags for a startup environment.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, recounts her trailblazing career and the challenges she faced, including racism and sexism. She shares an anecdote about Senator Jesse Helms singing "Dixie" to intimidate her, an experience she met with a calm retort. Moseley Braun argues that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism in the U.S. and expresses concern that the Democratic party is not effectively countering Donald Trump. Despite current political setbacks, she remains optimistic about the public's commitment to democracy.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships emphasizes that teaching "self-connection" is the single most important skill for a child's success. This involves helping children tune into and trust their own emotions, needs, and inner voice. The article warns that common parental responses, like dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them not to trust their feelings, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. The author provides practical advice, such as validating emotions and modeling self-awareness, to help parents foster this non-negotiable skill for building resilience and authentic confidence.</p>

          <p>A 300-year-old mystery may be closer to being solved, as archaeologists believe they have identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as La Buse, in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables, estimated to be worth over $100 million today. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout. While the discovery is significant, the bulk of La Buse's legendary treasure, supposedly hidden with a cryptic map, remains unfound.</p>

          <p>Despite recent struggles in its primary smartphone chipset business and concerns over losing Apple as a customer, Qualcomm's diversification efforts present a potential opportunity for investors. The company is expanding into the Internet of Things (IoT), automotive, and PC sectors, which are showing significant growth, with IoT and automotive revenues surging 31% and 60% respectively in the first half of fiscal 2025. This growth in emerging areas, combined with a relatively low P/E ratio, suggests the market may be undervaluing the company's future potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a court ruling that found it subject to Georgia's open records law, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released hundreds of pages of documents related to the controversial "Cop City" training center. The lawsuit, brought by a news outlet and a research group, sets a major precedent for the transparency of police foundations nationwide. The released records reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to prevent a public referendum on the project, warning it would derail financing and damage the city council's credibility. This outcome is seen as a significant victory for public accountability.</p>

          <p>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common and difficult-to-treat hormonal disorder, are finding symptom relief from GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. Patients report improvements in issues like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management, which are often linked to the insulin resistance common in PCOS. While the drugs are not officially approved for this use, small studies and anecdotal evidence suggest they can be highly effective by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn helps regulate hormones. However, the high cost and lack of insurance coverage remain significant barriers for many patients.</p>

          <p>A tsunami threat for Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has been canceled following a series of five strong earthquakes that struck in the nearby sea. The largest quake registered a magnitude of 7.4 at a shallow depth, prompting initial warnings for the Russian coast and a tsunami watch for Hawaii, which was also later lifted. The quakes were centered east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city with a population of 180,000. Despite the power of the tremors and the initial danger, there have been no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the seismic activity.</p>

The brothers planned a secretive adventure into the unexplored regions of China with the ambitious goal of finding a giant panda. At the time, the black-and-white bear was a legendary creature, so rare that many doubted its existence, and it was the only large mammal yet to be acquired for a museum collection. The passage captures the spirit of an era of discovery, where parts of the world remained unmapped.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Superman's Origins as a Leftist, Immigrant "Champion of the Oppressed"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to recent conservative criticism, Superman's origins are deeply rooted in leftist and immigrant experiences, according to comic book author Grant Morrison. Created by the sons of Jewish immigrants, the character's first appearances in the 1930s portrayed him as a "socialist figure" who fought corrupt bosses and tore down slums to force the construction of better housing. This analysis traces Superman's evolution from this activist beginning to a patriotic figure in the 1940s and a suburban father-figure in the 1950s. The character's enduring power lies in his ability to be a timeless metaphor for humanity's best qualities.</p>
