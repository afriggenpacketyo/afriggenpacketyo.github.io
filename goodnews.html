          <p>The robotic Soviet spacecraft Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, it has been adrift in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact location is still unknown. Although some parts of the spacecraft are expected to survive the atmospheric plunge, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, and if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., ostensibly to discuss city priorities like infrastructure, hours before documents related to Adams's previously dropped federal corruption case were released. Trump suggested Adams came to thank him for his support during the case, while Adams initially focused on discussing a wind farm project. Documents released by prosecutors revealed an investigation into witness tampering, though Adams was never charged. The meeting occurred amid ongoing tensions between the city and the Trump administration, including disputes over immigration and law enforcement cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled a potential reduction in tariffs on China, stating that an '80% Tariff on China seems right!' ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators. The conciliatory tone follows Trump's announcement of tariffs up to 145% on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliation from China. Investors are hoping for a resolution to the trade war, which has caused market volatility, with analysts suggesting tariffs could be cut to 50%-60%.</p>

Sessions III, said Ms. Ozturk should be freed immediately: ‚ÄúHer continued detention cannot stand.‚Äù Her lawyer, Mahsa Khanbabai, said she was ‚Äúrelieved and ecstatic‚Äù that Ms. Ozturk had been released.</p>
