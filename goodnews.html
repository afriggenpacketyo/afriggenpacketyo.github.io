          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli troops within Gaza during the ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough, as diplomatic efforts intensify to resolve the 21-month war.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that could significantly alter the real estate market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from taxation, a limit unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by incentivizing older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home prices. The proposal aims to address the current housing shortage and affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has released the framework for a new trade agreement with Indonesia that would see Jakarta eliminate most tariffs on American imports. Under the proposed deal, U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods would be set at 19%, a significant reduction from the initial 32% duty proposed under President Trump's tariff plan. The framework also includes forthcoming commercial deals valued in the billions for aircraft and energy products. Final negotiations are underway to formalize the agreement, which aims to create more balanced and reciprocal trade between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump met privately with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos at the White House last week for over an hour, according to sources familiar with the matter. The meeting signals a significant warming of relations between the two, who were frequently at odds during Trump's first term, largely due to Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post. Recently, Bezos has reportedly sought to strengthen his ties with the administration, a move that comes as his relationship with rival billionaire Elon Musk has soured. The discussions reportedly centered in part on government contracts for Bezos's companies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to name Gita O’Neill, a career attorney from the L.A. city attorney’s office, as its new interim chief executive. O'Neill will guide the agency through a significant downsizing over the next year, as Los Angeles County establishes a new homelessness department that will assume many of LAHSA's responsibilities and a large portion of its budget. The leadership change comes after a period of intense criticism of LAHSA for poor contract management and financial oversight, as the region continues to grapple with its homelessness crisis.</p>

          <p>A recently passed bill signed by President Trump has established a new student loan repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), set to become available by July 2026. This new income-driven plan will calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, with payments ranging from 1% to 10% of earnings and a minimum of $10 per month. As the legislation phases out several existing repayment options, RAP may become the primary affordable choice for new borrowers, offering loan forgiveness after a 30-year period.

          <p>Venture capital investment in U.S. artificial intelligence startups surged to $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Major players like OpenAI and Anthropic continue to raise massive funding rounds, driving nearly two-thirds of all venture capital into the AI sector. However, the exit market tells a different story, with only $36 billion in total value from acquisitions and IPOs during the same period. This indicates a trend where far more money is being invested into AI companies than is being returned to investors. (not investment advice)</p>
