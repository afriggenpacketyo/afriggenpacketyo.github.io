        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A by-election is taking place in Hamilton, Larkhall, and Stonehouse following the death of Christina McKelvie, an SNP member. The election serves as a significant test of voter sentiment in Scotland since the UK general election, and it gauges Reform UK's potential impact. While billboard advertising suggests a race between the SNP and Reform UK, Labour is also a strong contender. Voters express frustration with politicians, citing rising household bills and healthcare access as key issues. Reform UK is capitalizing on public discontent, focusing on immigration and tax policies, leading to accusations of racism. The outcome will be closely watched for insights into voter behavior ahead of the next Holyrood election, and the result is anticipated to influence the political narrative in Scotland.</p>

The arts play an essential role in shaping environmental governance, fostering care and agency that has been externalized to experts.

Artists are intervening directly in ecological infrastructure, creating forms of civic reparation.

          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after years on the political sidelines. However, the party faces an existential threat from a mass-recall campaign engineered by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which could jeopardize its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failure to contain the recall challenge could derail the KMT‚Äôs leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has signaled his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a promising successor, as the KMT navigates internal politics and external challenges.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This behavior reassures swing voters that any extreme actions are provisional, and that he is generally willing to pull back. Trump's recent moves, such as softening his stance on China tariffs and casting himself as a peacemaker, have helped his poll numbers recover. Voters appreciate seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others, as they expect him to pressure institutions they distrust while accepting counterpressure and retreats.</p>

          <h2>UK Bans Disposable Vapes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 19:12:11 EDT</div>

          <p>The ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes comes into force on Sunday across the UK, aiming to protect children's health and the environment. Shops and supermarkets will no longer be able to stock them, though rechargeable or refillable devices can still be sold. Disposable vapes have been cited as a key driver in the rise in youth vaping, and ministers predict the ban will have a significant impact. Retailers in England and Wales breaching the ban face fines, and while vaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, long-term risks are still unknown.</p>

          <h2>Patti LuPone Apologizes for Comments on Kecia Lewis, Audra McDonald</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 19:08:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Patti LuPone issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers criticized her for "inappropriate and unacceptable public comments," specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis. The apology followed an open letter from over 500 Broadway performers, prompted by LuPone's remarks in a New Yorker interview. The controversy began when LuPone made disparaging comments about Lewis's video addressing noise complaints during their shows' runs. LuPone expressed regret for her "flippant and emotional responses" and committed to making amends, with McDonald stating that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.</p>
