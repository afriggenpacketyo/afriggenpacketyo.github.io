          <p>As the U.S. under President Donald Trump scales back clean energy investments and labels wind and solar power a 'scam,' Chinese 'cleantech' firms are rapidly expanding into emerging markets across Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Latin America. Chinese investors are showing renewed interest in companies like Malaysia's Mabill Technologies, deepening their influence by integrating proprietary technologies into local supply chains. Through 'tech diplomacy' and Belt and Road-funded infrastructure, China is positioning itself as a clean energy hub, promoting its technical standards in solar, batteries, and electric vehicles.

          <p>New Jersey's Meadowlands, once infamous as a dumping ground, have undergone a remarkable transformation into a thriving salt marsh supporting over 300 bird species and 50 fish species. This 'Lazarus-like' resurrection, driven by state and federal policies since the 1970s, balances waste disposal, development, and environmental protection. However, the Supreme Court's 2023 ruling in Sackett v. EPA, which restricted the Clean Water Act's reach, and the Trump administration's implementation, threaten these protections, potentially jeopardizing millions of acres of wetlands. The article highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain this delicate ecological balance against development pressures and policy changes. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant study by the charity GiveDirectly found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to over 10,500 households in rural Kenya led to a 48% reduction in infant and child mortality. The article explores potential mechanisms, including increased hospital deliveries and improved food security, though definitive causes remain unclear. While the impact on lives saved is substantial, the cost-effectiveness of the program for mortality reduction ($299,418 per life saved) is not competitive with other health interventions in developing countries. The research suggests cash grants primarily reduce poverty, emphasizing the need for complementary health infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>
