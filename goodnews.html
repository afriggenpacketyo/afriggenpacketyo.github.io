        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is renaming its digital entertainment division as Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, using the Chinese name for the orca, or killer whale, as part of a strategy to revitalize growth outside its core e-commerce and cloud businesses. The company says that orcas are large, flexible, and smart, and can adapt to complex environments, characteristics consistent with the group's concept of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness. The rebranding adds to Alibaba's "zoo" of animal-themed businesses and aligns with its strategy to return to its original mission and start a new business. Two years ago, Alibaba announced a restructuring that split the company into six business groups. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price jumped to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The cryptocurrency has benefited from liquidity in the stock market, recent risk-off scenarios, and increased inflows into exchange-traded funds. On-chain data indicates less selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market, with investors anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further drive prices higher. The Senate voted to advance legislation creating the first regulatory framework in the U.S. for stablecoins, and Coinbase joined the S&P 500. Optimism score is 80 (not investment advice).</p>
