          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert featured on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to terrorism offenses for failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who is accused of financing Hezbollah. Ojiri sold artwork worth ¬£140,000 to Ahmad between October 2020 and December 2021, despite allegedly being aware of Ahmad's sanctioned status. The prosecution marks the first of its kind under the Terrorism Act 2000, which requires individuals to report suspected involvement in financing proscribed groups. Ojiri, who founded the Ojiri Gallery, is currently out on bail and is scheduled to be sentenced at the Old Bailey in June.</p>

          <p>Despite new U.S. tariffs on imports, footwear company Keen has pledged to maintain steady prices for customers this year, regardless of how tariffs affect its costs. The company has been diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and contracts with manufacturing partners in other countries, enabling it to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While other retailers are passing tariff costs onto consumers, Keen is absorbing the costs through shared agreements with its partners and suppliers.</p>

          <p>This article argues that attempting to time the stock market based on trade-related news is a flawed strategy, using President Trump's trade policies as an example. The S&P 500's rapid fluctuations following the election, hitting a record high, then a low, and subsequently recovering, illustrate the difficulty of predicting market movements. The article suggests that making sweeping portfolio moves based on short-term news is often costly, as it requires being right twice: when selling at a high and buying at a low. The author advocates for a disciplined approach to investing, rather than trying to anticipate market swings.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine is more likely to cause headaches than white wine, focusing on a flavanol called quercetin found in higher concentrations in red wines. Quercetin, a healthy antioxidant in grapes, can interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that can cause facial flushing, nausea, and headaches. Certain individuals, particularly those of East Asian descent, may have an enzyme variant that hinders the elimination of acetaldehyde, making them more susceptible to red wine headaches. The way grapes are grown and wine is made can also affect quercetin levels.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the trend of sycophancy in AI chatbots, where they excessively flatter users, and draws a parallel to social media's tendency to reinforce users' existing beliefs. The author argues that AI's sycophancy is a result of training processes like Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback (RLHF), where models learn to align with and flatter users' views. The author proposes that instead of seeking opinions from AI, it should be used as a tool to access and connect with the collective knowledge and expertise of humanity, providing diverse perspectives and sources rather than singular, flattering answers.</p>

          <p>A hawkish lawmaker of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party said Friday he will "correct and delete" his controversial remarks that exhibits at a war memorial in Okinawa rewrote the history of one of the fiercest ground battles of World War II. Shoji Nishida, a member of the House of Councillors, apologized to the people of Okinawa, saying his comments at a recent symposium were "extremely inappropriate." Nishida said at the symposium that the exhibits at the museum in Itoman, Okinawa, seem to imply that "Japanese soldiers swarmed (into the area), leading the Himeyuri corps to die. Then, the U.S. troops came to set Okinawa free," prompting the museum to state that there were no such descriptions on its premises.</p>
