          <p>Shares of SK Hynix have reached a two-decade high following reports that its parent company, SK Group, is planning to construct South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Telecom and SK Broadband are expected to spearhead the initiative, with support from SK Hynix, a leading supplier of DRAM, a type of semiconductor memory used in PCs and servers. Counterpoint Research notes that SK Hynix's earnings outlook has improved due to rising DRAM prices, with Morgan Stanley revising its estimates upward, while Samsung's market cap has declined due to struggles capitalizing on AI-led demand. SK Hynix has become a leader in high bandwidth memory, supplying to clients such as Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace starting in April of next year, while maintaining its benchmark policy rate at 0.5%. The central bank will decrease its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with total purchases declining to approximately 2 trillion yen by early 2027. This decision reflects a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amidst economic uncertainties, especially with concerns about U.S. trade policies impacting Japan's export-oriented economy. Despite ending a decade of unorthodox easing, the BOJ remains vigilant about the potential impact of global trade policies on economic activity and prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it will slow the reduction of government bond purchases from April of next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5% amidst rising growth risks. The central bank will reduce its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by about 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, and then decrease the cuts to 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027, aiming for monthly purchases of approximately 2 trillion yen. This move aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets and support market stability, with the next interim assessment scheduled for the June 2026 monetary policy meeting. Following the decision, the Nikkei 225 experienced gains, and the yen strengthened against the dollar.</p>

          <p>Gold has surpassed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys in performance this year, with spot prices surging 30% amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical tensions. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal due to its independence from government liabilities, contrasting it with assets tied to specific economies. While the dollar index has weakened and yields on U.S. government bonds have decreased, gold's demand has been driven by instability, particularly in the Middle East, and doubts about the U.S. dollar and Treasury market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that directives from the Trump administration leading to the cancellation of several NIH research grants were unlawful, specifically those related to LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and DEI. The judge stated the cancellations violated federal law, constituting racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community, prompting the NIH to restore the terminated grants. HHS stands by its decision to end funding for research prioritizing ideological agendas, and is exploring legal options including an appeal, while plaintiffs like Dr. Brittany Charlton expressed relief that the harm caused to researchers and their communities was acknowledged.</p>
