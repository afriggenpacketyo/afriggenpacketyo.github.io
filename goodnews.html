          <p>China's industrial profits increased for the second consecutive month in April, despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. The growth in profits, particularly in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, signals resilience in the Chinese economy. While U.S. tariffs had initially increased significantly, recent agreements between Washington and Beijing have led to a reduction in these levies. However, some industries, like the automobile and apparel sectors, still face challenges due to price competition and shifting demand (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer, in response to rising inflation and hefty U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the economic impact of the U.S. tariffs, especially on the auto industry, and pledged support for small and medium-sized companies. The subsidies are projected to reduce household energy bills, though critics suggest the measures are aimed at boosting government support ahead of the House of Councillors election (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>King Charles III is preparing to deliver a significant speech in Canada's parliament, expected to offer support in the country's dispute with U.S. President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King to deliver the speech at the opening of parliament after his recent general election victory. The King's decision to come to parliament in Ottawa is seen as a symbolic show of support for Canada. The speech will likely convey a message of Canada's sovereignty.</p>
