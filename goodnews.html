While specific details about the oil reserves and tariff rates remain undisclosed, the agreement marks a significant diplomatic and economic development. The announcement was made shortly after the U.S. imposed new tariffs on Pakistan's regional rival, India. (not investment advice)</p>

The facility, part of the global "Stargate" initiative, will initially house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs and operate entirely on renewable energy. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data to be processed on European soil. The project represents a significant expansion of AI infrastructure and highlights the critical role of Nvidia's chips in powering advanced artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Malaysia's transport minister, Anthony Loke, has indicated that several Malaysian airlines, including AirAsia, are interested in China's C919 passenger jet. The growing interest is driven by a need to diversify aircraft procurement and address long delivery backlogs from established manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. China's state-owned COMAC is promoting the C919 as a more readily available and cost-effective alternative for narrowbody airliners. This development highlights China's increasing competitiveness in the global aviation market, particularly within Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of ancient jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India after facing significant pressure from the Indian government and Buddhist leaders. The "Piprahwa Gems," which were set to be auctioned in Hong Kong, were acquired by the Godrej Industries Group and will now be put on permanent public display in India. The planned sale had sparked a major ethical debate over the commodification of sacred religious artifacts. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated the return as a victory for the nation's cultural heritage.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg reaffirmed the company's commitment to heavy investment in AI, projecting spending of up to $72 billion this year.
