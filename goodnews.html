          <h2>Stress Expert Suggests Helping Others is an Effective Way to Manage Stress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 15:15:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A stress physiologist argues that the most effective method for managing stress is not inward-focused self-care but channeling stress energy outward to help others. Research indicates that stress is a social experience, releasing oxytocin which motivates connection, making solitary coping methods often ineffective. The article suggests a technique called "stress springboarding," where individuals use their stress as fuel for meaningful actions that benefit colleagues, friends, or the community. Brain imaging studies support this, showing that helping others activates reward centers and reduces activity in stress-related brain regions, offering both personal and professional benefits.</p>

White also defended his stance on free speech for fighters, stating he is a strong believer in protecting all forms of speech, including controversial or hateful expressions.

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back its popular Monopoly Game promotion for the first time in nearly ten years, running from October 6 to November 2. The sweepstakes, now featuring a digital component through the McDonald's app, allows customers to collect game pieces from select purchases for a chance to win prizes. Available rewards range from instant-win food items to major prizes like $1,000,000 cash, a 2026 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and various trips and gift cards. The promotion was halted for years following a major fraud scheme that was uncovered in the early 2000s.</p>

          <p>Europe has retained the Ryder Cup with a 15-13 victory over the United States at Bethpage Black, holding off a powerful final-day comeback from the American team. Luke Donald became the first European captain since 1987 to win back-to-back Ryder Cups, successfully leading his team to victory on foreign soil. Despite a commanding lead heading into the Sunday singles, Europe faced a tense finish as the U.S. mounted a significant rally. The event was also marked by controversy over the behavior of some American fans, which drew criticism from players and golf legends alike.</p>

          <p>Scientists are leveraging a new suite of technologies, including autonomous drones, rapid DNA sequencing, and artificial intelligence, to catalog life on Earth at an unprecedented scale. These tools are helping to identify millions of unknown species, often referred to as "dark taxa," which elude traditional observation methods. For example, drones can collect environmental DNA (eDNA) from the air, while AI algorithms can analyze thousands of images or sounds to detect new species of insects and other animals. This technological revolution is crucial for understanding and preserving biodiversity amid the growing climate crisis, which threatens countless species with extinction.</p>

          <p>Kieran Culkin and his wife, Jazz Charton, are expecting their third child, a development that fulfills a deal they made at the 75th Emmy Awards. During his acceptance speech for lead actor in January 2024, the "Succession" star publicly told his wife he wanted more children, reminding her she had said "maybe" if he won. Charton announced the pregnancy on Instagram with a humorous post, joking that seeing Keanu Reeves on Broadway resulted in her being nine months pregnant. The couple, married since 2013, already have two children, Kinsey Sioux and Wilder Wolf.</p>

          <p>DuPont has agreed to acquire Sinochem RO Memtech, a move designed to bolster its reverse osmosis manufacturing footprint in China and the wider Asia-Pacific region. The acquisition aligns with DuPont's strategic goal of growing its Healthcare and Water divisions, which are expected to see faster growth than its other end markets. This deal is part of a broader strategy to use cash proceeds from other business sales to pursue further acquisitions in these key areas. The company is also preparing for the November spin-off of its electronics business, named Qnity, which it believes will unlock significant shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called Instant Checkout, allowing ChatGPT users to purchase products directly within the chatbot. The functionality initially supports single-item purchases from U.S. Etsy sellers, with over a million Shopify merchants, including major brands like Skims, to be added soon. This move could create a significant new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will take a transaction fee from each sale. The feature is powered by a new framework built in partnership with Stripe, aiming to streamline the user journey from conversation and product discovery to final purchase without leaving the chat interface.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While often associated with those already in retirement, purchasing an annuity at age 55 is both possible and potentially advantageous for long-term financial planning. At this age, individuals can opt for a deferred annuity, allowing the investment to grow tax-deferred for years before they need the income stream. This longer time horizon can lead to more favorable terms from insurers. However, the article cautions that annuities are illiquid investments with surrender periods, so buyers must be confident they won't need the funds for unexpected expenses before the penalty-free withdrawal period begins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, with the average 30-year rate now at 6.30%, significantly down from over 7% at the start of the year. This creates a more affordable climate for potential homebuyers who have been waiting for better conditions. However, the market remains volatile, and these low rates are not guaranteed to last, as factors like inflation and Treasury yields could cause them to rise again. With the Federal Reserve likely to cut rates again at the end of October, prospective buyers should weigh the benefits of acting now against the challenges of a less active fall housing market.

These safeguards will block sexual content and, in cases of acute distress, may involve alerting law enforcement.

This move comes amid heightened scrutiny from regulators like the FTC and follows a lawsuit from the parents of a teen who died by suicide, which they allege was influenced by the chatbot.</p>

She explains that these formative experiences of poverty and anxiety have deeply influenced her personal style of comedy, which often explores themes of class and politics. Alonzo notes that recent ICE raids have brought back the childhood fear she felt trying to protect her mother.</p>
