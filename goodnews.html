          <p>Kim Kardashian testified in a Paris court concerning the 2016 armed robbery where $10 million in jewelry was stolen. Kardashian recounted being bound and gagged at gunpoint during Paris Fashion Week, detailing the trauma she experienced when masked men broke into her residence. Her friend Simone Harouche testified earlier, recalling Kardashian's pleas for her life during the incident. The trial involves ten individuals accused of robbery and kidnapping, with some admitting involvement and expressing regret, while Kardashian's lawyers emphasize her respect for the French judicial system and her desire for an orderly trial, and the defense worries about the impact of her celebrity on the case. </p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper defended Prime Minister Keir Starmer's use of the phrase "island of strangers" in a speech outlining plans to cut immigration, rejecting accusations of divisive language. Starmer aimed to highlight the impact of rising migration and the need for integration, including English language tests. Cooper dismissed comparisons to Enoch Powell's rhetoric, emphasizing Starmer's acknowledgment of the UK's diverse strengths. Robert Jenrick, Conservative shadow justice secretary, supported Starmer's sentiment, while others, like Sadiq Khan, expressed discomfort with the phrasing. </p>

          <p>A 21-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire. The first fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, followed by a fire at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, north London. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the previous connections of the property with a high-profile public figure, and are treating the fires as suspicious. The car fire, which took place on the same street as the Kentish Town property, is also being investigated as part of the inquiry. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ever-changing tariff policies, shopping expert Trae Bodge recommends consumers look for sales events like Memorial Day, Father's Day, and Amazon Prime Day to secure discounted prices. She also advises checking the origin of products, as goods from Canada and Mexico might be subject to tariffs, but goods under the USMCA are exempt if primarily made in North America. Shoppers should consider purchasing domestic products to avoid price hikes on imported produce and prioritize planned purchases of big-ticket items like dishwashers or laptops before further price increases. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs, so consumers should be strategic rather than panic shopping. </p>

          <p>Toyota has unveiled a redesigned version of its U.S. electric vehicle, renaming it the "bZ" from "bZ4X" for the 2026 model year. The move aims to simplify the name and distance the updated model from its predecessor, which received poor reviews and faced a recall due to wheel detachment issues. The 2026 bZ will feature a 25% increase in EV range, up to a 50% improvement in horsepower, and fast-charging capabilities, addressing previous concerns.

          <p>The article explores whether attending stadium concerts with massive crowds provides a fulfilling experience for fans, or if the inconveniences outweigh the benefits. Social media fuels the fear of missing out, driving Gen Z to spend impulsively on live events, despite the high costs and potential for lackluster views or chaotic VIP sections. Stadium tours are lucrative for artists and offer a sense of community, but often lack optimal acoustics and can be physically demanding. Complaints about obstructed views, crowd crushes, and high prices raise questions about the future of concertgoing and whether the stadium tour bubble will burst. </p>

SoftBank's finance chief acknowledged potential obstacles from other stakeholders but remains optimistic that the reorganization will proceed by the end of the year. The original plan to remove the non-profit's control drew criticism, including from Elon Musk, so the restructure is an attempt to balance investor interests with ethical concerns. </p>

Scientists calculated when white dwarf stars would eventually die out based on Hawking radiation, extending the concept to other celestial bodies. While the end of the universe is still far off, other recent findings suggest dark energy, which makes up nearly 70% of the universe, may be weakening, potentially leading to a "Big Crunch."

The author explores the role of personal passion in finding meaningful work and how moral ambition differs from effective altruism. It emphasizes that moral ambition should not dominate one's life, and it's important to maintain a grounded perspective and surround oneself with critical thinkers. </p>

          <p>Gold is making a comeback as buyers and bankers recoil from uncertainty caused by events like Covid, the Ukraine war, and Trump's trade wars. The price of gold has risen significantly, with regular people viewing it as a safe haven amidst shaky economics and distrust in banks. Central banks have also been buying gold to diversify assets, particularly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Costco is selling gold bars, indicating a broader interest in the metal as a stable asset. (not investment advice) </p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts China Tariffs Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 06:49:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reduced tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 percent to 30 percent for a limited time, prompting China to reciprocate with lower tariffs. This move comes as the administration's initial claims that China needed the U.S. more than the U.S. needed China proved to be untrue. The mutually beneficial trade relationship was disrupted by high tariffs, leading to price hikes and potential shortages, which weakened Trump's negotiating position. While the tariff cut is temporary, tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term. </p>
