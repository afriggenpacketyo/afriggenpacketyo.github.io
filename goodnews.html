          <p>Despite bullish sentiment and record highs in the US stock market, this article highlights several risks that could derail the rally. These include potential cracks in the artificial intelligence theme, the impact of the trade war, rising government debt, and a weakening labor market. While strategists remain optimistic due to simultaneous record highs in other developed equity markets, they acknowledge these concerns. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley anticipate further gains in 2026, driven by expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a shaky start by Clayton Kershaw, the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied to defeat the San Francisco Giants 13-7, overcoming their recent struggles in high-leverage situations.

          <p>This article examines the escalating tensions between Ethiopia and Egypt over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile River, which Egypt sees as a threat to its water supply. With the diplomatic row intensifying, China's strong ties with both nations have been noted, which positions it as a potential mediator. However, observers suggest that China is unlikely to intervene directly, despite its significant economic and political influence in the region.

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a bill to ban PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," in cookware and other household items. Senate Bill 682 targets cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging, and certain children's products due to health risks associated with PFAS exposure. While some chefs and industry groups oppose the ban, citing the safety of PTFE in cookware, environmental groups and lawmakers emphasize the need to reduce PFAS exposure. The bill now heads to Governor Newsom for his signature. </p>

The high cost of insurance is making Tesla ownership unaffordable for some drivers, despite the vehicles' appeal. While Tesla has been experiencing losses on its insurance program, other EV brands are offering competitive incentives and discounts to attract customers. This trend highlights the importance of affordable insurance in making EVs accessible to a wider range of consumers. </p>
