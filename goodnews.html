          <p>On the second day of his state visit to the U.K., President Donald Trump met with Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss pressing global issues, including the wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The visit combined high-level politics with royal pageantry, including a formal farewell from King Charles III at Windsor Castle and a state banquet attended by tech and business leaders. While the leaders focused on reinforcing the U.S.-U.K. special relationship, the visit was also marked by large-scale protests in central London against the president's policies. The discussions aimed to address ongoing international crises and reaffirm transatlantic alliances during a period of significant geopolitical instability.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to drop in premarket trading. While same-store sales grew, particularly at its flagship chains, the company's fine-dining segment showed some weakness. Despite the earnings miss, Darden raised its full-year sales growth forecast, buoyed by its recent acquisition of the Chuy's Tex Mex chain. The results indicate strong performance in its casual dining sector, which helps to offset challenges in other areas of its diverse restaurant portfolio.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted to hold its key interest rate steady at 4%, citing the need to manage persistent inflationary pressures. The 7-2 vote saw two members favor a rate cut, indicating a division on the future path of monetary policy. The central bank is balancing sticky inflation against a weak economic growth outlook and an uncertain jobs market, with a potential rate cut in November hanging in the balance. Additionally, the bank announced it would slow the pace of selling U.K. government bonds, a process known as quantitative tightening.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is undertaking a massive conservation effort to protect its unique, flightless birds like the kākāpō and takahē from invasive predators. The country aims to eliminate species like stoats and rats by 2050, deploying advanced technology to achieve this ambitious goal. These new tools include automated traps that use AI for species identification and genomic research to potentially develop methods, such as gene drives, to halt predator breeding.

          <p>Leonardo DiCaprio's new film, "One Battle After Another," directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, explores themes of societal polarization and extremism. The movie, which also stars Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, follows a paranoid ex-revolutionary forced to confront his past after his daughter goes missing. DiCaprio stated the film holds a mirror up to the divisive nature of contemporary culture, while del Toro highlighted its entertainment value and heart. The film, loosely inspired by a Thomas Pynchon novel, has been warmly received by critics, who have praised its timely themes and strong performances.</p>

          <p>Coinciding with President Trump's state visit, the U.K. government announced it has secured £150 billion in investment commitments from U.S. companies, expected to create over 7,600 jobs. The largest pledge comes from private equity firm Blackstone, with significant investments also announced by tech giants Microsoft and Google for data center expansions. The announcement is part of a broader U.K. strategy to deepen economic ties with the U.S. However, it comes amid challenges in other sectors, with some pharmaceutical firms halting U.K. investment plans, citing an unfavorable business environment.</p>

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration announced that foreign nationals made 15.89 million visa-free entries into the country between January and August 2025. These entries constituted about two-thirds of all international arrivals during the period, indicating a strong reliance on visa-free policies to reboot tourism. A significant portion of this growth is attributed to a new reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia, which came into effect in July. The data suggests a gradual but steady recovery in international travel to China, with Southeast Asian visitors leading the trend.</p>

          <p>This analysis of the U.S. Men's National Soccer Team argues against the recent wave of criticism, suggesting that coach Mauricio Pochettino's experimental approach is building necessary depth ahead of the World Cup. While results in friendly matches have been inconsistent, Pochettino has used the opportunity to introduce new players and tactics, fostering a more competitive and hungry team culture. The article posits that the team's ultimate success will depend more on player health and good fortune at tournament time than on pre-World Cup friendly outcomes, making a case for patience.</p>

          <p>In a recent Senate hearing, Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician who voted to confirm Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as HHS Secretary, appeared to express regret over his decision. He forcefully challenged a fellow Republican senator's claims against the fired CDC director and strongly defended the medical necessity of the Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns against skepticism. Cassidy's impassioned defense, rooted in his professional experience as a liver specialist, signals a significant break with the anti-vaccine rhetoric influencing the administration's health policy and an attempt to reassert scientific principles.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration canceling nearly half a billion dollars in federal funding, California officials and industry experts remain committed to the state's ambitious offshore wind energy plan. The state aims to generate 25 gigawatts from floating offshore wind by 2045, a key component of its carbon neutrality goals. California is now leveraging state funds, including money from a voter-approved climate bond, to push forward with necessary port upgrades and infrastructure development. The state's perseverance highlights the growing divide between federal and state-level climate and energy policies.</p>

          <p>The city of West Hollywood has expanded its ban on the retail sale of cats and dogs to include most other animals, such as rabbits, birds, fish, and reptiles. The ordinance, effective in May 2026, aims to combat the inhumane conditions of commercial breeding mills, from which many pet store animals originate. While animal welfare groups like the SPCA and PETA praised the move, the Pet Advocacy Network warned it could drive sales to an unregulated black market, potentially repeating issues seen after a statewide ban on retail dog sales.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's proposal to rename the Department of Defense to the Department of War, while concerning, provides a more accurate reflection of the nation's military activities. The author suggests the term "defense" has been used as a euphemism to justify continuous warfare and ballooning budgets since it was adopted in 1949. A "Department of War" would be more historically continuous with the original 1789 department and could foster a more transparent debate about the true cost and purpose of U.S. military power globally.</p>

          <p>A new event called "Phasmagorica," held at L.A.'s historic Heritage Square Museum, offers attendees an immersive séance experience designed as "art." Created by magician BC Smith, the event guides small groups through the history of American spiritualism before leaving them alone in a darkened tent to commune with spirits using tools like a pendulum and spirit board. Smith, a self-described "hopeful skeptic," aims to create a personal space for exploration rather than a theatrical performance, tapping into a modern search for connection and meaning in an unconventional setting.</p>
