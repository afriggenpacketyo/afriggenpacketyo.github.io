        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, falling short of expectations and signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite industrial output exceeding forecasts with a 6.1% increase, the National Bureau of Statistics acknowledged persistent external uncertainties and the need to bolster economic recovery. The urban unemployment rate eased slightly to 5.1%, even as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to evolve. Real estate investment saw a significant drag, falling 10.3% year-to-date, indicating continued challenges in the property sector.</p>

          <p>An unfolding corruption investigation involving staff at the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) is raising concerns about oversight in the defense sector. Detentions have been made in Belgium and the Netherlands regarding "possible irregularities" in ammunition and drone contracts, with allegations of information passed to defense contractors and money laundering through consultancy companies. The investigation, initiated by NATO itself, extends to Italy, Spain, and the U.S. This probe serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency and oversight as NATO countries increase defense spending amid the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A Chinese biotech firm, Innovent Biologics, is developing a drug called mazdutide, which is expected to receive approval for weight management and type 2 diabetes this year. This drug could compete with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk in the global market for diabetes drugs used for treating obesity. The global market for these drugs is expected to expand in Asia, particularly in China and Japan, where penetration is low. More competition in the market is expected to lead to more choices for patients and physicians and lower prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan plans to implement pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers by fiscal year 2028 to enhance efficiency and further boost inbound tourism. The system, modeled after the U.S. ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide personal and travel information before arrival. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency to examine traveler data in advance and deny boarding to those with criminal records or histories of illegal stays. The goal is to streamline immigration processes while maintaining security as Japan aims to attract 60 million foreign visitors by 2030.</p>
