          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if they gain power, aiming to distinguish themselves from Labour. These commitments, set to be revealed at a press conference, follow pressure on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to alter his stance on these policies. Reform UK intends to fund these initiatives by reducing net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move seeks to capitalize on divisions within the Labour party regarding these social welfare measures.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, Japan, with visitors cringing and expressing concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to swat them away to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled, prompting health advisories. Expo organizers are spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the problem, while Osaka Gov.

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault‚Äù reshaped the modern understanding of sexual assault, has died at 90. Published in 1975, the book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, influencing legal reforms and the establishment of rape-crisis centers. Brownmiller's work faced criticism for its sweeping generalizations and perceived anti-male bias. Despite the controversies, her book remains a landmark contribution to feminist thought and legal reform.</p>
