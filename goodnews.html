The game between Auckland City and Boca Juniors was marked by high temperatures and passionate Boca supporters, with Auckland City scoring their first goal of the tournament shortly before the weather suspension.

          <p>Starbucks is standardizing pricing for beverage add-ins, charging 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce modifying an unflavored drink. The company will not charge for substituting sauces or syrups in pre-flavored drinks. A scoop of matcha powder added to non-matcha drinks will cost $1, and dried fruit in beverages will be 50 cents. This change is part of CEO Brian Niccol's efforts to improve customer service and the overall Starbucks experience. Customers can still add classic syrup to any drink at no cost.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and announcing plans to trim an additional $1 billion in the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. While FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling below expectations, the company's long-term cost-cutting initiative, DRIVE, aims to improve profitability. The company anticipates a $170 million headwind from international exports due to global trade policy impacts in its fiscal first quarter of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price rose following the announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, alongside the unveiling of a major crypto bill in the Senate. The proposed legislation aims to define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and reducing the SEC's regulatory role. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev emphasized the importance of this regulatory development for the U.S. to regain its lead in the crypto industry. Additionally, investors increased their bets on crypto company Digital Asset, which raised $135 million in funding from major banking and finance firms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has dismissed all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing changes in California law that narrowed the definition of gang activity. The decision follows legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued that the injunctions were racially biased and violated California's Racial Justice Act. Gang injunctions are civil court orders that restrict suspected gang members from certain activities and associations within designated areas. Critics argue that these injunctions disproportionately target Latino communities and infringe on civil liberties, leading to restrictions on everyday activities. The DA's office said it could seek new injunctions if the need arises under the revised definition of gang activity.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to hand over documents detailing the activities of military troops deployed in Southern California. This ruling marks a procedural victory for California in its effort to oversee the troops under the president's command. The order authorizes California lawyers to depose key administration officials and raises questions about the duration of federal control over the troops. The state is challenging the legality of the troop deployment, arguing that it violates the Posse Comitatus Act by having soldiers support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations.</p>

The lawsuit was filed by authors who claimed Anthropic's practices amounted to "large-scale theft" and sought to profit from their works.</p>
