          <p>President Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a visit to U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania, coinciding with ongoing discussions about a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Trump described the deal as a "partnership" that would keep U.S. Steel headquarters in Pittsburgh and involve a $14 billion investment by Nippon. However, details remain scarce despite Trump's assurances that the deal will be controlled by the USA, with concerns raised about national security and supply chains. Senator Dave McCormick indicated the U.S. government would have a "golden share" to ensure production levels are maintained. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is rapidly expanding the use of AI in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative, deploying technologies like patrol drones to monitor urban areas. Nanjing, for example, uses AI to plan patrol routes and focus on areas often overlooked by human patrols. While China's progress in AI governance is significant, challenges remain, including privacy protection and limited community involvement. These challenges are mirrored in other countries as governments increasingly adopt AI technology.</p>

She consumed 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates per hour during the race to maintain her energy and milk supply.

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Core prices, excluding food and energy, rose 2.5%, below the March figure of 2.7%. While economists have warned that President Trump's tariffs could push prices higher, there is little sign of tariff impact. Americans also cooled off on spending, potentially due to caution over higher goods prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policy by maintaining its recommendation that children may receive COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy had previously stated that the vaccine would no longer appear on the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC's update counters Kennedy's policy, reaffirming the agency's stance on the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for children. This divergence highlights differing views within the government on public health policy.</p>
