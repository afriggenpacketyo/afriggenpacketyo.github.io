        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles III and French President Emmanuel Macron are undertaking a three-day state visit aimed at reinvigorating the UK-France relationship, particularly post-Brexit. The visit, involving ceremonial events at Windsor and Westminster, seeks to strengthen partnerships in trade, diplomacy, and defense, especially concerning issues like military backing for Ukraine and illegal migration across the Channel. King Charles's active role in diplomacy, including his fluency in French and past engagements with European leaders, is highlighted as crucial in resetting ties. This engagement reflects a mutual strategic necessity and a new willingness to address long-standing divisions, despite lingering mistrust from Brexit negotiations.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy New Yorkers Support Socialist Mayoral Candidate Advocating Higher Taxes</h2>

          <p>Surprisingly, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a socialist advocating for higher taxes on the wealthy to fund expansive social programs, has garnered support from several millionaires. Venture capitalist James Hueston, part of the "Mamdani Millionaires" group, expressed belief in paying his "fair share" for beneficial policies, asserting that Mamdani's tax increases are for "explicitly good policies." Voting data indicates about a third of the city's wealthiest residents supported Mamdani in the primary, with many donors remaining anonymous. Business leaders like Kathy Wylde note Mamdani's acknowledgment of private supply's role in addressing the housing crisis, suggesting a nuanced approach to his platform and a complex dynamic within NYC's political landscape.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia's B200 GPUs Face Supply Shortages Amid High Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's B200 GPUs are selling faster than the company can produce them, leading to perpetual back-orders despite increased production, according to Wedbush analysts. Nvidia is prioritizing these powerful GPUs for supercomputing outfits, cloud builders, and sovereign data centers, influencing strong performance for companies like Dell and Gigabyte. The report also notes a pickup in standard server demand and anticipates Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gaining more CPU sockets in 2025. Additionally, a shortage of hard drive heads means Western Digital and Seagate can continue raising prices and boosting margins, indicating a strong market for chip and storage stocks.

          <p>Following the devastating flash floods in Central Texas that have claimed over 100 lives, numerous organizations are mobilizing to provide relief and recovery assistance. More than a foot of rain in less than 12 hours caused the Guadalupe River to surge, necessitating extensive search and rescue operations. Several key funds and charities are now accepting donations to support affected communities and first responders. These include the Kerr County Flood Relief Fund, Southern Oaks Church, TEXSAR, Texans on Mission, Salvation Army Kerrville, Good Shepherd Episcopal School, American Red Cross, Texas Progressive Caucus, and Mercy Chefs, all working to address the immediate and long-term needs of the region.</p>

          <h2>UK Liberal Democrats Propose Free-to-Air Premier League Games</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 18:08:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have tabled an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill, aiming to make at least 10 Premier League games available on free-to-air television each season. This proposal, which also includes the League Cup Final and lower league play-off finals, seeks to widen public access to major sporting events, similar to a law in Spain. The party argues that the "jewel in the crown of British football" has been unfairly locked behind expensive subscription paywalls, costing fans £660 annually. While the government currently has no plans to review the listed events regime, the Lib Dems are confident a vote will be granted, potentially revolutionizing football viewership and accessibility.</p>

          <p>China is implementing a new trade war strategy by focusing on the development of its historically poorest provinces, such as Guizhou, as part of its 2026-2030 development plan. Provincial leaders are actively aligning with the national "strategic hinterland strategy," introduced in December 2023, to leverage comparative advantages and serve broader national goals. This initiative aims to reshape China's economic and industrial landscape by fostering growth in less developed regions, promising significant investment and policy support. The move suggests a strategic shift to bolster domestic resilience and internal markets, potentially mitigating external trade pressures and fostering more balanced national development in the face of global economic uncertainties.</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Ban Misconduct and Discrimination NDAs in Workplaces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 17:44:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill, expected to become law later this year, will void confidentiality agreements preventing workers from speaking about such allegations. This significant move, championed by campaigners like Zelda Perkins who famously broke her NDA with Harvey Weinstein, aims to curb the widespread misuse of NDAs to cover up criminality and abuse of power. The change aligns the UK with countries like Ireland and the U.S. Employment rights minister Justin Madders called the practice "appalling," stating the amendment will empower workers and promote accountability and transparency in the workplace.</p>

          <p>A New Jersey Coast Guard rescue swimmer, Scott Ruskan, is being lauded as a hero for his pivotal role in saving over 165 individuals from the deadly Texas floods. On his first mission, Ruskan navigated severe weather to reach Camp Mystic, where hundreds were trapped, and established a triage center on the ground. He and his team performed crucial airlifts, as bridges and roadways were impassable for other rescue methods. Ruskan comforted traumatized children and credited his crew, while his family expressed immense pride in his dedication to saving lives, highlighting the profound impact of individual bravery during the disaster.</p>

          <p>The UK's national emergency alert system for mobile phones will undergo its second nationwide test on September 7th at 3:00 PM BST. Compatible smartphones on 4G or 5G networks will vibrate and emit a siren sound for 10 seconds, even if set to silent. Intended for imminent dangers like extreme weather or terror attacks, the system's previous 2023 test revealed technical issues, with some users not receiving or receiving multiple alerts. The Cabinet Office aims to address these problems and ensure public familiarity with the system, which has proven "invaluable" in regional deployments, such as for Storm Eowyn and a World War Two bomb evacuation in Plymouth. Domestic abuse charities have advised victims with hidden phones on how to opt out for safety.</p>

Experts like Rachel Corsie and Eni Aluko praise their comprehensive style, noting their ability to dominate possession and create numerous chances. While Montse Tome's side believes they still have "room for improvement," their recent inclusion of a more direct playing style adds another dimension. Despite their dominance, the article suggests potential vulnerabilities in breaking their press, offering hope to future opponents.</p>
