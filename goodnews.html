          <p>Ukraine's Operation Spider's Web, which involved smuggling drones into Russia to attack airbases, holds important lessons for China regarding modern warfare. Despite lacking long-range missiles, Ukraine successfully targeted Russian airbases by using drones transported undetected and launched remotely. This innovative approach, as noted by US Air Force Chief of Staff David Allvin, highlights the vulnerability of seemingly impenetrable locations in the era of drone technology. Chinese military analyst Fu Qianshao suggests that China needs to guard against similar infiltration tactics targeting its military bases, especially given the potential for such attacks to be carried out by secret services or in special military operations.</p>

          <p>Susan Dominus, after a decade of interviewing parents of highly successful children, identifies five key factors that set them apart. These include fostering optimism and a belief in possibility, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, and recognizing that learning and empowerment can happen anywhere. Parents also cultivate a genuine love for knowledge, often through travel, and prioritize love and support over being a coach or critic. These strategies emphasize creating a nurturing environment that encourages curiosity and self-sufficiency, rather than solely focusing on hard work and grit.</p>

          <p>Merryl Hoffman experienced a sudden cardiac arrest while walking to the subway in New York City, and her life was saved by two passing nurses. Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, nurses at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, administered CPR until an ambulance arrived, ensuring Hoffman's survival. Hoffman, who had a history of heart issues, had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent future cardiac arrests.
