        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched a new "Instant Checkout" tool for ChatGPT, enabling users to purchase products directly within the AI chat interface. Initially partnering with U.S. Etsy sellers and payment processor Stripe, the feature marks ChatGPT's entry into agentic commerce, where the AI acts as a shopping assistant. A future integration with Shopify will expand access to over a million vendors, with OpenAI earning a small fee on transactions. The technology currently supports single-item purchases, aiming to streamline the process from product discovery to checkout.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda is projected to strengthen into a hurricane but is expected to curve away from the southeastern United States. As of Monday, the storm was bringing heavy rain to the northwestern Bahamas, with its center located about 205 miles from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The National Hurricane Center predicts Imelda will turn east-northeast, moving toward Bermuda by Wednesday, for which a hurricane watch has been issued. While direct landfall in the U.S. is not anticipated, swells from the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced new parental control features for ChatGPT in response to growing concerns about the safety of its younger users. The update allows parents to link their accounts with their teenagers' accounts to customize settings and restrict age-inappropriate content, such as graphic material or violent role-play. A key feature includes a notification system that alerts parents via email and text if the AI detects signs of potential self-harm in a teen's conversations. This move follows public pressure and a wrongful death lawsuit, prompting OpenAI to create a more safeguarded experience for users between 13 and 18.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the student financial aid startup Frank, has been sentenced to over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Javice was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud after she vastly overstated her company's customer base to secure a $175 million acquisition by the bank in 2021. Prosecutors revealed that Frank had fewer than 300,000 real users, not the five million she claimed, with the rest being fabricated data. In addition to the prison sentence, Javice was ordered to pay over $300 million in forfeiture and restitution.</p>

          <p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon has stated that artificial intelligence will "literally change every job," urging workers to adapt to the technology's growing presence in the workplace. McMillon expects white-collar roles to be affected first as AI tools handle tasks in customer service and supply chain management, but notes that store and warehouse jobs will also evolve. He advised employees to embrace new AI tools to enhance their productivity and stay relevant, a concept he calls getting "plussed up." While Walmart plans to freeze its headcount for three years, McMillon emphasized that human soft skills like communication and critical thinking will remain highly valuable.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the extensive career of songwriter and musician Sonny Curtis, a key figure in early rock 'n' roll and a prolific songwriter. Curtis was a childhood friend and early bandmate of Buddy Holly before Holly's rise to fame with The Crickets. After Holly's death, Curtis joined The Crickets and penned enduring hits like "I Fought the Law" and the Everly Brothers' "Walk Right Back." He is perhaps most widely known for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the iconic theme song for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," which he wrote in a few hours based on a brief show summary.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 53, making California the first state to enact legislation focused on safety and transparency for large-scale AI models. The new law requires companies developing powerful "frontier" AI systems to disclose their safety protocols, conduct risk evaluations, and report critical safety incidents like cyberattacks to the state. Authored by Senator Scott Wiener, the bill aims to establish "commonsense guardrails" to build public trust in the rapidly evolving technology. The law also includes whistleblower protections for employees and grants the Attorney General authority to impose civil penalties for violations.</p>

          <p>A year after devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, local whitewater raft guides are leading a cleanup mission. With most rafting companies closed for the season due to debris and ongoing restoration, many guides have been hired through state-funded grants to clear the riverbanks of trash and wreckage. The 2024 storm caused massive landslides that filled the river gorge with debris, making it unsafe for recreation. This community-led effort aims to restore the watershed, providing work for displaced guides and preparing the popular outdoor tourism destination for a potential reopening next season.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Boston was forced to abort its takeoff at Los Angeles International Airport after a cargo plane crossed onto its runway without authorization. The American Airlines pilot slammed on the brakes while traveling at approximately 167 miles per hour to avoid a collision. Air traffic control had directed the AeroLogic cargo flight to cross a different runway, but the pilots mistakenly turned into the path of the departing passenger jet. The FAA is investigating the incident, and the American Airlines flight was able to depart safely for Boston after a 2.5-hour delay.</p>
