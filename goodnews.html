          <p>President Trump will visit a U.S. Steel mill in Pennsylvania as the deal between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel nears finalization, which he touts as an investment controlled by the United States. The agreement, which was initially blocked by former President Joe Biden on national security grounds, will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania. The revised deal includes a golden share provision, requiring U.S. government approval for key board members to ensure production levels are maintained. While the United Steelworkers union opposes the sale, U.S. Steel has warned that without the acquisition, the company would pivot away from blast furnace facilities, risking thousands of jobs. This article provides context to a potentially positive turn of events for a crucial sector of the economy.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has declared autism an ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù and launched a federal effort to identify environmental toxins as the primary cause, a view contested by many autism scientists. These scientists argue that genetic factors are the most significant driver of autism's development, supported by the identification of hundreds of genes associated with the condition. They fear that Kennedy's focus on environmental toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to promising new therapies. Experts suggest that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding definitions, better screening, and increased awareness, rather than a novel environmental toxin. The article aims to clarify misconceptions about autism and emphasizes the importance of genetic research.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 05:58:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. This decision follows technical talks between the two nations, with China citing Japan's promise to take "credible and visible measures" to ensure the safety of aquatic products. The move is seen as a sign of improving ties between China and Japan amid a trade war with the United States. While Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 prefectures, this development marks a significant step forward. The resumption of seafood exports is contingent upon completing the registration process and passing radiation checks.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, a leading South Korean presidential candidate, indicated a potential shift in his stance on China, suggesting that U.S. troops in South Korea could play a "critical" role in containing China. During an interview, Lee also mentioned that Washington‚Äôs recent rapprochement with Moscow could benefit Seoul through the opening of Arctic shipping routes. This shift contrasts with his previous stance, where he described the American military in Korea as ‚Äúoccupation forces‚Äù. The progressive DPK, led by Lee, has generally been viewed as more diplomatically friendly toward China compared to the conservative PPP.

This year's bee celebrated its 100th anniversary, and Faizan may be remembered for a word he got wrong more than one he got right.

          <p>China's power grid is now equipped with a quantum-powered "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic collapses by detecting grid instability in real time with unprecedented precision. Designed by a team from the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, the device acts as a high-precision sentinel for power lines. This innovation addresses the challenge of integrating weather-dependent renewables into the grid, which can strain traditional monitoring systems. The urgency for such technology was highlighted by recent outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as in China‚Äôs Xinjiang region.</p>

          <p>An op-ed on Fox News argues that President Trump should maintain a tough stance on tariffs against the European Union to address the ballooning U.S. trade deficit. The author contends that the EU has historically engaged in protectionism and has not reciprocated fair trade practices. The piece advocates for the U.S. to demand significant concessions from the EU, emphasizing the need for reciprocity and gratitude for America's security guarantee. The author predicts that the EU will likely fail to make substantial concessions, leading Trump to impose significant tariffs.</p>
