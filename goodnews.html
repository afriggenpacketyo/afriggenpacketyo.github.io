          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034, according to the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This review assumes the 3% target will be met, influencing the affordability of planned measures. The review warns of emerging threats from drones and artificial intelligence, advocating for the deployment of digital experts alongside troops. Additional funding of over ¬£1.5 billion will be directed towards improving military housing conditions, addressing urgent repairs and developing new housing to meet modern standards. Optimism that the spending target will be met allows for long-term planning in the face of growing pressures.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams related to the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, known as the gaokao. The crackdown targets individuals claiming that artificial intelligence can predict exam questions, with the Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly launching the campaign. Mock papers and private tutors are reportedly selling "top secret" information, with some using AI models to attract candidates and parents.

          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice appearing on store shelves. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The rice sold out quickly at an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, with consumers expressing relief at the lower prices. The government hopes that this initiative will help curb rising rice prices affecting households.</p>
