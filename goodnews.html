        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility and diversity within Whitehall, the UK government will now restrict its main civil service internship scheme to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. This move is part of a broader initiative to establish more career paths into the senior civil service outside of London and follows critiques of the institution's perceived lack of diversity.</p>

The project, estimated to cost around $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other private donors. According to the White House, the new venue is needed to host major state functions for world leaders without relying on temporary tents. The ballroom will have a capacity for 650 seated guests and will be designed to respect the architectural heritage of the existing White House, with construction slated to begin in September.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a relatively quiet MLB trade deadline, opting for minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals made by their National League rivals. The team addressed its needs by acquiring veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, maintaining faith in its current roster. This conservative approach contrasts with last year's aggressive deadline and the significant moves made by competitors like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets. The Dodgers' front office is betting on internal improvement and the return of injured players to defend their World Series title.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing for FICO credit scores, arguing that the cost is not a barrier to home ownership. His comments follow criticism from the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which recently allowed mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore. Lansing stated that while FICO has raised its prices, a mortgage score costs only $4.95 out of thousands in closing costs. He asserted FICO's superior predictive power and market dominance in non-government-mandated sectors as evidence of its value and reliability. (not investment advice)</p>

Since announcing its last day of service, the establishment has seen massive lines of patrons wanting one final meal. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend operations, giving the restaurant more time while he seeks a new buyer who will respect its legacy as the city's oldest restaurant. Despite the temporary boom, Moses noted that the underlying business challenges, including high costs and post-pandemic demand issues, remain.</p>

          <p>After an 18-month attempt to transition to American football, Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old had been a rising star in rugby before quitting to pursue an NFL career, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs and later the Jacksonville Jaguars. However, he never played in a regular-season game and spent the 2024 season on the Jaguars' practice squad. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit stated it was time to come home and get back to doing what he does best.</p>

          <p>China's on-demand delivery market is intensifying as giants Meituan and JD.com invest heavily in centralized kitchens to streamline their takeaway services. Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are food court-style hubs where various chains can operate kitchens exclusively for delivery, aiming to cut costs and boost efficiency. Meanwhile, JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own "7Fresh" kitchens over the next three years. These strategies mark a significant escalation in the infrastructure war between the country's leading delivery platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. While frustrating for borrowers, the current environment continues to offer relatively high yields on savings products, with many CD rates still above 4%. This article suggests that now may be an ideal time to renew a CD or shop for a new one to lock in these elevated rates before any future cuts occur. Savers are advised to act before their current CD automatically rolls over, potentially into an account with a less favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma experienced a massive 250% stock price increase on its first day of trading, creating a paper windfall of approximately $24 billion for its four main venture capital backers. The successful IPO is a bright spot for Silicon Valley, which has seen a prolonged drought in major tech public offerings. The deal almost didn't happen, as Figma's planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe collapsed last year due to regulatory pressure. Now valued at nearly $68 billion, Figma's market debut signals renewed investor appetite for tech IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

The Mac division also saw robust growth, while the services unit continued its steady climb. Despite these positive results, Apple anticipates facing about $1.1 billion in tariff-related costs in the upcoming quarter, though it still projects continued revenue growth.

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a high-yield savings account and a money market account for a $20,000 deposit. In the current elevated interest rate environment, both options offer strong returns. Based on current average rates, a high-yield savings account would earn slightly more over a one-year period than a money market account due to a marginally higher interest rate. However, the article notes that the difference is minimal and savers should also consider other features, such as the check-writing capabilities often available with money market accounts.
