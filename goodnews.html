          <p>The rapid expansion of artificial intelligence is creating an unprecedented demand for electricity, adding new urgency to bipartisan efforts in the U.S. Congress for permitting reform. Lawmakers and industry leaders warn that the current energy grid and regulatory processes are unprepared for the power needs of new AI data centers, which could consume up to 9% of U.S. electricity by 2030. Proponents of reform, like the American Petroleum Institute, argue that without streamlining the approval of new energy projects, the U.S. risks falling behind competitors like China and facing skyrocketing energy costs for consumers. The debate centers on balancing deregulation with environmental protection to support future technological growth.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his show after Disney suspended the program for his jokes regarding the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which followed threats from the FCC to review ABC's broadcast license, sparked a national debate on free speech. Disney announced the show's return after 'thoughtful conversations' with Kimmel, a decision praised by free speech advocates but met with resistance from some affiliate station groups like Sinclair, which will not air the program. The controversy highlights the intense political pressures facing media companies and entertainers in the current climate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a massive, hidden telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a significant threat to national security, especially during the UN General Assembly. The operation uncovered over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards capable of crippling cell towers, jamming emergency services, and flooding networks with disruptive traffic. Investigators believe the system, which cost millions to establish, was used by nation-state actors to send encrypted messages to organized crime and terrorist groups. While no specific plot against the UN was found, the takedown highlights a new frontier of threats targeting critical communications infrastructure.</p>

          <p>This article provides a financial analysis of MercadoLibre, exploring its current valuation in light of its strong growth momentum and recent launch of a new B2B platform. While a discounted cash flow model suggests the e-commerce and fintech giant may be undervalued due to its potential in the expanding B2B market, a market-based valuation approach indicates it could be overpriced compared to industry peers. The analysis highlights key factors for investors to consider, pointing to both potential rewards and warning signs that could influence the company's stock performance. It encourages investors to conduct their own research into the company's financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, defended the government's 2026 budget proposal against accusations from opposition parties that it uses debt to fund pet projects rather than meaningful investment. Klingbeil asserted that the government plans to invest €126.7 billion in critical areas like infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, using special funds to secure jobs and stimulate economic growth. The debate comes as the OECD slightly lowered Germany's economic growth forecast, highlighting the challenges the nation faces. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn confirmed the appointment of Evelyn Palla as its first female CEO, tasked with improving the rail operator's customer service.</p>

          <p>This article explores the nature of autism and addresses President Trump's recent, unproven claims linking it to the use of Tylenol (paracetamol) during pregnancy. It clarifies that autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition with a complex mix of genetic and environmental causes, not a single one. While some studies have shown a potential association between acetaminophen use and neurodevelopmental disorders, a causal link has not been established, and other studies have found no connection. Medical bodies worldwide continue to recommend paracetamol as the safest option for pain and fever during pregnancy, emphasizing that untreated high fevers can pose risks to the baby.</p>

          <p>A decrease in sexual desire is a common experience for many new parents, stemming from a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and emotional adjustments. This article explores the reasons behind a potential drop in libido after childbirth, affecting both women and men. Experts, including a sex therapist and an OB-GYN, explain that factors like lower estrogen levels can cause physical discomfort, while the transition to parenthood can create emotional stress. Open communication between partners is highlighted as a crucial tool for navigating this period, as it helps remove pressure and manage expectations until intimacy naturally returns.</p>
