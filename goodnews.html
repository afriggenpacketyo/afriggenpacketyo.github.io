          <p>British fintech firm Wise has announced plans to move its primary listing location to the U.S., a move that is considered a blow to the London stock exchange. The company intends to establish a dual listing, with its main listing hub shifting to the U.S. while maintaining a secondary listing in London. Wise stated that this move would allow its shares to trade on both a US stock exchange and the LSE. Shares of Wise experienced a 7% increase in early morning trading following the announcement.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections about the potential impact on contraception. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro, and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives in overweight or obese individuals, necessitating the use of condoms or alternative contraceptive methods. The MHRA acted after receiving reports relating to unintended pregnancies, emphasizing the need for clear communication about the risks and benefits of these medications.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the war. More than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center following the discovery of the bombs during road construction. Experts completed the defusal process within about an hour, according to city authorities. The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, nursing homes, museums, office buildings, and the Messe/Deutz train station. The discovery and defusal of unexploded bombs remain a frequent occurrence in Germany, even decades after the war's end.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, noting differing attitudes toward women's and transgender rights activism. Polls reveal that younger people are more likely to disagree with the legal definition of "woman" being based on biological sex. The author challenges the notion that older generations are simply reactionary, arguing that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist. She suggests that life experiences, such as childbirth and menopause, contribute to a greater awareness of biological sex and its implications. The author concludes that the Equality Act, with its protection of sex-based rights, remains vital.</p>

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often complicated medical needs. These dogs put their lives at risk in the line of duty, and many suffer from chronic health issues and injuries as a result of their service. Laura Meller, who has adopted three retired police dogs, estimates she has spent ¬£12,000 on their care. She and others worry that rising vet costs could deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for older dogs. Nottinghamshire Police started paying pensions to its retiring dogs in 2013, but the Home Office currently has no plans to change the retirement process.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting solar power, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The report highlights that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants that China helped finance, leading to stranded assets. It also stresses the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing due to rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive to be realistic. The report suggests that China and Pakistan need to evolve from an importer-exporter relationship to co-creators of a home-grown clean-energy innovation ecosystem.</p>
