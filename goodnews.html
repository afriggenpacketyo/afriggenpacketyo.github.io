          <p>Shanghai is hosting its eighth annual World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) this weekend, themed "Global Solidarity in the AI Era," as China intensifies its competition with the U.S. for leadership in artificial intelligence. The conference will feature renowned international scientists and business leaders, including Nobel laureate Geoffrey Hinton and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, showcasing China's advancements in AI. This event unfolds shortly after the White House released its AI Action Plan, designed to bolster American AI exports and restrict Chinese AI models, underscoring the heated geopolitical race to define the future of this transformative technology.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Preference for Extroverted Robots, Relatability to Neurotic Ones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Chicago study found that while people generally prefer interacting with extroverted robots, they surprisingly find neurotic robots more human-like and relatable. The research involved museum visitors interacting with a robot designed with varying personalities, including bland, extroverted, and neurotic traits. Participants described the neurotic robot as understanding deep emotions and "trying to get by in the world," fostering a sense of shared introspection. This challenges previous research that predominantly focused on extroversion, suggesting neurotic traits could be valuable for specific robot applications like comedy, despite concerns for critical roles such as autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Debate Whether AI Exhibits "Scheming" Behavior or Human Overattribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper challenges claims that current AI systems are "scheming" or "deceptive," arguing that such interpretations often stem from flawed evidence, cherry-picked anecdotes, and an overattribution of human-like traits. Led by Oxford neuroscientist Christopher Summerfield, the researchers draw parallels to past overinterpretations of ape language studies, suggesting a similar bias among AI experts who believe superhuman AI is imminent. The article distinguishes between an AI's capability to perform certain actions under specific instructions and its propensity to initiate such behaviors autonomously. It advocates for more rigorous research to understand true AI risks without anthropomorphizing the technology, emphasizing the need for humility in assessing AI cognition.</p>

          <p>Three miners were successfully rescued after being trapped for two days underground in northern British Columbia's Red Chris mine following a collapse. The men, identified as Kevin Coumbs, Darien Maduke, and Jesse Chubaty, were found safe and in good spirits, having sheltered in an underground refuge chamber designed for extended stays, with access to essential supplies. The rescue operation involved clearing a significant pile of debris blocking their movement after a second collapse. Mine operator Newmont confirmed the trio are receiving medical support, and a full investigation into the incident will be carried out to determine its cause.</p>

          <p>The United States and Mexico have signed a landmark agreement to tackle the decades-old problem of Tijuana River sewage polluting California beaches. The accord outlines specific steps and a new timetable, with Mexico committing $93 million to infrastructure projects by 2027 and the U.S. expanding its South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant. This bilateral effort aims to halt the flow of billions of gallons of raw sewage and toxic chemicals that have closed beaches and sickened residents and Navy SEALs. Officials from both nations praised the renewed commitment, hoping to resolve a seemingly intractable environmental and public health crisis.</p>

This comes as negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv discussed a potential direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul, a format Ukraine has pushed for, with hopes for U.S. President Trump's involvement. While Russia downplayed the immediacy of a leaders' summit, Ukraine aims for a deal by late August, aligning with a deadline set by Trump for a peace agreement to avoid sweeping sanctions.</p>

          <p>A group of doctors, including obstetrics and women's health experts, are urging the FDA to remove "black box" warning labels from low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments for menopause symptoms. They argue these strong warnings, which mention risks like cancer and dementia, are scientifically unsupported for local treatments and unduly scare women away from beneficial medication. While the medical consensus on hormone therapy has evolved, with some risks previously overstated, the FDA commissioner supports reevaluating the labels. Critics, however, express concern about the process, advocating for more rigorous scientific evaluation and public input before such significant changes.</p>

It also addresses concerns about refereeing, noting that while WNBA officials are paid less than NBA counterparts, player actions often escalate on-court incidents.
