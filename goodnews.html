          <p>An evening with DBS Group CEO Tan Su Shan was auctioned for S$18,900 ($14,790) to benefit Singapore's National Gallery. The experience, which includes a private dinner and gallery tour, sold for more than double its estimate, highlighting a common fundraising practice of offering meals with high-profile business leaders. The funds raised from the gala event, totaling over S$2.8 million, will support the museum's mission to make art accessible through new exhibitions and community programs. This follows a trend of high-value charity auctions, such as one where a bidder paid $19 million to dine with Warren Buffett.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced £150 billion in new investment pledges from U.S. firms, coinciding with President Donald Trump's state visit. Major contributions include £90 billion from Blackstone and significant commitments from Microsoft and Google, which are expected to create thousands of jobs. However, the announcement comes as some pharmaceutical companies halt UK investments, citing a challenging business environment, and domestic business investment appears to be slowing. Critics have described the investment as "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," arguing it doesn't solve the UK's issue of exporting its own tech start-ups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK includes high-level meetings and royal pageantry, marking a departure from the tradition of not offering a second state visit to a president. After spending Wednesday with King Charles III at Windsor Castle, Trump is scheduled for talks on Thursday with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at Chequers to discuss economic deals. First Lady Melania Trump will remain at Windsor for separate engagements. The visit, initiated by an invitation from King Charles via Starmer, has been described as "unprecedented" and involves significant security and logistical arrangements, including the deployment of Air Force One.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Huawei has unveiled new AI computing systems powered by its in-house Ascend chips, positioning itself as a direct competitor to U.S.-based Nvidia. The company plans to launch its "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, which it claims will be the world's most powerful, using over 500,000 chips to overcome U.S. sanctions restricting access to advanced semiconductors. Huawei's rotating chairman, Eric Xu, asserted that the new system would deliver significantly more computing power than Nvidia's upcoming products. This move highlights China's strategy of achieving technological self-reliance in AI by clustering domestically produced chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The formation of Tropical Storm Gabrielle in the central Atlantic has ended a nearly three-week storm-free period during the peak of the hurricane season. The storm, currently located far from land, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday as it moves northwest. While it is not expected to directly impact the United States, it may generate high surf along the East Coast next week. This year's season has been unusually quiet despite warm ocean waters, largely due to unfavorable atmospheric conditions like dry air and wind shear that have suppressed storm development, making Gabrielle's formation notable.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record on Thursday, closing over 1% higher, as Asian markets showed a mixed response to the U.S. Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of two more potential cuts this year, influencing investor sentiment across the region. While South Korea's Kospi also gained, markets in Hong Kong and mainland China slipped. Chip-related stocks in Asia saw a boost following reports of China banning certain Nvidia AI chips, with companies like SK Hynix and TSMC seeing gains. (not investment advice)</p>

The pan-European Stoxx 600 index saw gains, with banking stocks like Santander and Deutsche Bank rising, as the Fed's move signaled a less aggressive stance than some had feared. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell tempered expectations of a lengthy cutting cycle, describing the move as "risk management" and projecting only two more reductions this year.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that its once-daily oral version of the obesity drug Wegovy produced "significant" weight reduction in a late-stage trial. The results showed an average weight loss of 16.6% after 64 weeks, comparable to its popular injectable counterpart, offering patients a needle-free alternative. The pill, which uses the same active ingredient, semaglutide, is currently under review by the U.S. FDA, with a decision expected later this year. This development intensifies the competition in the lucrative oral obesity drug market, as rival Eli Lilly is also advancing its own pill, Orforglipron.</p>
