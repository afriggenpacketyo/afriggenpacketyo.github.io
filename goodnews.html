          <h2>Nvidia Receives US Approval for Advanced AI Chip Sales to China</h2>

          <p>Technology giant Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 computer chips, used for artificial intelligence, to China. This decision reverses a previous policy that restricted such sales over national security concerns. CEO Jensen Huang announced the development, stating that the U.S. government has assured licenses will be granted, a move seen as beneficial for Nvidia's revenue and the global semiconductor supply chain. However, analysts caution that Chinese firms will likely continue pursuing domestic chip development due to the potential for future U.S. policy shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of approximately $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The steep price is attributed to India's high tariffs on imported electric vehicles and luxury taxes, positioning the car in the premium segment against brands like BMW. Analysts suggest this initial launch is a strategy to "test the waters" rather than achieve mass-market sales. The company's future pricing and manufacturing decisions in India may depend on potential changes to EV policies and trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

His move marks a return to English football after brief stints in Saudi Arabia with Al-Ettifaq and then with Ajax, and he recently received an England national team recall.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "The Dry Season," writer Melissa Febos recounts her decision to abstain from sex and dating for a year at age 35 to reset her relationship with intimacy. Following a devastating breakup, she found that a period of celibacy helped her redirect energy toward herself, strengthening her friendships, creative work, and political activism. Febos explains that the experience allowed her to discover a deeper sense of self and find sensuality in other aspects of life, such as nature and art. She ultimately credits this period of abstinence with enabling her to build a healthier, more honest long-term partnership.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are gaining significant attention from major corporations and lawmakers, with Congress considering the GENIUS Act to create a regulatory framework. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, stablecoins are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, promising safer and faster global money transfers without traditional banking intermediaries. While proponents see a revolution in payments, critics raise concerns about their actual safety, the adequacy of reserves held by issuers, and their potential use in illicit activities. The debate centers on balancing their innovative potential against the risks they could pose to the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nextdoor, the social network for neighborhoods, is attempting a major turnaround after its stock value plummeted since its 2021 market debut. Co-founder Nirav Tolia has returned as CEO to spearhead a new strategy aimed at increasing user engagement beyond posts about lost pets and local complaints. The plan involves featuring more local news, providing timely emergency alerts, and integrating an AI chatbot for recommendations. Analysts remain skeptical, pointing to stiff competition from larger platforms and the need for Nextdoor to innovate its advertising capabilities to prove its new direction can drive revenue growth.</p>

          <p>England's Lionesses have advanced to the Euro 2025 quarter-finals, but their performance shows a notable contrast to their victorious 2022 campaign. While their attack has been potent, with eight different players scoring, their defense has appeared more vulnerable, conceding three goals in the group stage compared to none in 2022. The team has shown resilience, bouncing back from an opening loss to France with decisive wins. Coach Sarina Wiegman has also been more flexible with her lineup and substitutions, which has paid off in later group matches, demonstrating the team's ability to adapt.</p>

          <p>The price discount between the Hong Kong-listed H shares and mainland-listed A shares of dual-listed Chinese companies has shrunk to its smallest point in nearly five years. This narrowing gap is driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, which is spurring global investors to diversify into Hong Kong's market, and strong buying from mainland investors seeking exposure to top technology firms. The Hang Seng China AH Premium Index, which tracks this disparity, shows H shares are now trading only 22% below their onshore counterparts, a significant reduction from the recent average.

          <p>Social media platform Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which requires robust age checks for sites showing adult material. Starting this week, users attempting to access certain mature content will need to verify their age through a third-party firm using a selfie or government ID. Reddit stated it will not access the photo and will only retain the user's verification status. The move comes as regulator Ofcom expects other platforms to adopt similar measures or face significant fines and potential business disruption measures.</p>
