          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July due to a recent cyber-attack that occurred over the Easter weekend. The ransomware attack, suspected to be the work of Scattered Spider using tools from DragonForce, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments. M&S estimates the cyber-attack will reduce profits for the current year by around ¬£300 million, a significant hit to their earnings. Despite the disruption, CEO Stuart Machin asserts the company's turnaround strategy remains unchanged, viewing the incident as an opportunity to accelerate the pace of change.</p>

          <p>The cast of the US comedy series Cheers has paid tribute to George Wendt, who played Norm Peterson, after his death at the age of 76. Wendt starred as Norm in all 275 episodes of Cheers and earned six consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding supporting actor in a comedy series. Ted Danson, who played bar boss Sam Malone, said he was devastated, while Kelsey Grammer, who played Frasier Crane, said he liked George a lot and that he was beloved by millions. Wendt also appeared in several movies and had been married to fellow actor Bernadette Birkett since 1978, with whom he had three children.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed an immunity to multiple types of venom. Researchers are studying Friede's blood in hopes of synthesizing a universal antivenom that could be used for various snake bites. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snakes bite between one and three million people annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms are typically derived from animals injected with small amounts of specific venoms to produce neutralizing antibodies.</p>

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the US, is anticipated to confront the rise of Trumpian nationalism, potentially creating conflict with Maga Catholics. His predecessor, Pope Francis, championed progressive causes, leading some on the Maga right to caricature Leo as a continuity pontiff. The new pope's choice of name signals his recognition of the challenge posed by right-wing populism, mirroring Leo XIII's mission to address economic inequalities and the dangers of state idolatry. Leo XIV aims to address issues like wars, climate change, inequality, and migration, contrasting with the Maga worldview.</p>

          <p>Several Democrats are openly expressing interest in running for president in 2028, abandoning the traditional denial of such ambitions. Governors Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Tim Walz of Minnesota, along with Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, have indicated their potential candidacies. The New York Times notes the shift in dynamic, with candidates acknowledging their interest rather than pretending otherwise. This early and open interest suggests a potentially crowded and competitive field for the Democratic nomination in 2028.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer, aiming to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial concerns amid increasingly extreme heat. The supplementary budget bill, which includes 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living due to declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer.
