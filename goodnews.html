          <h2>Self-Managed Medication Abortion Gains Acceptance Despite Political Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR report explores the increasing acceptance of self-managed medication abortion, a method where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision. The article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have prompted doctors and abortion rights advocates to reconsider safe abortion practices outside of clinical settings. Studies have shown that self-managed medication abortion is a safe and effective option, leading organizations like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. However, some clinicians remain concerned about potential political repercussions and increasing restrictions on abortion medication access.</p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, has strengthened China's economic and political ties with countries in the region. Agreements worth nearly $25 billion were signed between China and its regional partners, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. China National Nuclear Corporation will lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, further solidifying Beijing's influence. While the European Union and Russia also have interests in Central Asia, China's footprint in this strategically important region continues to expand, driven by its need for raw materials and its Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, maintains that her bloody bedroom was not a crime scene. In an interview with "48 Hours," Dorotik stated that truth and justice were not at the forefront of her case. She explained that the blood in the bedroom was due to her husband's nosebleeds and injured dogs, but authorities dismissed her explanations. Dorotik's conviction was later overturned after new evidence revealed that some blood-like stains were not blood and that the prosecutor's claims about the blood evidence were inaccurate.</p>

The scheme grants Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which is expected to boost the city's status as an international financial center and a trading hub for offshore yuan. The launch saw 2,000 Northbound and 7,400 Southbound transactions just after noon on its first day of operation.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Explore Spleen's Potential in Diabetes Treatment</h2>

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform this organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, considered a more promising long-term survival site than the liver, could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles. These findings could potentially offer a new approach to managing diabetes, which affects millions worldwide, including over 140 million adults in China.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted in 2001 for the murder of her husband Bob, has had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original investigation. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik argued that authorities focused on her from the start and failed to pursue other leads. Despite initially planning to retry her, prosecutors ultimately dropped the charges, citing insufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, new testing revealed some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout, stating that she loved her husband. The prosecution's case relied heavily on blood evidence in the bedroom, a bloody syringe, and testimony from Dorotik's sons, but the new evidence cast doubt on the original verdict, leading to the dismissal of charges.</p>
