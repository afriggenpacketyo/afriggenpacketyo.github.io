          <p>NBA star LeBron James has addressed rumors about his future after a photo of him practicing at the Cleveland Cavaliers' facility sparked speculation among fans and media. James, who is from nearby Akron, clarified on social media that he has trained at the facility every summer since it was built and still lives in the area. He dismissed the chatter as people being "bored," emphasizing his long-standing connection to his home region. The speculation arose amid ongoing conversations about whether James will retire or be traded from the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the concept of a 'citizen.' He emphasized that the nation was born from a bloody and divisive civil war, a complexity that he believes makes its founding ideals even more inspiring. Burns suggests that understanding the founders' flaws and the nation's historical divisions can provide perspective and optimism for today's polarized society. He advocates for embracing this complicated history rather than sanitizing it, viewing it as a source of strength and meaning.</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to be a single mother, stating she was being honest with herself about her capabilities within a romantic relationship at the time. Theron cited her experience growing up in a family with alcoholism and her tendency to "lose herself" in relationships as key factors. Relationship experts support her choice, framing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and alignment with her true self. They note that choosing to be single is a powerful option for women who have the resources and clarity to build their lives outside of traditional partnership structures.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-mediated proposal for a two-month ceasefire in its war with Israel. The group stated it is prepared to enter negotiations on the implementation of the framework, though it is reportedly still seeking guarantees for a complete Israeli withdrawal and an end to the war. President Trump, who announced Israel's agreement to the proposal earlier in the week, expressed optimism that a deal could be reached soon. This development marks a potentially significant step toward halting the 21-month conflict that has devastated Gaza and killed over 57,000 Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic beverage known as the "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming it can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The drink typically contains coconut water, citrus juice, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there are no scientific studies to support these claims. Doctors note that while the individual ingredients are generally harmless and can aid hydration, they are unlikely to have a direct impact on cortisol levels. They caution that tracking and medically lowering cortisol is rarely necessary and advise focusing on proven stress-reduction techniques like sleep and exercise.</p>

          <p>The only known prototype of the MingKwai typewriter, an innovative Chinese-language machine invented by Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered in a New York basement. Scholars are excited because the machine's design, which breaks down Chinese characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing. The typewriter was an ambitious attempt to bridge Eastern and Western cultures and preserve the Chinese language in a technological age. Now acquired by Stanford University, the machine is seen as a crucial artifact in the history of global technology and communication.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, public swimming is officially allowed in designated areas of the Seine River in Paris. The ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted following a $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to last year's Olympics. On Saturday, residents eagerly took a plunge in the river near the Eiffel Tower, with Mayor Anne Hidalgo present to celebrate the historic moment. Officials confirmed that water quality now meets European standards on most days, marking the fulfillment of a long-held dream to restore the iconic waterway for recreational use.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks to analyze their stomach contents, which provides vital data on the animals' health and the bay's ecosystem, before releasing them. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population indicates a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination, they find it challenging to secure financial support for their research, which is crucial for marine conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A renter in Scottsdale, Arizona, was fined $4,000 by his property management company after posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in the lease agreement that penalized tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. However, this practice is illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company stated it would remove the clause from future leases, highlighting a critical issue of consumer rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Google X executive and happiness researcher Mo Gawdat advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage emotional responses to upsetting events. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to anger or stress, such as the release of cortisol, lasts about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued distress is a result of consciously or unconsciously re-running the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously choose a different, more constructive response, thereby preventing prolonged periods of unhappiness and gaining control over one's emotional state.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the Danish emphasis on hobbies for a happy life, an Emory University professor undertook an experiment to try 17 different hobbies in one year, including pottery, tennis, and woodworking. The experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely by connecting with new communities, and become more confident. She argues that actively pursuing hobbies is the secret to achieving work-life balance, as it forces individuals to define boundaries and find joy outside of their professional and family obligations. This approach provides a practical path to greater fulfillment.</p>
