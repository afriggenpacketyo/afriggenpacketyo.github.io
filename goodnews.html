        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2023, Apple has reported a year-on-year increase in iPhone sales in China, with an 8% jump in the second quarter. This growth is largely attributed to significant price reductions and promotional offers on iPhone 16 models ahead of the popular 618 shopping festival. The positive sales figures provide a boost for Apple, which has faced challenges in the region, including stiff competition from a resurgent Huawei. Despite Apple's gains, Huawei maintained its position as the top smartphone seller in China for the quarter, with Apple ranking third. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 07:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the modern parenting trend of attempting to give children a less-structured, '90s-style summer, often called "wild summer" or "kid-rotting." However, it questions the feasibility of this approach in an era of full-time working parents, increased safety concerns, and the pervasive influence of digital devices like smartphones and tablets. While kids today have less unsupervised free time, experts note that activities like gaming can still foster critical thinking and social skills. The article concludes that while a true '90s summer is impossible, older teens are often capable of self-regulating their screen time, suggesting that unstructured time becomes more manageable with age.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu has implemented the most significant update to its core search engine in a decade, integrating advanced artificial intelligence features. The overhaul allows for longer, more conversational queries and the use of voice, images, and files as prompts, mirroring the functionality of AI chatbots like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. Analysts view this as a strategic move to defend its market position not just from traditional competitors but also from emerging AI services and short-video platforms that are increasingly used for search. This mirrors Google's efforts to enhance its own search product with AI to stay relevant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has announced it will shut down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The move is part of a strategy to consolidate its video content offerings under the Prime Video platform. After the Freevee app is discontinued, its library of shows and movies will become available to watch for free with ads directly on Prime Video, even for users without a Prime subscription. This change follows Amazon's introduction of an ad-supported tier to its main Prime Video service earlier this year, signaling a broader shift in its streaming business model.</p>

          <p>Indonesia and Malaysia are actively strengthening their relationships with Russia, signaling a shift in their foreign policy towards a more non-aligned, balanced stance. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto recently visited Moscow, skipping a G7 summit, to enhance cooperation in economics, trade, and investment. Similarly, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has made multiple visits to Russia, praising President Putin's leadership. Analysts suggest these moves are driven by a desire to diversify partnerships, avoid entanglement in the U.S.-China rivalry, and engage with alternative forums like BRICS, reflecting a growing sentiment that the Western-led global order is changing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews Casey Johnston's book, "A Physical Education," which advocates for weight lifting as a transformative practice for women, shifting the focus from shrinking one's body to building strength. Johnston's work critiques pervasive diet culture and promotes lifting as a way to reframe one's relationship with food and exercise, emphasizing eating for fuel and celebrating physical capability over aesthetics. The review explores how this mindset challenges the deeply ingrained societal pressure for women to be small, offering a path toward physical and mental empowerment. It acknowledges that even strength training can have its own pressures but ultimately presents it as a healthier approach to physical achievement.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted a new safety regulation, effective June 28, that cracks down on substandard power banks carried by air travelers. The rule mandates that all power banks must have China Compulsory Certification (CCC), a quality and safety standard mark, to be allowed on flights. This measure is intended to prevent safety hazards associated with non-compliant devices. Airports are now required to set up designated areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail any power banks that do not meet the new certification requirement, addressing concerns from wary travelers.</p>

          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, with the yield on 10-year bonds dropping to 4.52% after a previous surge. The market stabilization followed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's expression of support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had become emotional in the Commons. Analysts suggest that financial markets are backing Reeves, fearing that her departure could lead to a loss of fiscal discipline and larger deficits. This easing of nerves also saw the pound regain some lost ground, though economists warn that a risk premium is likely to persist in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court has issued a significant ruling stating that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision effectively preserves access to abortion services within the state. The ruling resolves a key legal question that arose following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The 1849 statute had been interpreted by some as a total ban, but the court's clarification ensures that abortion remains legal in Wisconsin for the time being, representing a major victory for abortion rights advocates in the region.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively working to refresh its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on signing a new center-forward and up to two attacking midfielders. The club has pursued RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, but a deal has proven difficult, leading to increased focus on Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, who is reportedly keen on the move. Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins is also being considered as a potentially more affordable option. The club's spending on a striker will influence its ability to pursue other targets like Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze to bolster its creative options.</p>
