          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in setting global standards for artificial intelligence to ensure fair and equitable governance. In a joint statement, the leaders described AI as a major opportunity for inclusive growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without proper oversight. They emphasized the need for technical protocols developed with public sector and UN involvement to guarantee trust, security, and interoperability across AI platforms. The group also proposed voluntary guidelines for non-military AI use, demanding equal access to technology and data for all countries, particularly those in the Global South.</p>

          <p>Firefighting crews are making significant progress against the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, the largest wildfire in California this year, having reached 30% containment. The blaze has scorched over 80,000 acres, threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument and its endangered species. Favorable weather and a surge in personnel, with nearly 1,400 firefighters on scene, have bolstered containment efforts. However, officials remain cautious as a midweek heatwave is forecasted, which could create more challenging conditions for crews working to protect the approximately 50 structures still under threat.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, this leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change is crucial to give people time to grieve without the pressure of returning to work before they are ready. The new law, which has been championed by campaigners and MPs, will extend the right to at least one week of leave, acknowledging the significant emotional impact of early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham reflects on her career and personal growth in an interview about her new London-set Netflix series, 'Too Much.'

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have become vastly more sophisticated, but the nature of the threat has grown more complex. This analysis examines the evolution from combating organized groups like al-Qaeda to confronting self-radicalized, 'DIY' attackers inspired by online extremism from both Islamist and far-right ideologies. The article details how intelligence sharing between MI5 and police improved, new laws were enacted, and public safety measures like 'Martyn's Law' were created. However, the diverse and unpredictable nature of modern threats means the question of whether the UK is truly safer remains a complex one.</p>
