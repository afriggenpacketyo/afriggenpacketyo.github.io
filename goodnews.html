        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper is set to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea firm JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion transaction, paying shareholders 31.85 euros per share, which represents a substantial 33% premium on the Dutch firm's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price. Following this significant acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding the 2018 merger that created the third-largest beverage company in North America. This strategic move aims to optimize business focus and enhance shareholder value within the competitive global beverage market.

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant climb, led by China and Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng Index surging over 2% to approach a four-year peak. This rally was primarily fueled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's widely anticipated speech, signaling potential monetary policy easing next month. Chinese property and technology stocks were key contributors to the gains, with the Hang Seng Tech index rising over 3%. Analysts at Goldman Sachs noted a popular view of maturing time deposits shifting into equities, sustaining momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming Premier League match between Newcastle United and Liverpool is highly anticipated, with added drama from the ongoing transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, who reportedly wishes to join Liverpool. This context, coupled with Liverpool's recent acquisition of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle had pursued, significantly heightens the stakes for the "huge" game at St James' Park. Newcastle's head coach Eddie Howe urges his team to concentrate and harness the crowd's energy, acknowledging the intense rivalry and fan sentiment surrounding the occasion.</p>

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate for July eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6%, marking its lowest level since January 2021, according to data from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Core inflation, excluding private transport and accommodation, also dipped to 0.5%, below Reuters' forecasts. The MAS attributed the moderation to falling retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas inflation. While the central bank forecasts moderate inflation in the near term, it warns of slower economic growth later this year due to global trade shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global labor markets are transitioning from the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era to a "Great Stay" and a "no-hire, no-fire" freeze, characterized by fewer employees voluntarily leaving jobs and reduced hiring/firing by employers. Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, notes that firms are putting hiring decisions on hold due to economic uncertainty, not necessarily to reduce headcount. Despite slowing hiring momentum, initial U.S. jobless claims remain near historical lows, while the U.K. also reports declining job vacancies.
