          <p>Caesar Sengupta, the co-founder and CEO of fintech startup Arta Finance, advises aspiring entrepreneurs that their greatest "superpower" is the ability to ground themselves, primarily through meditation. Having spent 15 years at Google leading major projects like Google Pay, Sengupta emphasizes that filtering out noise is crucial in the volatile startup world. His company, Arta Finance, has successfully raised over $92 million with backing from prominent investors including Google's CEO Sundar Pichai. Sengupta highlights the importance of mental and physical health to navigate the immense pressures and fragility inherent in building a new company from the ground up.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and shut down hydropower stations along the Red River, a key tributary of the upper Yangtze. The initiative aims to save the habitats of rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted for decades. The dense network of dams had restricted water flow, blocked migratory routes for fish, and reduced suitable spawning grounds. This large-scale action is intended to rejuvenate the river's ecosystem and is considered a critical step in preserving biodiversity in one of China's most important waterways.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player's social media account. The player is widely reported to be American Montrezl Harrell, a former NBA star who now plays for the Adelaide 36ers. The incident occurred following a match in November 2024, and the man faces charges for using a carriage service to menace or harass.

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first six months of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant reserves of rubidium and gold, are part of a strategic effort to enhance the country's resource security. Investment in mineral exploration saw a substantial rise, particularly for critical elements like tin, bauxite, and copper, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy industries. The government has stated its commitment to advancing strategic prospecting to strengthen national energy and mineral resource security amid a global race for these materials.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Indicates Intent to Halt Indiscriminate Immigration Stops in Los Angeles</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling signaling she will order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrant rights groups, which argued that federal agents were unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause. In the hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong challenged the government's lack of specific evidence to justify the arrests and suggested she would grant restraining orders to halt the practice and ensure detainees have access to legal counsel. The lawsuit has gained support from the city and county of Los Angeles, who argue the raids are politically motivated and strain local resources.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, part of a major sanitation project, with the collapse happening miles from the sole access point. A massive response from the LAFD, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. All workers were brought to safety without any visible injuries, and Cal/OSHA has launched an investigation into the cause of the collapse, which has put the project on an indefinite hold.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, temporarily halting the order from taking effect while the legal challenge proceeds. This ruling comes after a recent Supreme Court decision that limited the use of universal injunctions but still allows them through specific legal avenues like class-action suits. The White House criticized the decision as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court, vowing to fight the ruling.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by the California Board of Parole Hearings. Bianchi, now 74, and his cousin Angelo Buono Jr. terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, murdering 12 women. After hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors, the panel ruled that Bianchi will not be eligible for parole again for another 10 years. Bianchi pleaded guilty to multiple murders in California and Washington and agreed to testify against Buono, who was sentenced to life without parole and died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>A massive Martian meteorite, the largest piece of the red planet ever found on Earth, is being auctioned by Sotheby's and is expected to sell for as much as $4 million. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, weighs over 54 pounds and represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after traveling an estimated 140 million miles through space, likely dislodged from Mars by an asteroid impact. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this auction a significant event for collectors and scientists interested in unlocking the secrets of our planetary neighbor.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the specifics of their discussion were not disclosed, Nvidia has been navigating U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, which the Trump administration tightened in April for national security reasons. These restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the lucrative Chinese market, a major concern for the company. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post, attributing its rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris are turning once again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds in an accident. The celebrated return was marked by a street performance of the can-can by 60 dancers and a fireworks display from the cabaret's roof. The original collapse in April 2024 was due to a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed last summer for the Olympics, delays with a new motor kept them stationary. The restoration of this iconic symbol of Parisian nightlife, immortalized by art and film, was a joyous event for locals and tourists alike.</p>

          <p>Tesla has applied for permits to test and deploy its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which already operates a well-established driverless service in the area. The move follows Tesla's recent pilot launch in Austin, Texas, where its vehicles operate with a human safety supervisor on board. While Tesla is seen as a pioneer, it is now playing catch-up to Waymo, employing a different technological approach that relies more on cameras than expensive lidar sensors. The expansion comes as Tesla's initial Austin pilot has faced some documented issues, including a minor accident and traffic violations captured on camera.</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a boom in demand, with treatments rising nearly 50% between 2018 and 2022. This trend reflects a shift in attitudes, as more individuals and couples turn to technologies like IVF and egg-freezing to plan their families amid social and financial pressures that lead many to delay parenthood. The government has expanded subsidies for these treatments in an effort to address the country's demographic crisis. This rise in fertility treatments contributed to a slight increase in the nation's birth rate in 2024, the first in nine years.</p>
