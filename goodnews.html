          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:03:04 EDT</div>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are distinguishing themselves from other carriers by leveraging their extensive networks and focusing on premium and international travel. Despite a general decline in airfare and weaker domestic demand, these two airlines captured over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts suggest their strategy of catering to high-value customers and expanding international routes provides a resilient buffer against market challenges. Both airlines are also innovating with cabin segmentation to further enhance revenue from their premium offerings, solidifying their market leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:56:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office has significantly reduced its spending on hotel accommodation for asylum seekers, reporting a 30% drop in the last fiscal year from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This cost-saving was primarily achieved by moving individuals into cheaper housing options, such as houses in multiple occupation, and by renegotiating government contracts. The department also increased the use of room sharing in the hotels that remain operational. However, migration experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse these savings and lead to a renewed reliance on costly hotels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in its stock price, analysts are defending Abbott Laboratories, with Jefferies upgrading the stock to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was triggered by a slight reduction in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and Abbott's CEO have called a "transitory" issue and an "overreaction." The primary headwind was a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business, particularly in China. Despite this, many analysts remain confident in the company's strong fundamentals and see potential for accelerated growth in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a landmark deal that provides it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The merger was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil development. Exxon, which leads the Guyana project, stated it disagrees with the ruling but will respect the outcome. The resolution removes significant market uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ether's price and the stocks of crypto-trading platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood surged following the passage of the GENIUS Act, the first major crypto regulation in the U.S. While Bitcoin's price remained stable, Ether saw significant gains, with its exchange-traded funds experiencing record inflows that surpassed those of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time. Analysts suggest this signals a potential shift in market leadership, driven by new legislative clarity and moves like BlackRock's filing to add staking to its Ether ETF. The new law is expected to provide a stable regulatory framework for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that consumer fears about high inflation are receding, with outlooks returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped significantly from 5% to 4.4%, while the five-year outlook also declined. Overall consumer sentiment ticked up slightly, suggesting a cautious optimism that the inflationary pressures from tariffs might be temporary. Despite the improvement, the report notes that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as expectations remain above their 2024 levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fourth and final detainee who escaped from an immigration detention center in New Jersey last month has been apprehended in Los Angeles. Andres Felipe Pineda Mogollon, a 25-year-old Colombian national, was arrested during a traffic stop, according to the FBI. He and three other men, described by DHS as "public safety threats," broke out of the privately-run Delaney Hall facility on June 12 by breaking through a wall. The other three escapees were captured within a week of the incident, concluding the manhunt for all four individuals.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old woman from Northamptonshire, England, discovered she had serious health conditions after a routine eye test revealed vision problems in her left eye. The optician's referral led to an MRI scan that identified a meningioma, a type of brain tumour, pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing four months later, doctors also discovered a nodule in her breast, which was diagnosed as breast cancer. After successful cancer treatment and her wedding, she underwent surgery to remove the non-cancerous brain tumour and is now raising awareness about the importance of regular health check-ups.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following an investigation into their recent Glastonbury festival performance. The inquiry was launched over comments made on stage, but police have now concluded there is "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction." The group, known for their pro-Palestinian stance and controversial messaging, called the investigation an act of "political policing intimidation." The decision closes one chapter of controversy for the band, though a separate police inquiry into another musical act at the festival is ongoing.</p>

The review praises the film for its eerily accurate depiction of how digital life bled into reality, creating a chaotic soundscape of noise and paranoia.

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering King Richard III's remains, claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Her new book argues that the princes were not murdered by their uncle, Richard III, but actually survived and lived out their lives. The decade-long "Missing Princes Project" she led reportedly found numerous pieces of documentary evidence supporting this thesis. This challenges the long-held narrative, popularized by Shakespeare and Tudor historians, that Richard III had his nephews killed to secure the crown for himself.</p>
