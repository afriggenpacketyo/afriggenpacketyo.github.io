          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on U.S. imports from the country. The agreement also reportedly involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. This move is part of a broader strategy by the administration to renegotiate trade relationships and impose higher tariffs on multiple countries to encourage new deals. The Japanese government has not yet publicly confirmed the details of the reported agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang have been hailed as England's new "super subs" following their pivotal roles in the Euro 2025 semi-final victory against Italy. Drawing comparisons to the impactful duo of Russo and Toone from Euro 2022, both Kelly and Agyemang came off the bench to change the game's trajectory. Agyemang scored a crucial late equalizer to force extra time, while Kelly secured the win with a dramatic 119th-minute goal. Their performances have sparked debate on whether they should start in the upcoming final.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. In return, the Philippines will reportedly eliminate its tariffs on U.S. goods, and Indonesia will drop tariffs on 99% of its trade with the U.S. These deals are part of the administration's push to secure new trade terms with various countries before an August 1 deadline, after which higher tariff rates could be imposed.

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back 250 years. Originally a Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. Researchers used a combination of tree-ring dating on its oak timbers and archival records to confirm its identity. The discovery, sparked by a local schoolboy, has become a community-driven archaeological project to preserve the island's maritime heritage.</p>

This is not the first time Kennedy's preference for exercising in denim has been noted. The CDC, which is part of his own department, recommends wearing loose, lightweight clothing in extreme heat to prevent heat-related illness.</p>
