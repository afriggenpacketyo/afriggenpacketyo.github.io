        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that for the Democratic party to regain power, it must support a new generation of progressive leaders who are not funded by corporate interests. The author contends that voters are disaffected with the current establishment and that robust primary challenges against incumbent corporate Democrats are necessary to inspire the electorate. The article suggests that true victory lies not in silence or compromise with powerful lobbies, but in courageously confronting them with bold, people-powered campaigns. The path forward requires leaders who are willing to fight for ambitious solutions like universal healthcare and higher taxes on the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Following the destruction of artist-activist John Outterbridge's Altadena home and studio in a January fire, his daughter Tami has launched a project called "Diggin' Bridge" to salvage his legacy from the ashes. With the help of her father's friends and fellow artists, she is leading an excavation of the property to recover artifacts and create new works inspired by the found materials. The community effort has unearthed significant items, including pieces by Outterbridge, his wife's wedding ring, and a long-lost work by artist Curtis Tann. This project serves as both a physical reclamation and a tribute to Outterbridge's spirit of transforming discarded items into something new.</p>

          <p>A new 12-part documentary series, "Rebel Architects: From Venice to the World Stage," explores the influential group of Los Angeles architects, including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne, who challenged conventions in the 1980s. The series uses a 1980 group portrait on Venice Beach as a starting point, reuniting four of the original architects to discuss their early careers, the scrappy creative energy of the era, and their subsequent impact on global architecture. The conversations delve into themes of collaboration, competition, and the evolution of Los Angeles from a perceived cultural backwater to an architectural hub. The series aims to capture the human chemistry and legacy of their rebellious spirit.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, who create cinematics, trailers, and other narrative content, have voted to unionize with the Communications Workers of America. This move is part of a growing labor movement within the video game industry, driven by concerns over job insecurity, crunch hours, and workplace issues. The unionization effort was facilitated by a labor neutrality agreement with Blizzard's parent company, Microsoft, which allows workers to organize more easily without going through a formal NLRB election. This group joins nearly 3,000 other workers at Microsoft-owned studios who have unionized in recent years.</p>

          <p>AMC Networks is strategically casting well-known American actresses, including Alicia Silverstone and Brooke Shields, in new original series for its Acorn TV streaming service. The platform, which traditionally specializes in British and international dramas, aims to attract a wider North American audience by leaning into the mystery genre with familiar stars. Silverstone leads the new series "Irish Blood," while Shields will star in "You're Killing Me." This strategy is part of AMC's effort to accelerate subscriber growth for its most profitable niche service, believing that bigger talent can raise brand awareness while maintaining the platform's core appeal for "armchair travelers."</p>

          <p>A 500-year-old manuscript page signed by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés has been returned to Mexico by the FBI. The document, penned in 1527 and detailing payments for expeditions, is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993. The FBI's art crime team located the page in the U.S. after the Mexican government requested assistance in 2024. Due to the document changing hands multiple times, no one will be prosecuted for the theft, but the FBI has stated its commitment to recovering the other missing pages of protected cultural property.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Comparing Bitcoin and XRP as Potential Investments for August</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of Bitcoin and XRP for potential investors, weighing historical performance against long-term institutional adoption trends. Historically, August has been one of Bitcoin's worst-performing months, with negative average returns, suggesting a potential price dip. While XRP showed signs of decoupling from Bitcoin over the summer, the two cryptocurrencies typically have a high correlation, meaning an August downturn for Bitcoin could also affect XRP. The author concludes that despite the potential for a short-term dip, Bitcoin is the better long-term buy due to its significantly stronger and growing institutional adoption.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German football champion Bayern Munich has ended its commercial branding deal with "Visit Rwanda" following significant pressure from fans and human rights activists. The club cited a "strategic evolution" for the change, rather than directly addressing criticism over Rwanda's human rights record and its alleged role in the conflict in DR Congo. While the prominent jersey branding will cease, Bayern will maintain a relationship with the country through a partnership focused on developing its youth football academy in Kigali. Experts suggest the move was forced by public relations concerns and that strategic expansion into new markets remains a key driver for such club-nation partnerships.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Consensus Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps is a Realistic Health Target, Not 10,000</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the widely-promoted goal of 10,000 steps per day is not scientifically based and that a target of around 7,000 steps may be more realistic and beneficial for most people. A comprehensive review published in The Lancet Public Health found that taking 7,000 steps daily was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of dying compared to taking just 2,000. While more steps provide some additional benefit, researchers note diminishing returns beyond this range. The consensus underscores that even modest increases in daily steps can have a major positive impact on health, especially for those who are currently sedentary.</p>
