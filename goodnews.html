          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a stunning pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, outperforming championship contenders Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri. This marks Russell's first pole since June and the first for Mercedes in Singapore since 2018, providing a significant boost for the team. The result came as a surprise, shifting the weekend's focus from a potential third consecutive win for Verstappen to Russell's impressive performance. Despite brushing a wall during his first run in the final qualifying session, Russell managed to set the fastest lap and then improve upon it, securing the top spot for the race.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in at least 10 deaths, were sparked by demands for cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. The deal brokered by a delegation sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has led to the government accepting the protesters' key demands. Following the announcement, the alliance's leader urged demonstrators to disperse, bringing a peaceful resolution to the widespread civil unrest in the region's capital, Muzaffarabad.</p>

          <p>The Buffalo Bills NFL team has drawn backlash from its fanbase after publicly wishing "good luck" to the Toronto Blue Jays in their MLB postseason series against the New York Yankees. Many fans and sports commentators expressed their disapproval on social media, arguing that a New York-based team should support another New York team rather than a Canadian rival. The incident has reignited debates about Buffalo's place within the "New York sports" identity, given its geographical and cultural proximity to Toronto. The Blue Jays responded positively, sharing a photo of Bills quarterback Josh Allen wearing one of their jerseys.</p>

Ryan pays $850 for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the city's tallest residential towers. He contrasts his current lifestyle, which allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth, with the constant financial pressure and feeling of being stuck in "survival mode" he experienced in the United States.</p>

The massive tomb, belonging to a ruler of the 18th Dynasty, was discovered in 1799 but had been looted of its contents. A Japanese-led restoration project has carefully worked to preserve the tomb's structure and renovate the intricate paintings on its walls depicting the pharaoh and ancient gods. The reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the country's economy.</p>

          <p>In 1996, David Risher, now the CEO of Lyft, made the risky decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft to join a small online startup called Amazon. He was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's powerful vision, which included an obsession with the customer experience and an audacious prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Even Bill Gates called the move "the stupidest decision" he'd ever heard. However, Risher was compelled by the opportunity to be part of building a transformative company from its early stages, a decision that proved to be incredibly prescient.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new song, "Actually Romantic," has ignited widespread fan speculation that it is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The lyrics refer to another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie" and writes songs about hating her, which fans have connected to Charli XCX's track "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying her new album, Swift described the song as a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that the attention is flattering. While neither artist has confirmed the rumors, the new track has fueled discussions about a potential rivalry between the two stars.</p>

Irenic is calling on the company to improve its operating efficiency, enhance corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale. The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and a high customer retention rate, Workiva's lack of profitability and bloated expenses have caused its stock to trade at a discount.

As the only commercial enrichment facility in the U.S., it is crucial for filling the supply gap created by the upcoming ban on Russian uranium imports. The plant is increasing its capacity by 15% and is a candidate for a Department of Energy contract to expand further. However, the entire nuclear supply chain, particularly uranium conversion, faces bottlenecks that could challenge the ambitious goals for nuclear energy growth.</p>

Takaichi, a 64-year-old hard-line conservative and China hawk, is a protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Her victory over a more moderate candidate underscores a desire within the LDP to appeal to its conservative base following recent election losses. As leader, she will face immediate diplomatic and domestic challenges, including managing rising prices and strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance, while her conservative stance could complicate relations with neighboring Asian countries.</p>

Despite being told she was too young for concerns, she sought a risk assessment which led to a mammogram and a breast MRI, revealing two suspicious masses. The early-stage diagnosis, which came without any symptoms, allowed for successful treatment including a bilateral mastectomy and chemotherapy.

          <p>Renowned conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, adopted a plant-based diet approximately 50 years ago, a choice that was deeply intertwined with her life's work and personal health. She stopped eating meat after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the fear, pain, and death of an animal. Her decision was driven by ethical opposition to factory farming and concerns about the environmental damage caused by meat production. Goodall often spoke about feeling better and lighter after making the switch, encouraging others to consider the planetary and personal health benefits of reducing meat consumption.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the profound impact of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. Her work fundamentally changed how humans understand their relationship with the animal kingdom. The article highlights the pivotal moment in 1960 when she observed a wild chimpanzee, whom she named David Greybeard, making and using a tool—a behavior previously thought to be exclusive to humans. This discovery, and the gentle trust she built with the chimpanzees, forced a redefinition of what it means to be human and created a legacy of conservation and interspecies understanding that endures today.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that a prestigious college brand guarantees value is eroding, as families increasingly prioritize practical considerations like cost, career outcomes, and hands-on learning. With tuition prices soaring and a tough job market, parents are questioning the worth of a high-priced degree from a top-ranked school. This shift is reflected in application trends, with students casting a wider net beyond traditional elite institutions and considering a mix of public and private options. As a result, the college hierarchy is becoming more fluid, with schools like Northeastern University rising in prominence by focusing on delivering tangible results rather than just reputation.</p>
