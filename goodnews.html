          <p>Shares of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, increased by over 4% following reports of a potential deal to acquire a $2 billion stake in the prediction market platform Polymarket. This investment would reportedly value Polymarket at between $8 billion and $10 billion. The move highlights the growing mainstream acceptance of prediction markets, which allow users to bet on the outcomes of real-world events. Polymarket recently received regulatory approval from the CFTC to launch its services in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in history, renewable energy sources like solar and wind have overtaken coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, according to data from the energy think tank Ember. The rapid growth in solar and wind capacity met all new global electricity demand, even contributing to a slight decrease in fossil fuel use. However, the progress is uneven, with developing nations like China leading the transition while some richer countries, including the US and EU, increased their reliance on fossil fuels. This milestone is considered a crucial turning point in the global energy transition.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully released 19 pine martens into Exmoor National Park, marking the species' return to the area for the first time in 100 years. The animals, which are native to the UK and play a crucial role in woodland ecosystems, were transported from the Scottish Highlands and fitted with radio collars for monitoring. This reintroduction, led by the Two Moors Pine Marten Project, follows a similar successful effort on Dartmoor. The project is seen as a positive step toward restoring natural balance and biodiversity in the region's woodlands.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As uncertainty grows regarding the United States' role in global leadership, key allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific are strengthening their own partnerships to address shared interests. Nations like the U.K., France, Germany, Japan, and Australia are coordinating on economic security, technology, and defense to shield themselves from pressures from both China and an increasingly protectionist U.S. This shift involves creating coalitions outside of U.S.-led frameworks, such as deepening ties through the CPTPP trade agreement and collaborating on defense projects. The goal is not to sever ties with Washington but to build resilience and contribute more meaningfully in a changing world order.</p>

          <p>Shares for the Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals saw a premarket surge of over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, from the Ambler mining district in Alaska. The move reverses a Biden-era rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to resource development, though the project faces opposition over potential harm to local wildlife and communities.

          <p>U.S. men's national team striker Folarin Balogun reflects on his difficult recovery from a dislocated shoulder and his return to form for both his club, AS Monaco, and the national team. He notes that new USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino allows for more attacking freedom compared to the previous system. Balogun, who scored in a recent victory over Japan, emphasizes the team's need for a momentum-shifting win against a top-tier opponent to build confidence ahead of the World Cup.

          <p>Firefighters in San Diego County successfully rescued a goat that became trapped between two large boulders after falling from a rock. The Cal Fire team used specialized pressurized air bags, capable of lifting up to 160,000 pounds, to carefully create enough space between the rocks for the animal to be freed. The goat, which tumbled about six feet, sustained only a minor injury and was happily reunited with its owners. The rescue highlighted the diverse skills of the firefighting crew, who are trained for complex search and rescue operations beyond just extinguishing fires.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law requiring streaming services like Netflix and Hulu to ensure their commercials are not significantly louder than the programs they accompany. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, extends the principles of the federal CALM Act, which already regulates commercial volume on broadcast and cable television but did not previously apply to streaming platforms. The law was prompted by numerous consumer complaints about jarringly loud advertisements interrupting shows and movies. It remains unclear how the state will enforce the new regulations on the global streaming giants.</p>

          <p>California has achieved a series of legal victories against the Trump administration, with Attorney General Rob Bonta's office successfully challenging numerous federal policies. A recent significant win includes a federal judge blocking the deployment of the California National Guard to Portland, Oregon. Since the start of Trump's second term, California has filed 42 lawsuits against the administration, winning in approximately 80% of the cases, which has restored billions in funding and slowed controversial policies. Bonta emphasizes that despite concerns about the administration ignoring courts, the legal system is largely holding and providing an effective check on executive power.</p>

          <p>A couple in New Orleans discovered a roughly 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker while clearing their yard, prompting an investigation into its origins. After consulting with university experts, the inscribed marble slab was identified as the headstone of a second-century Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus. The relic was reported missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, which was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during World War II. The FBI's art crime team is now involved to facilitate the repatriation of the artifact back to Italy, though how it ended up in Louisiana remains a mystery.</p>
