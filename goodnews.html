          <p>AVZ Minerals, based in Perth, has put its arbitration case against the Democratic Republic of Congo on hold to facilitate discussions encouraged by the US government regarding the Manono lithium project. The US is supporting KoBold Metals, funded by tech billionaires, in its bid to acquire AVZ's stake in the project, with a pledge of US$1 billion for development. This move is aimed at countering China's Zijin Mining, which currently controls the northern section of the project after Congo revoked AVZ's rights in 2023. Washington's increasing efforts to secure critical minerals in Congo reflect a direct challenge to China's dominance in the region, as lithium and copper are vital for the global green energy transition.</p>
