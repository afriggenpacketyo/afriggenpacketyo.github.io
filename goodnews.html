        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the overuse and often meaningless nature of corporate buzzwords, arguing that they impede trust and create insecurity among employees. While proponents claim buzzwords foster inclusion, studies show jargon hinders communication. Gen Zers may cling to buzzwords due to a lack of workplace experience, and employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. The author suggests that buzzwords are metaphors used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and advocates for using clear, real-human-people words instead.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major review of the military, amidst concerns about a "new, dangerous era" with a malevolent Russia and a less eager White House to defend Europe. The review is expected to underline the importance of nuclear weapons and the UK's commitment to NATO, while emphasizing modernizing forces with drones and adapting existing kit. The government will stress a greater need for public participation in protecting the country, including British industry creating more defence kit and expanding cadet forces. The report also suggests a new civilian force to protect infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a mixed week, influenced by President Trump's comments on China and tariff developments. Despite a volatile week, the S&P 500 closed higher for the week and month, driven by strong earnings from Nvidia and Costco. Broadcom was trimmed to book profits, and GE Vernova was also downgraded but with an increased price target. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but concerns about future tariff impacts remain, and the Fed is taking a "cautious approach" to monetary policy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple rules for parenting, emphasizing intuition, cultural traditions, and individual children's interests. The advice includes following your instincts, not influencers; following your culture, not clickbait; following your kid, not the crowd; focusing on enjoyment, not development; and being your real self, not your ideal self. The psychiatrist suggests that prioritizing love, attention, and authentic emotions is more important than striving for perfection.</p>

She highlighted that her female-led sitcoms aimed to portray flawed women, a perspective that was less common in comedy at the time. She has since balanced multiple roles on various shows, ranging from executive producer to actor, writer, and director.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris, suggesting that recent rule changes aimed at restricting front wing flexing had little impact on McLaren's performance. The FIA introduced the changes after lobbying from Red Bull and Ferrari, hoping to curb McLaren's gains. Piastri's advantage over Verstappen was larger than previous races, indicating McLaren's strength on circuits with long, high-speed corners. Piastri stated that the rule change had limited impact on McLaren's preparation for the race.</p>
