        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are eagerly anticipating a total lunar eclipse this Sunday evening, an event that will transform the full Moon into a striking red "Blood Moon" as it passes through Earth's shadow. While the full eclipse phenomenon occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, optimal visibility in the UK will depend on local moonrise times, with eastern regions offering the best views. This celestial spectacle, caused by the Earth positioning itself directly between the Sun and Moon, allows sunlight to refract through our atmosphere, creating the distinctive reddish hue. This marks a notable astronomical event, with the last total lunar eclipse visible from the UK having occurred in 2022.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, lending his support to Mamdani's progressive campaign against perceived oligarchic influence. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, advocates for key policies such as rent freezes, increased affordable housing, and higher taxes for New York's wealthiest 1%, garnering strong backing from grassroots movements. Sanders criticized mainstream Democrats for their muted support, portraying the campaign as a crucial "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail" against powerful billionaire donors. Both leaders emphasized the importance of voter mobilization and providing legal representation for immigrant communities amidst ongoing political challenges.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans' offense delivered an overwhelming 59-20 victory against Georgia Southern, spearheaded by junior quarterback Jayden Maiava, who threw four touchdowns and achieved a career-high 412 passing yards. The team accumulated an impressive 755 total yards, their most in two decades, showcasing highly efficient play and a robust rushing attack. While the defense exhibited some vulnerabilities leading to big plays for the Eagles, the sheer offensive firepower ensured a comfortable win, allowing significant playing time for backups. Coach Lincoln Riley, despite the impressive statistics, emphasized that the team remains "a long ways off from our best," underscoring the continuous pursuit of improvement.</p>

          <p>A collaborative research team from the US and China has engineered an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots up to 1.5 meters into the air by harnessing the explosive energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. This ingenious technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, which causes water droplets on the surface to boil and form bubbles. Once these bubbles reach a critical size, they suddenly collapse, generating a powerful propulsive force. Scientists have demonstrated the ability to precisely control the light flow, dictating where these miniature jumpers launch and even enabling them to swim, opening new avenues for robotic locomotion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the U.S., including districts in New York, Florida, and Texas, are adopting Yondr locked magnetic pouches as a solution to enforce statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. This system requires students to secure their phones in a pouch that can only be unlocked at specific school exits, aiming to minimize distractions and cultivate a more engaged learning environment. While some students appreciate the reduced reliance on their devices, others voice skepticism or attempt to circumvent the system. The initiative reflects a growing consensus among educators regarding cellphones as a major classroom distraction, despite ongoing debates about implementation costs and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was given special baseball memorabilia after a home run ball hit by Harrison Bader was controversially taken from him by an adult woman during a Marlins game. Viral footage captured the ball landing near the boy, who initially received it from his father, only for a woman to confront the father, claim the ball as hers, and take it from the child. In response to the incident, a Marlins staffer promptly presented the boy with a gift bag of team swag, and he later had the memorable opportunity to meet Bader, who personally gave him an autographed baseball bat. This gesture aimed to transform a disappointing experience into a positive one.</p>
