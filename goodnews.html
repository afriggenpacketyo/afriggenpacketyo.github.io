          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has stated he does not intend to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons, describing the player's recent public trade request as "negotiation talk." The standoff emerged from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would make him the highest-paid defender in NFL history. Despite the public dispute, Jones expressed confidence that the situation will be resolved, drawing parallels to past contract negotiations with other star players. Parsons' teammates have publicly voiced their support for him.</p>

The statement follows reports that a temporary placard detailing Trump's two impeachments had been removed from the "American Presidency" exhibit in July. The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation and was not requested by any government officials.

Footage of the apparent test was aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the 98th anniversary of the People's Liberation Army. This exercise marks a significant milestone for the vessel, which is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology. The Fujian's successful deployment of this system is a key step before its expected entry into service later this year.</p>

Raleigh, North Carolina, ranked first, followed by Nashville, Tennessee, and Austin, Texas, while major hubs like New York and Los Angeles did not make the top 10. The study analyzed factors such as unemployment rates, labor force growth, and real per capita income. Researchers note that this trend indicates a shift in the geography of opportunity, where strong wages in more affordable cities can offer a better quality of life.</p>

          <h2>Divorce Attorneys Advise on Protecting Finances During a Rocky Marriage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For couples facing marital difficulties without a prenuptial agreement, divorce attorneys recommend two key strategies to protect personal finances. The first is to gather comprehensive information about all joint assets, liabilities, and accounts while access is still readily available. The second is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, attorneys suggest that proactively addressing these financial matters can provide security and prevent more significant conflicts later on.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Calming Phrases for Handling Children's Tantrums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific calming phrases to de-escalate children's tantrums. Instead of punitive language, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" can validate a child's emotions and help them feel safe. The approach emphasizes connection over control, reassuring the child that they are supported and that their emotions are acceptable, even if certain behaviors are not. This method aims to teach emotional regulation and build long-term trust and confidence.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly fast-tracking a plan to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in the UK. The initiative, which could be operational within weeks, may allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the country for free treatment. This move follows criticism from the Foreign Affairs Committee about the government's previous reluctance to support such evacuations. A charity that has already privately brought three Gazan children to the UK for treatment has welcomed the plan and offered its expertise.</p>

          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area on Saturday night. This is the second seismic event to strike the state in less than two weeks, though it is still considered relatively weak and unlikely to cause significant damage. Officials reported no immediate damage but warned residents about the possibility of aftershocks in the coming days. While not a seismic hotspot, northern New Jersey lies on the Ramapo Fault line, which produces several small quakes annually.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement is inspiring a growing number of people to pursue early retirement by adopting principles of extreme saving and mindful spending. Proponents, like blogger Mr. Money Mustache, advocate for saving and investing 25 times one's yearly expenses to live off a 4% annual withdrawal. The philosophy, popularized by the book "Your Money or Your Life," encourages individuals to redefine their relationship with money, focusing on what is truly "enough" to be happy. This approach prioritizes liberating time for personal passions over accumulating material wealth.</p>

          <p>NBA star Stephen Curry recently stated he does not know his exact net worth, a position financial planners say can be beneficial. Experts suggest that focusing on tangible financial goals and cash flow management is often more productive than obsessing over a net worth figure. Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes, prioritizes building a portfolio he is proud of rather than fixating on a number. Financial advisors agree that this mindset, which emphasizes aligning spending with personal values and achievable milestones, can lead to greater financial well-being and satisfaction.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's reluctance to release documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, several ongoing legal cases could force crucial information into the public domain. A public records lawsuit filed by Radar Online is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein investigation file. Separately, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to review whether more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser can be unsealed. These legal battles may succeed where political pressure for transparency has so far failed.</p>
