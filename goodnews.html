          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from an Orleans Parish prison in May, has been apprehended in Atlanta following a standoff with law enforcement. The multi-agency manhunt concluded when a SWAT team located Groves in the crawl space of a home. Officials highlighted that prison staffing shortages and significant design flaws in the facility, built in 2015, contributed to the mass escape. Groves, a convicted murderer, now faces additional charges related to his evasion of justice.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 15:21:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparison of borrowing costs for October reveals that a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is substantially cheaper than using a credit card. The average credit card interest rate currently stands at 22.25%, while the median HELOC rate is just 7.89%, making credit cards over 180% more expensive. While both have variable rates that may decrease with future Federal Reserve cuts, the significant initial gap maintains the HELOC's cost advantage. Furthermore, interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if used for qualifying home repairs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, will not participate in the upcoming friendly match against Wales due to a minor ankle injury sustained during a recent Bayern Munich game. While the team's record goalscorer is expected to recover in time for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia, his absence highlights England's reliance on him for goals. Manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed the news and stated that either Jordan Henderson, John Stones, or Declan Rice will captain the team in Kane's place, with Ollie Watkins and Marcus Rashford as potential replacements upfront.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's September meeting show that officials were nearly unanimous in their decision to lower interest rates but were split on how many more cuts would be needed by year's end. A slight majority of the Federal Open Market Committee favored two additional quarter-point cuts in 2025, citing increased downside risks to employment. However, some participants expressed caution, noting that financial conditions did not seem particularly restrictive, highlighting a range of views on the future path of monetary policy amid concerns about a weakening labor market.

          <p>In her first conference speech as party leader, Kemi Badenoch announced that a future Conservative government would abolish stamp duty on the purchase of primary residences in England and Northern Ireland. The surprise policy is intended to improve social mobility and make home ownership more accessible. Badenoch stated the estimated £9 billion annual cost would be funded through previously announced savings from welfare, foreign aid, and civil service cuts. The move sets a clear policy distinction from the Labour government ahead of future elections.</p>

          <p>Priscilla has been downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to Mexico's Pacific coast, according to the National Hurricane Center. With maximum sustained winds dropping to 70 mph, just below the Category 1 hurricane threshold, the storm is no longer expected to make landfall. However, a tropical storm watch remains in effect for parts of Baja California Sur, as Priscilla is generating large swells likely to cause life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding. The storm is forecast to continue weakening over the next two days.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) have decreased but remain elevated compared to historical lows. With more cuts anticipated this year, savers may want to lock in current rates, which are still significantly higher than those for traditional savings accounts. Good rates can still be found, particularly for short-term CDs, with online banks often offering the most competitive returns. For example, current top rates range from around 4.30% for a 6-month CD to 4.00% for a 5-year CD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices hitting a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, some top financial advisors maintain that stocks remain a superior long-term investment. Pat Beaird of Beaird Harris Wealth Management notes that while gold glitters during periods of turmoil, earnings from equities compound over time, providing more reliable returns. Historical data supports this, with the S&P 500's annualized total return over 30 years at 10.67%, compared to 7.96% for gold. Equities are also seen as a better hedge against inflation because they generate earnings and pay dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

He criticized the media's demand for "overnight success" and affirmed that the club would not be run on "knee-jerk reactions," signaling a commitment to providing the manager with an extended period to implement his vision.</p>

          <p>For homeowners aged 62 and older on fixed incomes, a single-purpose reverse mortgage offers a targeted way to access home equity for a specific, pre-approved expense like property taxes or essential home repairs. Unlike more common reverse mortgages, these loans are typically offered by state or local agencies and come with lower costs and fees. Borrowers make no monthly payments, and the loan is repaid only when the home is sold or the owner moves out. However, availability is limited and applicants must often meet specific income qualifications. (not investment advice)</p>

With current global emissions pledges falling far short of the 1.5C target, the piece contends that the presence of world leaders is crucial for securing a more ambitious deal. It urges Starmer to resist reported pressure from aides to skip the event over fears of a domestic political backlash, and instead to reaffirm the UK's commitment to climate action on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Tori Dunlap, founder of Her First $100k, recently purchased her first home after years of advocating for renting as a wealth-building strategy. The 31-year-old multimillionaire explained that while renting provided the flexibility to travel and grow her business, she grew tired of the instability of landlords deciding her living situation. With her business and personal life now more settled, she prioritized the emotional desire for a stable home over a purely financial calculation, ultimately choosing to get a mortgage to maintain cash reserves for unforeseen expenses.</p>
