          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles, U.S. officials stated that the National Guard and Marines are deployed to protect federal buildings and personnel, operating under specific rules of force. These troops are not to engage crowds unless necessary, and their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition, though they will carry ammunition for self-defense. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done. The Los Angeles Police Department chief expressed concern about the lack of coordination, while a retired Air Force general questioned the use of military personnel alongside law enforcement. The article highlights the complexities of military deployment in civilian contexts. Optimism score must be based on a general scale of stability versus panic, panic being towards 0 and stability being towards 100.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK parliamentary report criticizes the country's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" and says it perpetuates outdated gender stereotypes. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more of average earnings and extending paternity leave to six weeks. Currently, eligible fathers receive ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower, which is less than 50% of the National Living Wage. The report also highlights the underutilization and complexity of shared parental leave, and the findings have been released on the eve of a dad strike advocating for parental leave policy changes. The article discusses the need for significant investment and reform in the UK's parental leave policies.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks. Teachers are advised to be transparent about their use of AI and always check its results, with the technology being used for low-stakes marking. The Department for Education says AI should only be used for low-stakes marking such as quizzes or homework, and teachers must check its results. Experts emphasize the importance of teachers learning to use AI to support students effectively, while also warning about potential data breaches and errors.

          <p>A North Korean Choi-Hyun class frigate, which partially sunk during a launch ceremony attended by Kim Jong Un, is now in a dry dock for repairs. Satellite images reveal structural damage to the ship's superstructure and potential damage to machinery and electronics from seawater flooding. Despite initial reports suggesting minimal damage, the extent of the repairs needed makes it unlikely the ship will be fully restored by the end of June. The article speculates on potential assistance from China or Russia, given the complexity of the repairs and North Korea's limited resources.</p>
