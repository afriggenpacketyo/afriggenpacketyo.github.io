          <p>Former First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children, displaced by the war, have been reunited with their families after she established an "open channel of communication" with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mrs. Trump stated that she sent a "peace letter" to Putin, pleading for the protection of children, to which he responded in writing. The reunification was facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine, with the identities and circumstances of each child confirmed by the U.S. government. This development is part of her BE BEST initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defender Conor Bradley delivered a standout performance for Northern Ireland in their 2-0 World Cup qualifying win against Slovakia, earning praise as the "best player on the pitch." However, the 22-year-old captain received a yellow card during the match, resulting in a suspension for the upcoming crucial game against group favorites Germany. His absence is considered a significant blow for manager Michael O'Neill's side, as Bradley has been a talismanic figure for the team.

          <h2>FIFA Explores Regulatory Changes to Potentially Ban Domestic League Matches from Being Played Abroad</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 03:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World football's governing body, FIFA, is actively redrafting its regulations concerning domestic league games held in foreign countries and is seeking legal advice on whether a complete ban is feasible. The move comes after UEFA recently approved overseas matches for Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A, citing the current FIFA framework. FIFA aims to create a more robust rulebook to prevent a global "free-for-all" of leagues staging official games abroad, an issue that has become more prominent since the Premier League's failed "39th game" proposal in 2008. New regulations are anticipated to be ready by early next year.</p>

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are increasing their investment in Africa as part of Beijing's "health silk road" initiative, aiming to address the continent's reliance on imported medicines. Projects include a new insulin production plant in Nigeria and a facility in the Ivory Coast by Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical to manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. Africa currently imports approximately 70% of its essential medicines, and these Chinese-led projects are positioned to fill critical manufacturing gaps. The investments are driven by high demand for generic drugs and treatments for chronic illnesses across the continent.</p>
