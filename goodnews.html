          <p>The BBC has confirmed that it will not appeal Gerry Adams' libel case victory, where the former Sinn F√©in leader sued the corporation over a 2016 BBC Northern Ireland Spotlight story regarding the murder of British agent Denis Donaldson. Last month, a jury found that Adams was defamed by an anonymous contributor's allegation that he sanctioned the 2006 killing, awarding him ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages. The combined legal costs for both parties are estimated to be between ‚Ç¨3-5 million, marking a significant financial impact for the BBC.</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering changes to President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," with senators meeting to discuss proposed modifications to the House-approved package. Key areas of focus include SNAP, SALT deductions, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits. Changes to SNAP could lessen the burden on states, while the SALT deduction cap may be lowered from $40,000. Border funding and Medicaid changes are also under debate, with senators aiming to rein in government costs and put federal programs on a more sustainable fiscal path. The bill aims to be the biggest spending reduction in history.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta as part of a $14.3 billion investment deal, where Meta will acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup without voting power. Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, will take over as CEO of Scale AI. Wang stated that the decision to leave was a cost of the opportunity, and a small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta. Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is bolstering the company's AI efforts, and views Wang as well-suited to oversee AI initiatives deemed crucial for the company.</p>

          <p>Aiden Markram's unbeaten century has put South Africa within reach of a historic victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final. Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood's partnership gave Australia an advantage, but Markram's stellar performance shifted the momentum. Markram shared an unbroken 143-run partnership with Temba Bavuma, who played through a hamstring injury. South Africa requires 69 more runs to secure the win and end their wait for a major men's final victory, unless Australia's bowlers can produce a remarkable performance.</p>

          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multiyear media rights agreement to carry Friday night WNBA matchups on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show. The agreement comes after Ion has seen huge growth with the WNBA, as viewership grew 133% year over year and more than 23 million unique viewers tuned into the coverage. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said the partnership with Scripps has helped the league expand its reach and visibility. The WNBA signed an 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal last July, valued at about $200 million per year.</p>

While promising, these approaches require more trials to ensure safety and scalability, emphasizing the continued importance of human blood donations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's admission that his mass deportations are hurting farmers and the economy has revealed a political vulnerability. Vulnerable House Republicans are expressing concerns that deportations are targeting hard-working individuals, taking resources away from pursuing dangerous criminals. Trump's policies contradict the MAGA ideology that undocumented immigrants are taking jobs from Americans, as there is not a rush of Americans to fill the vacancies left by deported immigrants. Democrats are urged to engage on this issue and point out the flaws in the MAGA worldview.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, of Sonic Youth, has released "Bye Bye 25," a protest song inspired by the Trump administration's efforts to minimize certain terms from public life. The song highlights the dark absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, presenting a jumble of terms for listeners to reflect on. Gordon's approach avoids sloganeering and strident criticism, instead emphasizing the ridiculousness of banning words like "allergy" and "measles." The song reflects a broader trend of muted responses from the entertainment world to Trump's second term, contrasting with the more overt protest efforts during his initial rise to power.</p>
