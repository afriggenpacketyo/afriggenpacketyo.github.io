          <h2>TSA to Phase Out 'Shoes-Off' Policy for Standard Security Screening at U.S. Airports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:54:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly two-decade-old policy requiring passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes. According to an internal memo, the change is being rolled out at major airports and is expected to be implemented nationwide soon, aiming to speed up the screening process. This shift brings the general security line policy in line with the existing rules for TSA PreCheck members. Passengers who trigger alarms at security scanners will still be required to remove their footwear for additional inspection. The original mandate was established in 2006, years after the attempted 'shoe bomber' incident.</p>

          <h2>New Gene Therapy Injection Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:49:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking gene therapy has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial, with some participants regaining significant hearing within weeks of a single injection. The study, published in Nature Medicine, focused on individuals with hearing loss caused by a mutation in the OTOF gene. Researchers delivered a healthy copy of the gene into the inner ear, which restored the production of a key protein for transmitting sound signals to the brain. The treatment proved safe and effective, particularly in children, with one seven-year-old girl recovering nearly all of her hearing, offering hope for future genetic deafness treatments.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will resume and increase shipments of defensive weapons to Ukraine, just days after his administration confirmed a pause on some military aid. The decision comes amid Ukraine's ongoing war with Russia, with Trump stating that the country must be able to defend itself from being 'hit very hard.' This policy reversal followed recent calls between Trump and both the Ukrainian and Russian presidents, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Vladimir Putin. The Pentagon confirmed it is sending additional weapons to help secure a lasting peace and ensure the killing stops.</p>

          <p>Singapore is increasingly becoming a top choice for Chinese students pursuing higher education abroad, challenging the long-held dominance of the United States. Factors such as cultural similarities, safety concerns in the U.S., and a more welcoming diplomatic environment are driving this trend. Many Chinese students find Singapore's blend of Eastern and Western cultures, along with its high-quality universities, to be an attractive alternative for long-term career prospects. Industry experts predict a continued rise in applications to Singaporean institutions as Chinese families seek stable and comfortable environments for their children's overseas studies.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Moves to Permanently Curb 'Renoviction' Evictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to permanently amend its rules to protect tenants from 'renovictions,' where landlords evict renters under the guise of substantial remodels to bring in new tenants at higher rents. The new ordinance will prevent landlords from using renovations as a 'just cause' for eviction unless they have an official order from a government agency citing housing code violations. The city is also developing rules to ensure landlords provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate, necessary remodels. This move aims to close a loophole that tenant rights groups say has been widely exploited.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its post-pandemic economy and international image, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This major policy shift has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings, especially from European countries included in the new scheme. While tourism numbers have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels, the move is seen as a crucial step in making travel to China less cumbersome and more appealing for both tourists and business travelers.</p>

          <p>Caltech is severing ties with its online 'boot camp' partner, Simplilearn, after settling a class-action lawsuit that alleged the program misled students. The lawsuit claimed the cybersecurity course was misrepresented as having close ties to the prestigious university when, in reality, the connection was minimal and instructors were often unqualified. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to new transparency rules and will pay to refund tuition for hundreds of students. The case is a significant development in the scrutiny of partnerships between universities and for-profit online program managers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned its controversial plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force (RIF) that could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA now states that a department-wide RIF is 'off the table,' as hiring freezes, retirements, and normal attrition are on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year. The initial plan, which aimed to cut staffing to 2019 levels, had drawn sharp criticism. While the VA secretary framed the change as a result of improved efficiency, critics argue it reflects an unsustainable rate of employee departures.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has officially concluded that financier Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019. The review also found no evidence of a so-called 'client list' or any credible proof that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals, debunking widespread conspiracy theories. While confirming that Epstein victimized over 1,000 individuals, investigators stated they found no basis for pursuing charges against uncharged third parties. The findings were released in a memo, with the White House stating it is committed to transparency but will not release graphic material.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to the All-Star team for the 11th time in his career, this time as a 'Legend Pick' by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a complete surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery. While acknowledging he didn't 'deserve' the selection based on his 2025 performance, Kershaw called it a 'tremendous honor' and expressed gratitude for the recognition. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not press charges or issue fines against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, despite the event having been officially banned by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants, but the mayor and organizers still face potential investigation. The event drew a record crowd in defiance of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a key provision of the recently signed 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which sought to bar federal Medicaid funds from going to organizations that provide abortion services. Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit arguing the provision unconstitutionally singled them out to penalize them for legally providing abortion care. The group, which serves over a million Medicaid patients, warned that losing this funding would have devastating effects on their ability to provide non-abortion health services.</p>
