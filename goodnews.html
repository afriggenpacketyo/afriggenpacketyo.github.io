          <h2>China Announces Policy Easing Measures Amid Trade Concerns</h2>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, to bolster economic growth amidst trade tensions. The measures aim to increase liquidity and support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, with the intention of mitigating the impact of tariffs and boosting employment. However, some economists suggest that these measures may have limited impact on domestic credit demand, and new fiscal policy measures may be needed if economic deterioration continues. The article also mentions that the Chinese yuan has regained some ground after weakening earlier in the month. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a better-than-expected net profit for the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug, but subsequently lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to weaker-than-anticipated Wegovy sales. The Danish pharmaceutical giant's overall revenue met expectations, though Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst predictions, with the company now projecting sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. This adjustment comes amid high demand for GLP-1 weight loss treatments and increasing competition in the weight loss drug market, as other pharma firms develop potential new candidates. The article also mentions Eli Lilly lowering its full-year profit guidance.</p>

The article mentions that investors are also anticipating the Federal Reserve's rate decision. Bitcoin previously reached a record high in January due to optimism surrounding President Trump's pro-crypto stance, but has since faced price setbacks due to his tariff program.</p>

          <p>Arsenal faces Paris St-Germain in the Champions League semi-final second leg, aiming to overturn a 1-0 deficit, and Mikel Arteta plans to leverage "rage, anger, frustration" to fuel their performance. Thomas Partey's return to Arsenal's midfield could be a game-changer, while Ousmane Dembele's fitness remains a question mark for PSG. The tactical battle won by Luis Enrique in the first leg may swing in Arsenal's favor due to Arteta's mid-game adjustments, offering Arsenal supporters reasons for optimism despite historical challenges.</p>

One sex worker's testimony led to the imprisonment of a man abusing his daughter, while another reported a man showing child abuse photos, leading to his arrest. The Night Light team builds trust with the women, offering support and resources, and has facilitated numerous reports about dangerous men and at-risk youth.</p>

Through various symbolic gestures and agreements, the two nations have built deep political, economic, cultural, and military bonds, with remembrance of war's horrors serving as an integral part of their partnership.</p>
