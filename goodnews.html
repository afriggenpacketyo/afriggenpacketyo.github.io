          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a critical docking mechanism for external experiments, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. Lacking specialized tools for the unforeseen problem and operating under tight time constraints, the astronauts had to improvise a solution in real-time. They successfully collaborated with the ground control team to resolve the issue, showcasing their resourcefulness in a high-pressure environment.</p>

With the series already secured, Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, replacing James Lowe, while James Ryan comes into the second row for Ollie Chessum. The selection emphasizes cohesion, with eleven players starting all three Tests in the series. The bench features a six-two split between forwards and backs, including the versatile Ben Earl and Jac Morgan, as Farrell prioritizes winning the final match over rotating the squad for experience.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean jumped over 16% to a multi-year high following the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a rate seen as favorable for the industry. The stock surge was also fueled by a strong second-quarter performance, where operating profits reversed from a loss a year ago, and the announcement of new orders. Hanwha is expected to expand its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal's 15-year-old academy player, Max Dowman, has been a standout performer during the club's pre-season tour in Asia, generating significant excitement about his potential. The young attacking midfielder, who first trained with the senior team at 14, has made a notable impact in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle. His performance against Newcastle was particularly impressive, where he won a decisive penalty after a skillful dribble into the box. Manager Mikel Arteta praised the display as "special" and uncommon for a player of his age, highlighting the supportive environment that has enabled his rapid development.</p>

          <p>On the eve of the MLB trade deadline, the Los Angeles Dodgers participated in a three-team trade with the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays, acquiring prospects and depth players. The Dodgers received left-handed pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays, while sending minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. While Serwinowski is considered an intriguing addition, the move is viewed as a minor one for a team expected to be a major player at the deadline. The club is reportedly still actively pursuing significant upgrades for its bullpen and outfield.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade agreement setting a 15% tariff on South Korean exports, a reduction from the 25% previously threatened by President Trump. The deal includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S., though the two nations appear to interpret the terms of this investment differently. While U.S. officials claim 90% of the profits will go to the American people, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung framed it as a fund to help Korean companies expand into the U.S. market. Seoul successfully resisted U.S. pressure to open its protected agricultural markets for rice and beef.</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at the Archibald Prize, Australia's most renowned portrait competition. Her winning entry is a portrait of Aboriginal musician William Barton, which she painted using her fingers because a nerve injury made it difficult to hold a brush. Spirovski stated she was overjoyed by the public's selection, calling it a "beautiful reprieve and reward" after a difficult period. She created the portrait while listening to Barton's music, which inspired her to set aside her brush and work directly with the paint, a process she found almost painless and creatively liberating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law, AB 379, allows prosecutors the discretion to charge an offender with a felony on a first offense if they are at least three years older than the minor. This "wobbler" provision aims to target older predators while avoiding harsher charges for all younger offenders. The bill faced controversy and amendments after some Democrats raised concerns that it could be used to unfairly target minorities and that its loitering provision was too vague.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a statement released Wednesday, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. A source close to Harris indicated that while she seriously considered the run, she concluded she could have a greater impact on the national stage and that her heart wasn't in the gubernatorial race. This decision keeps the door open for a potential presidential run in 2028, though she has reportedly not yet decided on that possibility.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, but the risk for the United States has largely passed without major damage. The powerful quake generated waves that prompted initial warnings and evacuations in Hawaii and along the U.S. West Coast, but these were later downgraded to advisories and then canceled. While some minor flooding and small waves were observed, the worst-case scenarios were avoided. However, alerts and evacuations remained in effect for some coastal areas in South American countries like Chile, as the series of powerful waves continued to travel across the ocean.</p>

          <p>With the MLB trade deadline approaching, several contending teams made significant moves to strengthen their bullpens. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for two top prospects. In another major deal, the New York Mets bolstered their relief corps by trading for both Ryan Helsley from St. Louis and Tyler Rogers from San Francisco. In a rare occurrence, Tyler's identical twin brother, Taylor Rogers, was also traded on the same day, going from the Pirates to the Cincinnati Reds as part of a deal for third baseman Ke'Bryan Hayes.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's own owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter new runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive process of rerouting the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, avoid spiraling costs, and could be fully operational by 2035 for under £25 billion. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated third runway project, a move Arora praised as a common-sense approach.</p>
