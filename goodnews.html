          <p>A major power outage impacted southeastern France, causing disruptions at the Cannes Film Festival, as the festival prepared for its closing ceremony. About 160,000 households were affected after a high-voltage line fell, following a fire at an electrical substation near Cannes. The festival's main venue switched to an independent power supply, ensuring scheduled events continued. Police are investigating the possibility of arson as the cause of the initial fire, and traffic and train services were disrupted in Cannes and Antibes, with authorities urging caution during travel.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a global challenger in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative shoe aesthetic and timing, as it captured market share during periods of decline for Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas still hold a combined 58% of the global market, On's growth rate has outpaced both companies. However, On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty regarding tariffs, as 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing calls for police reform under Police Chief Brian O'Hara. O'Hara focuses on implementing changes to reduce crime and build community trust, acknowledging Floyd's death as an "open wound" in the city. While shootings are trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by officer shortages. O'Hara is working to restore pride in the profession, change the department's culture, adjust arrest tactics, and enhance community engagement and officer training, even as federal oversight ends.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office reports a record number of Americans applying for British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain, with over 6,000 applications in the year leading up to March. This surge is attributed to the polarized political climate in the US and an increasing number of inquiries from American immigration lawyers. While the UK government aims to reduce immigration, some applicants may qualify more swiftly based on their contributions. Most applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links, with language requirements also playing a role.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that America's next-generation fighter jets and "loyal wingmen" drones could help offset China's numerical advantage in military fleet size. The US Air Force is developing unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) as part of its collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program. These drones are designed to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. Ground testing has begun, with production expected in 2026, though China is also advancing in this area of military technology, narrowing the gap.</p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US have significantly decreased, reversing the pandemic-era spike and reaching levels comparable to pre-pandemic times. The FBI's 2023 crime report shows a nearly 12% decrease in murders year-over-year, with further declines in 2024. This decline is attributed to the easing of pandemic-related disruptions and government initiatives to stem violence. While challenges remain, including police killings and concerns about subway assaults in New York, overall crime trends indicate positive progress.</p>

          <p>Republicans pushed President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" through the House, facing criticism for procedural misdeeds similar to those they accused Democrats of in the past. The final text of the 1,100-page bill became public hours before the vote, and rules were waived to expedite the process. Despite internal misgivings, most Republicans ultimately voted for the bill, driven by a desire to deliver results and meet deadlines. The bill aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, but faces challenges in the Senate.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move, supported by investor Bill Ackman, aims to release the firms from conservatorship, potentially benefiting investors. Critics, like Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn it could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The firms were bailed out in 2008 and have been under federal conservatorship since, with a push for privatization brewing for years.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a significant milestone in underwater communication. The project, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system that maps signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement could pave the way for real-life use of long-range undersea messaging, with profound civilian and military applications.</p>
