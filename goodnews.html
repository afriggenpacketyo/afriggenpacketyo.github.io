          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 09:20:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that President Trump's tariffs have had only a marginal impact on prices for goods and services so far. While final demand goods prices rose, this was offset by a fall in services costs. Annually, the headline PPI increased by 2.3%, the lowest level since September 2024, providing a mixed signal for the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an unusual alliance, Amazon utilized a rocket from its direct competitor, SpaceX, to launch 24 of its Project Kuiper internet satellites into orbit. This collaboration is driven by Amazon's need to meet a Federal Communications Commission deadline requiring it to deploy half of its planned 3,000-satellite constellation by July 2026. The launch underscores the intense competition and massive investment in the satellite internet market, a key battleground between billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Amazon now has 78 Kuiper satellites in orbit as it races to catch up with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service.</p>

          <h2>British and Irish Lions Tour Seen as Potential Lifeline for Struggling Australian Rugby Union</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 09:07:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing British and Irish Lions rugby tour is being viewed as a crucial opportunity to revitalize rugby union in Australia, which has been struggling financially and losing popularity to rival sports like rugby league and Aussie Rules. Rugby Australia has faced significant financial losses and the collapse of a major team, the Melbourne Rebels. The tour, along with upcoming home World Cups in 2027 and 2029, is expected to generate massive revenue and reignite public interest. Stakeholders hope this 'golden decade' will showcase rugby's unique global appeal and help secure the sport's future in the country.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. A progressive with strong endorsements, her campaign focused on upholding democracy, immigrant rights, and protecting social programs. She will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in a special general election on September 23. The district is heavily Democratic, and while the seat won't decide control of the House, its likely return to Democratic hands will narrow the slim Republican majority.</p>

          <p>MiniMax, a prominent Chinese artificial intelligence startup, has confidentially filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. Backed by major tech conglomerates and praised by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as 'world-class,' the company is one of China's leading 'AI Tigers.' Founded in 2021, MiniMax is reportedly aiming to raise between US$510 million and US$637 million, although the final deal size could change. The move follows reports that its rival, Zhipu AI, is also considering a Hong Kong IPO, signaling a push by China's top AI firms to tap public markets.</p>

          <p>The influencer industry is facing a shift as economic turbulence and recession fears make both audiences and brands more cautious with their spending. Online creators are seeing a decline in brand deals and backlash from followers for content perceived as out-of-touch or overly luxurious. This has led to a pivot toward more relatable, value-oriented content focusing on underconsumption and financial savviness. Marketing experts suggest that while some influencers may struggle, those who can adapt and build genuine trust with their audience will be better positioned to survive the economic downturn.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, rose amid renewed investor optimism that key U.S. crypto legislation could pass this week. The market had briefly dipped after the House failed to advance two bills: the GENUIS Act for stablecoins and the broader CLARITY Act for market structure. However, President Trump indicated that several Republicans have reversed their opposition, boosting confidence that the bills will eventually pass. Analysts view the passage as a matter of 'when,' not 'if,' which could reduce market uncertainty and be a long-term positive for the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the pros and cons of purchasing physical gold from a retailer like Costco versus a specialized gold investment company. Costco offers convenience, a high level of trust, and typically lower markups, making it an accessible option for new investors. However, its downsides include limited product selection, a no-return policy, purchase limits, and no buyback program. In contrast, gold investment companies provide a wider range of products and strategies but may come with higher markups and the risk of sales pressure or fraud. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise savers on the differences between certificates of deposit (CDs) and money market accounts, especially in a shifting interest rate environment. CDs are ideal for goals with a fixed timeline, as they lock in a specific interest rate, protecting savers from potential rate drops but penalizing early withdrawals. Money market accounts offer more liquidity and are better for emergency funds, though their variable rates will fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and need for access to their funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the Tour de France are increasingly adopting heat training to enhance rider performance. This method involves deliberately raising an athlete's core body temperature through methods like intense exercise in warm clothing or post-training saunas. Sports scientists claim this stressor is highly effective, potentially more so than traditional altitude training, as it can increase blood volume and stimulate red blood cell formation. The practice, once considered unusual, is now a mainstream strategy for top teams seeking a competitive edge in the grueling race.</p>
