          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to advance a major Republican spending bill after a small group of conservative senators, who had previously opposed it, changed their votes. The holdouts claimed that negotiations with party leadership, which included promises for a future vote on a Medicaid-related amendment, made them more comfortable moving the legislation forward. Despite advancing the bill, some of the senators have not committed to supporting its final passage, and Democrats have initiated a lengthy procedural delay by requesting the entire 1,000-page bill be read aloud.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With England international Marc Guehi entering the final year of his Crystal Palace contract, Liverpool has emerged as a strong contender for his signature. The potential transfer hinges on several factors, including Crystal Palace's valuation, which was previously as high as ¬£65 million, and whether Liverpool sees the price as reasonable for a player who will be a free agent next year. Guehi's decision may also be influenced by his potential playing time at Liverpool, where he would compete with established center-backs, and how a move could impact his standing with the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made significant concessions on its proposed welfare reform bill following the threat of a large-scale rebellion from over 120 Labour backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that concerns raised by his colleagues led to a stronger, revised plan that is now better positioned to pass. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now likely support the bill.</p>

The liquid-fuel rocket, a joint development by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has been a cornerstone of Japan's space program. The H2A series is now being retired and replaced by the next-generation H3 rocket.

          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for modern California. The magnitude 6.8 quake revealed critical vulnerabilities in unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that persisted for decades and led to deaths in later temblors. While many cities eventually mandated retrofits, some still have not acted on known structural risks. The 1925 event also spurred Santa Barbara's architectural transformation into a uniform Spanish Colonial Revival style, a move that helped define the city's unique character.</p>
