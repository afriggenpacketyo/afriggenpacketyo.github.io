          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its key interest rate at 2.5%, an almost three-year low, in a widely anticipated decision. The move comes as the nation's economy faces challenges, including a minor contraction in the first quarter of the year due to weak construction and slowing export growth. South Korea also confronts potential economic pressure from the Trump administration's recent threat to impose 25% tariffs on all of its imports. The country's stock market saw a slight rise following the central bank's announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has announced it developed its own custom cooling hardware to manage the intense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI chips. As AI workloads require massive energy, traditional cooling methods were deemed insufficient for AWS's scale, prompting the creation of the "In-Row Heat Exchanger." This new hardware can be integrated into existing data centers, allowing AWS to deploy dense computing clusters based on Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs. The move reflects a broader trend of cloud giants building custom infrastructure to optimize performance.</p>
