          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. Judge Myong Joun determined that the administration's actions were unlawful, questioning the claim that the changes were for efficiency rather than to abolish the department outright. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to implement President Trump's executive order to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education. The Department of Education has announced it will immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.</p>

          <p>Hall of Famer Brian Urlacher reiterated his stance against transgender athletes in women's sports, calling it a matter of "common sense." He argues that there are biological differences that make it unfair for males to compete against females. Urlacher questioned why more girls and women are not speaking out, noting that those who do often face negative consequences. He also pointed out the irony of those who advocate for women's rights but not in the context of sports. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while ensuring the continued operation of a strategically important U.S. military base. Under the deal, the UK can lease Diego Garcia, the largest island, for at least 99 years, maintaining the military facility. The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands and questions about Britain's colonial legacy. While Mauritius hailed the deal as a victory, some Chagossians criticized it for not securing their right to return to their homeland. </p>

          <p>A proposed Muslim housing development in North Texas, known as EPIC City, is under investigation by the Department of Justice and state officials for potential religious discrimination. Governor Greg Abbott has accused the development of creating a "no-go zone" banning non-Muslims, though developers claim it will be an open community. The investigations stem from claims of discrimination against non-Muslims and potential violations of Texas consumer protection laws. The project aims to accommodate the growing Muslim population in North Texas with housing, a mosque, and other community facilities. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it is investigating the admissions system at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia, alleging discrimination against Asian American students. The investigation is based on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin. The administration has argued that the Supreme Court‚Äôs ban on affirmative action in college admissions should also apply to K-12 education. The school changed its admissions process in 2020 to diversify its student body, leading to a decrease in the percentage of Asian students. </p>
