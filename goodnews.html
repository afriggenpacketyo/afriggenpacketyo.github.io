        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance. The scheme addresses unfair discretionary commission arrangements between lenders and dealers, which led to customers overpaying for loans on an estimated 14 million agreements. While previous estimates were higher, the regulator now suggests the average payout will be around £700 per person, with the total compensation from lenders potentially reaching £8.2 billion. This move aims to provide fair redress to consumers who were given inaccurate information or locked into unfair contracts.</p>

The restaurant, famous for its plantain-based jibarito sandwiches, has become a local institution that transcends cultural boundaries through both its cuisine and its daily acts of generosity.

          <p>Prominent Chicago political figures gathered to celebrate the 84th birthday of legendary civil rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson at the Rainbow PUSH Coalition headquarters. Although the event was held in his honor, Jackson himself was unable to attend as he was hospitalized with a lung infection. His family expressed hope that he would be well enough to attend church services the following day. The celebration, attended by Mayor Brandon Johnson and Jackson's sons, served as a tribute to his enduring legacy and decades of activism, even as concerns for his health were noted.</p>

          <p>Author Morgan Housel argues that financial wealth is not a prerequisite for happiness, which is more closely tied to contentment and managed expectations. In an article discussing his book, he outlines five rules for a happier life, emphasizing the importance of appreciating ordinary beauty and recognizing that psychological wealth comes from wanting less, not having more. Housel suggests that true satisfaction is achieved when one feels nothing is missing, regardless of their income or lifestyle. He posits that happiness is ultimately the gap between one's expectations and their actual circumstances, a state accessible to anyone.</p>

          <p>The estate of Michael Bond and the producers of the Paddington films are taking legal action against the satirical puppet show "Spitting Image." The lawsuit, filed in the UK's High Court, cites copyright and design right concerns over a sketch that depicts the beloved children's character as a foul-mouthed podcast host who swears and discusses taking cocaine. This portrayal starkly contrasts with the gentle, well-mannered bear known to generations of fans. The legal challenge aims to protect the integrity of the Paddington character from what the creators see as an unauthorized and damaging parody.</p>
