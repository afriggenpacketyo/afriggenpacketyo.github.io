        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, asserting that U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, which is welcome news for the local economy. Nippon Steel's bid to acquire U.S. Steel had previously faced opposition from former President Biden, and the deal is currently undergoing another national security review. Trump stated that the partnership would generate at least 70,000 jobs and contribute $14 billion to the U.S. economy, although specifics of the agreement and ownership structure remain unclear. Shares of U.S. Steel experienced a significant surge following the announcement, and a rally is planned in Pittsburgh to celebrate the deal.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has overturned an executive order issued by Donald Trump that targeted the law firm Jenner & Block, suspending security clearances and restricting their access to government facilities. Trump's order accused the firm of engaging in activities that "undermine justice and the interests of the United States," specifically citing their employment of Andrew Weissmann, who worked on the Mueller investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the U.S. Constitution, mirroring a similar ruling against an executive order targeting law firm Perkins Coie. The judge stated that Trump's order targeted Jenner & Block because of the causes it champions and the clients it represents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a border official, new sanctions from the Trump Treasury Department are a "full-frontal assault" on the Cartel del Noreste (CDN), one of the deadliest cartels operating along the southern border. The sanctions target high-ranking CDN members, blocking their property and interests in the U.S., and aim to disrupt the cartel's ability to obtain drugs, money, and weapons. Despite reduced illegal crossings due to the Trump administration's border crackdown, cartels like CDN continue to pose a threat to American citizens, engaging in violence, intimidation, and fentanyl trafficking. The sanctions are expected to weaken the cartel by creating a power vacuum and causing infighting.</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, have announced their departure from the firm to start their own law firm.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, leading to difficulties in walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. The condition is often underdiagnosed and its symptoms can be mistaken for normal effects of aging, but early diagnosis and treatment, typically involving surgery to insert a shunt, can significantly improve symptoms. Physical therapy can also aid in improving gait stability, and while N.P.H. is rare, the risk increases with age, and the singer is undergoing physical therapy to recover.</p>
