          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region rose as investors evaluated China's August inflation data, which showed a consumer price drop of 0.4% year-over-year, slightly more than expected. Meanwhile, the producer price index fell by 2.9%, aligning with forecasts and showing improvement from the previous month's decline. Tech companies in Apple's supply chain, such as Foxconn and Samsung, saw their shares climb following the launch of new iPhone models. The positive market movement came as U.S. equity futures also edged higher ahead of key American inflation data releases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States Men's National Team delivered a much-improved performance, defeating a heavily rotated Japan side 2-0 in a friendly match in Columbus. Goals from Alejandro Zendejas and Folarin Balogun secured the win, lending credibility to coach Mauricio Pochettino's strategy of testing different players and formations ahead of the World Cup. The team deployed a 3-4-2-1 formation, giving opportunities to several players who are not regular starters but could play key roles. Despite some missed chances early on, the US maintained pressure and demonstrated greater comfort and confidence than in their recent loss to South Korea.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement aimed at restoring cooperation and relaunching inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal was announced following a meeting in Cairo between Iran's Foreign Minister and the IAEA Director General, Rafael Grossi, who called it "a step in the right direction." This development comes after Iran suspended cooperation with inspectors in July and amid efforts by European nations to reimpose UN sanctions due to non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. The agreement addresses Iran's security concerns while outlining technical requirements for renewed oversight.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that China's Greater Bay Area (GBA), encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, would be an ideal host for the 2036 Summer Olympics. The author argues that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would mitigate the immense economic burden typically associated with hosting the Games. By leveraging existing venues and utilizing innovative, temporary structures, the GBA could host a cost-effective and sustainable event. The article suggests that the area's robust infrastructure is uniquely capable of meeting logistical challenges, such as housing athletes close to their competition venues.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-emerged as a candidate for the team's postseason roster after a dominant rehabilitation start for the Triple-A Oklahoma City team. In the outing, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings, consistently throwing over 100 mph and striking out eight batters. This strong performance marks a significant turnaround from his previous rehab appearances and has prompted the Dodgers' management to reconsider his role for the playoffs. While a starting position is unlikely, manager Dave Roberts has stated that a spot in the bullpen is now a distinct possibility for the 23-year-old pitcher.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a congressional district in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the U.S. House to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor and former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in the reliably Democratic district. Key issues in the race included President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, a significant concern in a district where many residents are government employees. The Democratic National Committee framed the victory as part of a trend of their party overperforming in recent elections.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price surged over 28% in after-hours trading following the release of staggering forward-looking revenue projections that left financial analysts "blown away." Despite missing current quarterly earnings estimates, the company forecast that its cloud infrastructure business would grow from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year, eventually reaching $144 billion within six years. This explosive growth is driven by massive new contracts for artificial intelligence infrastructure, including a multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI. The company's contracted future revenue soared by 359% to $455 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test that can detect biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, a development that scientists hope could revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, is expected to improve diagnostic accuracy from the current 70% to over 90%. Over 1,000 people with suspected dementia will participate in the study across 20 NHS memory clinics to see how the test performs in a real-world clinical setting. If successful, this less invasive test could replace the need for expensive PET scans or painful lumbar punctures for a definitive diagnosis.</p>

The previous program was credited with helping to reduce poverty and improve financial stability for tens of thousands of families. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham stated the expansion will support the economy and provide financial relief, with one expert calling it a "model for the nation."</p>

The system's CEO, a former bus driver, prioritized listening to passenger feedback, which led to reinventing bus routes, improving frequency to every 15 minutes on key lines, and expanding service to seven days a week. These significant improvements were achieved without a budget increase. The success of Akron's model, which focuses on directly addressing the needs of its community, is being highlighted as a potential blueprint for other public transit systems.</p>

Since the 2022 invasion, most men aged 18 to 60 were barred from exiting, a measure intended to preserve manpower for the war effort. President Volodymyr Zelensky explained the change is aimed at preventing young men from losing their connection to Ukraine, as many families were previously sending their sons abroad just before they turned 18.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed scrapping the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via a simple tap. The plan would permit banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing consumer preference for contactless methods, it has raised concerns about fraud. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk by their security systems.</p>
