          <h2>UK Government Postpones Child Poverty Strategy Publication</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has delayed the release of its child poverty strategy, originally due in the spring, until later in the year, possibly coinciding with the autumn budget. The Child Poverty Taskforce, led by Liz Kendall and Bridget Phillipson, is still working on the strategy, considering measures like scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy preventing most families from claiming benefits for third or subsequent children. While some criticize the delay, others suggest it allows for a more substantive strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship, as the government claims to be committed to tackling the root causes of child poverty. The government says they will deliver fully-funded measures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of Japanese workers, particularly those in their 20s, are adopting the concept of "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike their parents' generation, who were known for unwavering loyalty and long hours, these young professionals clock in on time and leave promptly, showing little interest in promotions or performance-related bonuses. This shift in attitude is driven by a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations who often faced 'karoshi', or death by overwork. Restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic have also prompted some to question their priorities, with a new generation finding it difficult to accept the concept of lifetime commitment to one company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the New York Mets in a grueling 13-inning game, winning 7-5, but the victory came at a cost, as the team's pitching staff faced additional challenges. A rain delay limited Clayton Kershaw to just two innings, while the bullpen was forced to cover 11 innings, stretching the already shorthanded pitching staff. Despite holding a lead, closer Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth inning, but the Dodgers managed to rally in extra innings, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez delivering a crucial RBI double in the 13th. This hard-fought win could have future implications for a pitching staff already running on fumes, especially with a tough schedule ahead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan's representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening alignment with Beijing. This move follows South Africa's severing of formal ties with Taipei in 1998 during Nelson Mandela's administration. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing relations with Somaliland, Somalia's breakaway region. Taiwan's diminishing presence in Africa reflects a broader trend of African nations strengthening ties with Beijing due to robust economic relationships, leading them to avoid actions that might offend Beijing.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on consumers. This move comes amid criticism that the government has failed to curb the recent spike in rice prices, which has hurt households as inflation outpaces wage growth. The government is likely to commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution, with Rakuten Group Inc. expressing interest in participating. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kilograms in early May, roughly double last year's level.</p>

Businesses in Qatar are increasingly interested in using the yuan for trade and investment, leveraging Hong Kong's financial tools for settlement, payment, and hedging. This trend reflects a broader movement to diversify from the US dollar, spurred by the US' trade war and China's long-term strategy to mitigate risks and assert financial independence.

The film follows Agathe, a lonely clerk at Shakespeare and Company, who gets selected for the Jane Austen Residency, where she meets Oliver, the great-great-great-great-grandnephew of Jane Austen. The film is equally as romantic about literature, writing and poetry as it is about such mundane issues as matters of the flesh. The film has a salve-like quality to it.</p>

          <p>Supermarket operators in Japan are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with an alternative amid rising domestic rice prices. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a lower price compared to Japanese-grown rice, reflecting consumer interest in more affordable options. Other retailers, such as Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co., have also seen solid demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The average price of rice sold at Japanese supermarkets reached a record high in early May, partly due to a poor harvest in 2023.</p>

          <h2>Vapers Stockpile Ahead of Disposable Vape Ban in the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 23:04:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a ban on disposable vapes set to take effect on June 1, many vapers in the UK are stockpiling as many as they can before they become illegal to sell or supply. Concerns about the ban include the ease of use of disposable vapes, the taste of refillable vapes, and fears that some will return to smoking cigarettes. While disposable vapes are considered a healthier alternative to cigarettes, there are concerns that vaping provides a gateway into nicotine addiction, with disposable vapes enticing children and young people with their fruity flavors and cheap prices.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that the United States is increasingly acknowledging Japan's economic importance after holding another round of talks with U.S. Cabinet members. Akazawa reported "more frank and in-depth discussions" with U.S. officials and highlighted economic security issues as crucial in the tariff talks. This comes as Trump announced a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., suggesting approval of the deal. Japan continues to advocate for the removal of additional tariffs, but given the Trump administration's position, they may consider compromises to secure an early agreement.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is preparing to govern Lancashire County Council, having secured a significant majority in recent local elections. New councillors, many without prior political experience, attended an induction day to learn about their roles. The party aims to review the council's budget, reverse net-zero initiatives, and challenge diversity and inclusion policies. The council leader, Stephen Atkinson, emphasized the need for a balanced budget and addressing legacy issues.

          <p>Four partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are leaving the law firm after it struck a controversial deal with President Trump to avoid targeting by the federal government. The departures follow an executive order by Trump that sharply limited Paul Weiss's interactions with the government, which was later rescinded after the firm agreed to compromises. The deal proved controversial in the legal community, with some firms choosing to sue the administration instead. It's not clear if the four attorneys' departures from Paul Weiss are related to the firm's agreement with Mr. Trump.</p>

          <p>Tra'Von Johnson, a 22-year-old inmate who previously escaped from a Tangipahoa Parish jail, was recaptured after a second escape. Johnson, awaiting trial for his alleged role in a home invasion, escaped after inmates flooded a cell, allowing him and another inmate to open a back door to the jail yard. This marks Johnson's second escape, as he was previously among a group of inmates who broke through the jail's perimeter fence in May 2024. The sheriff's office has placed at least four individuals on administrative leave pending a full review.</p>

The band denied the offence, calling it "political policing" and "a carnival of distraction" away from Gaza. Speaking on stage, √ì hAnnaidh said the authorities were "trying to silence us before Glastonbury" and urged fans to be "on the right side of history." The gig culminated in rousing renditions of Kneecap songs Get Your Brits out and H.O.O.D.</p>
