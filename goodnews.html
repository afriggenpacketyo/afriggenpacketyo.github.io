          <h2>Rare Mineral Tellurium Restores Sight and Grants 'Super Vision' to Blind Animals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 00:00:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, successfully restoring sight in blind mice and a monkey, while also granting them the ability to see infrared light. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties, converting light into electrical energy. The nanowire implants made from tellurium act as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina, sending electrical signals to the brain, and this breakthrough holds significant promise for treating human blindness, offering a potential path to restore vision and even enhance it beyond normal human capabilities. The results of the study indicate a promising avenue for treating blindness in humans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China, which faces a rapidly aging population and shrinking workforce. The study indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers, challenging traditional expectations that place the primary burden of childcare on women. China's fertility rate has fallen to an estimated 1.1 children per woman, far below the replacement level, threatening economic stability and the country's ability to achieve high-income status, thus, the proposal aims to promote gender equality and encourage shared parental responsibilities.</p>

Founders argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and is often at odds with European values and regulations, and instead of increasing working hours, they emphasize the need for more funding and resources to foster innovation and sustainable growth. Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, and the younger generation prioritizes work-life balance, making it crucial for startups to offer a supportive and balanced environment.</p>

While the program aims to attract repeat tourists and donors to the "furusato nozei" system, some officials express skepticism about its novelty and effectiveness in fostering regional economic revitalization, and the government hopes to encourage people to live and work in multiple areas to facilitate the flow of city dwellers into rural regions.</p>
