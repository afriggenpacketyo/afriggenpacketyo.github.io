The justices unanimously overturned a lower court's decision rejecting a lawsuit by an Ohio woman who claimed she was denied a promotion because she is heterosexual. The case, which was sent back to lower courts, challenges the requirement that plaintiffs in reverse discrimination cases prove an employer has a history of discriminating against a majority group.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House to discuss trade, tariffs, and international tensions. The meeting marks their first in-person interaction since Merz's election as chancellor. Tariffs and trade are expected to be key topics, given Trump's upcoming 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union. Merz emphasized the importance of the alliance with America for Europe's security and prosperity. The meeting follows Trump's recent announcement of a travel ban on several countries.</p>
