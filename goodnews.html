          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "landmark peace deal" between Israel and Hamas, mediated by the US, which he hailed as a historic step toward Middle East peace. Global leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and UN Secretary-General António Guterres, have welcomed the breakthrough, describing it as a potential turning point. The initial phase of the agreement involves the release of all 20 remaining living hostages by Hamas and the beginning of Israeli troop withdrawal from most of Gaza. This diplomatic success aims to bring immediate relief to families and offers a new horizon of hope for the war-torn region, despite ongoing challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has commissioned a world-first thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, built by the China Three Gorges Corporation. Located in Gansu province, this innovative plant utilizes two towers to feed a single turbine system, a design unprecedented in concentrated solar power. Nearly 27,000 mirrors focus sunlight onto these 200-meter towers, which are spaced 1km apart, generating concentrated heat to melt and store salt at high temperatures. This stored energy then creates steam to drive turbines, ensuring continuous power even after sunset or on cloudy days, making it 25% more effective than single-tower designs.</p>

          <p>Citi Ventures, the venture capital arm of Citigroup, has invested in BVNK, a stablecoin infrastructure company, signaling Wall Street's increasing engagement with cryptocurrency and digital assets. BVNK's technology acts as a payment rail for global stablecoin transactions, facilitating money movement between fiat and digital currencies. The company's valuation has reportedly risen beyond $750 million, driven by demand in the U.S. due to a more favorable regulatory environment, including the recent GENIUS Act. This investment highlights stablecoins' potential for faster, cheaper cross-border payments, positioning major banks at the forefront of this technological shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a Gaza peace deal, two years after the conflict began. The agreement entails Hamas releasing all living hostages, likely starting Monday, and Israel withdrawing its troops from Gaza to an agreed line within 24 hours of approval. While the deal is welcomed by hostage families and Gaza residents, key unresolved issues remain, including Hamas's disarmament and the future governance of Gaza. Mediated by the US, Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, this initial breakthrough offers a significant step towards de-escalation, but long-term peace depends on further negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Norwegian Nobel committee, for the first time in 125 years, granted exclusive media access to its secret deliberations for the Nobel Peace Prize, set to be announced on Friday. The committee convenes to select a laureate based on Alfred Nobel's 1895 will, focusing on promoting fraternity, disarmament, or peace congresses. This year, the process is overshadowed by Donald Trump's vocal campaign for the award, with world leaders and his cabinet openly lobbying on his behalf. Despite the pressure, the committee emphasizes its commitment to principled choices, while experts note Trump's past actions, like withdrawing from international accords, make his candidacy unlikely for this year.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's brokering of a "first phase" peace plan between Israel and Hamas, involving hostage release and troop withdrawal, is hailed as his first real blow for Middle East peace. However, this initial agreement primarily resolves the hostage crisis, leaving core issues like Hamas's disarmament and future Gaza governance unaddressed. The article posits that Trump aims to leverage his personal influence and the parties' exhaustion to fully end the war, potentially through a visit to Israel. Despite its limitations, the deal marks a significant de-escalation, driven by presidential strong-arming and regional pressure, offering a potential formula for broader conflict resolution if Trump chooses to pursue it further.</p>
