        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly advanced a major Republican tax and spending package, championed by Donald Trump as the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The procedural vote succeeded after last-minute negotiations persuaded several conservative holdouts to flip their votes. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, and others secured promises for an amendment vote related to Medicaid, which made them more comfortable advancing the legislation. The bill, which extends tax cuts and boosts security spending, now faces a lengthy debate and amendment process before a final vote.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Morgan Stanley executive has suggested that the recent panic and sell-off in the U.S. bond market is an overblown reaction, potentially driven by inexperienced investors. Chief Investment Officer Jim Caron argued that concerns over the U.S. budget deficit, exacerbated by recent legislation, are not new information and should not undermine the fundamental perception of U.S. Treasury bonds as low-risk investments. He believes the market's unease following a spike in Treasury yields is not directly tied to the deficit talk, characterizing worried investors as mere "tourists in the market."

Buckley, Sr. rebuilt his fortune and established the family at a large estate in Sharon, Connecticut, which he named Great Elm. It was into this world of wealth, deep Catholic faith, and staunch anti-communist sentiment that William F. Buckley, Jr., the future leader of the modern conservative movement, was born.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," created a platform for conservative ideas and propelled figures like Ronald Reagan to power. Tanenhaus and former Speaker Newt Gingrich argue that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that paved the way for the modern Republican Party.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concessions were made after over 120 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the initial plans. The changes, which include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and commissioning a review of the benefit, have put the government in a better position to pass the legislation. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, averting a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

Actor David Corenswet, who takes on the role, emphasized that his character's core struggle is loneliness and a desire to be part of humanity.

Lotus had paused production in May due to supply chain issues related to U.S. tariffs, but is preparing to resume as those tariffs are reduced.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the goal is to work collaboratively with the industry rather than dictating prices.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, couples who are miserable in their relationships often answer "no" to four critical questions. These questions assess whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. They also probe whether a partner shows genuine curiosity about the other's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. Travers suggests that conflict is inevitable, but how it's handled and whether partners maintain intimacy through curiosity and mutual respect are key indicators of a relationship's health.</p>

          <p>This article argues that while statistics show Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, this "sex recession" is not due to a lack of interest. Instead, it reflects a generation that is politically reshaping the definitions of sex, gender, and relationships. Having grown up post-#MeToo and post-Roe, many young people are rejecting traditional expectations and are highly active in advocating for sexual and reproductive freedom. The author contends that Gen Z's approach to sex is more a form of progressive resistance against restrictive social and political forces than a retreat from intimacy.</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Data Shows 401(k) Balances Correlate with Income Levels</h2>

          <p>Newly released data from Vanguard shows a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, the median balance for workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment in boosting savings, as participants in such plans for over ten years have median balances about 60% higher than those who enrolled voluntarily. This demonstrates the powerful impact of consistent, automated saving over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Startup CEO Prioritizes Candidates Who Can Both Strategize and Execute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the startup Evvy, says the most important trait she looks for when hiring is the ability to both strategize and execute. She finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees implementation as outside their scope. At a startup, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, get into the details to find a solution, and then actively build and launch it. To assess this, she asks candidates to describe a problem they solved, listening for the level of detail in their process and their enthusiasm for both sides of the work.</p>
