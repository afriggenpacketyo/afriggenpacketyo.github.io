          <p>Jon Jones has retired from UFC, resulting in Tom Aspinall being upgraded to undisputed heavyweight champion. Dana White announced the decision, ending months of uncertainty in the heavyweight division, and Aspinall, the third Briton to become a UFC champion, expressed excitement about an active reign. Jones, considered one of the best mixed martial artists, had previously declined a fight with Aspinall, stating it wouldn't add to his legacy. Aspinall is expected to defend his title this summer or early autumn, likely against Ciryl Gane.</p>

          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German passports has doubled in 2024, driven by factors such as dual citizenship opportunities and political and economic conditions in Turkey. Germany's citizenship reforms, allowing dual citizenship, have incentivized migrants to seek German passports without relinquishing their Turkish citizenship. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to the trend, as individuals seek greater stability and opportunities in Germany. While many integrated Turks appreciate the benefits of German citizenship, some still feel rooted in Turkish culture and consider Turkey their true home.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer using a non-invasive method. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine samples, and a survey using the test kits detected tumors and precancerous cells among residents of Hokkaido towns. The test kit could be vital in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. The researchers' model mirrors the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine, where balance between yin and yang is essential for health and harmony. This approach provides a new understanding of metabolic phases in one of the smallest model organisms used in molecular life mechanism studies.</p>
