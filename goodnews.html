          <p>Researchers have sequenced the first complete genome from Egypt's Old Kingdom, revealing the life and ancestry of a potter who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The man's well-preserved remains, found buried in a ceramic pot, allowed scientists to determine he was about 64 years old, had brown hair and eyes, and stood 1.6 meters tall. Genetic analysis indicated his ancestry was 80% North African and 20% from the Fertile Crescent, providing direct evidence of population mixing during this critical period of Egyptian history.</p>

The fan, Dave McCaskill, reached over the wall for a fair ball during a recent game against the San Francisco Giants, leading to his ejection and a review that awarded the batter a double.

          <p>A Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a stowaway snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold as passengers were boarding. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene to remove the reptile, which was identified as a harmless 2-foot green tree snake. The snake catcher noted that if he had not captured it on the first attempt, the plane would have needed to be evacuated and taken apart. The snake is believed to have boarded in Brisbane inside passenger luggage.</p>

          <p>In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban. The court ruled that the 1849 law, which was functionally dormant for decades under Roe v. Wade, was superseded by a more recent 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers in the state, who had resumed services after a lower court's similar finding in 2023 but faced the threat of the old ban being reinstated.</p>

          <p>Amid growing cybersecurity concerns and a desire to diversify supply chains, Germany is reportedly turning to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, reducing its dependence on the dominant Chinese market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, reflecting a broader European trend. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on sourcing critical, high-risk components like software and chips from "non-red" supply chains, an area where Taiwan's advanced tech sector offers a key advantage.</p>

The decision was confirmed by the home affairs minister, who stated it was made after Ye released a song titled "Heil Hitler," which glorifies the Nazi leader. The minister emphasized that Australia would not "import hatred" and that Ye's history of offensive and antisemitic comments was a key factor. This is not the first time Australian officials have considered banning the artist over his controversial remarks.</p>
