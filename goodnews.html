          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump, alongside leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, signed a declaration in Sharm el-Sheikh to formalize a peace plan for Gaza. The agreement's first phase includes the release of the final 20 living Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for 250 Palestinian prisoners and over 1,700 detainees. Trump celebrated the moment as a "historic milestone," stating that "the long and painful nightmare is finally over" for both Israelis and Palestinians. During the summit, Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi awarded Trump the Order of the Nile, Egypt's highest honor, for his role in brokering the deal.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has commented on the career of Marcus Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United. Tuchel praised the forward's immense talent and "unbelievable" quality but also issued a warning, urging him not to end his career with regrets about "what could have been." Rashford, who has had a mixed career trajectory and previously faced criticism for his attitude at Manchester United, has shown promising form in Spain. Tuchel emphasized that while Rashford's potential is limitless, he must consistently perform at a high level to be considered one of the world's best players.</p>

A search involving the Coast Guard by air and sea was launched immediately, and the individual was found and recovered just before 5:00 p.m. The rescue took place amid harsh storm conditions, with the area under a wind advisory for gusts up to 50 mph, making the operation particularly challenging.</p>

          <p>The pop-punk band Yellowcard is experiencing a career resurgence with their new album, "Better Days," which has achieved significant chart success nearly two decades after their peak. The band, which had previously disbanded in 2017, reunited and collaborated with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, who produced and played drums on the new record. The title track reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay chart, a milestone the band hadn't reached in 22 years. The members reflect on their journey, the initial struggles that led to their hiatus, and the renewed sense of gratitude and perspective they now bring to their music.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced its plan to hire 250,000 full-time and part-time seasonal workers to manage the anticipated increase in orders during the upcoming holiday season. This marks the third consecutive year the e-commerce giant has aimed for this level of seasonal hiring. The move comes as the overall forecast for seasonal retail jobs is expected to decline to its lowest point since 2009, according to analysis from Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Amazon stated that its seasonal positions will pay an average of over $19 per hour, providing a significant number of temporary employment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Shares of several quantum computing companies, including Arqit Quantum and D-Wave Quantum, experienced a significant rally after JPMorgan Chase identified the sector as a key investment area. The bank announced a new "Security and Resiliency Initiative," which includes a plan to invest up to $10 billion in industries critical to U.S. national and economic security, such as quantum computing. This endorsement from a major financial institution has fueled investor optimism in the burgeoning field. The move reflects growing interest from both the financial and technology sectors in the potential of quantum computing to solve complex problems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently brokered Gaza ceasefire has provided U.S. President Donald Trump with a significant diplomatic achievement, which he celebrated at a summit in Egypt with world leaders. This article analyzes the event as a "victory lap" for Trump, who has successfully ended a brutal two-year conflict and secured the release of hostages. While the deal has earned widespread praise, experts caution that the next phases, including Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's reconstruction, will be challenging and require sustained U.S. engagement. The long-term success of the peace plan may depend on resolving the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict and navigating complex regional politics.</p>

          <p>Alma Cocina Latina, a restaurant in Baltimore, is introducing diners to the unique and authentic flavors of Venezuelan cuisine through a concept its founder, Irena Stein, calls "culinary diplomacy." The restaurant's distinctive taste is rooted in specific Venezuelan peppers, such as ají dulce, which are not commonly available in the U.S. To ensure authenticity, the restaurant partners with a local farmer who specially grows these peppers, whose aroma is so evocative that it has moved the chefs to tears. The goal is to provide a cultural experience that exposes patrons to the rich history and migrations that have shaped Venezuelan food.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded on Monday, recovering some of the significant losses from the previous Friday, after President Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China. The market had plunged after Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on Chinese imports, but his subsequent social media posts suggesting "all will be fine" eased investor concerns about an escalating trade war. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq all saw gains, with chipmakers among the top performers. Analysts noted that while the immediate panic has subsided, the market remains sensitive to trade-related developments. (not investment advice)</p>
