          <p>Emma Raducanu triumphed over Ena Shibahara at the US Open, marking her first win at the tournament since her memorable 2021 title. Raducanu secured the victory in just 62 minutes, registering the quickest Grand Slam main-draw win of her career. Working with new coach Francisco Roig, Raducanu focused on her forehand returns and seemed to have developed a strong bond with her team. She also mentioned chiropractic Jerome Poupel, who previously worked with F1 drivers and racehorses, is part of her team. The tennis player joked about learning Spanish verb conjugations from Roig, highlighting the positive atmosphere within her team. The game's final score indicates a favorable outcome for Raducanu. </p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski refuted claims that his coaching decisions intentionally hindered Shedeur Sanders' performance in the preseason finale. Sports pundit Skip Bayless suggested Sanders was set up to fail due to playing with lower-string players. Stefanski dismissed these accusations, emphasizing his commitment to developing all rookies and highlighting Dillon Gabriel's progress. The coach said Sanders was kept out of the game's final minutes to provide more playing time for Tyler Huntley, indicating a strategic decision rather than sabotage. This decision has implications for the Browns' quarterback room as they approach the cut-down deadline. </p>

          <p>SpaceX is set to launch its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for a tenth test flight, aiming to evaluate several upgrades and push the vehicle's capabilities after previous failures. The flight plan includes the Super Heavy booster returning for a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship will attempt a suborbital trajectory ending in the Indian Ocean. SpaceX will conduct tests such as disabling an engine during landing and attempting an in-space engine restart. This test is critical for SpaceX's ambitions to launch Starlink satellites and eventually transport settlers to Mars, as well as for NASA's Artemis program which relies on Starship for lunar landings. There is a need to prove the reliability of the rocket in order for the program to be successful. </p>

He mentioned Russia's recognition of Ukraine's territorial integrity and the acknowledgment of security guarantees, while also stating that more sanctions against Russia are possible. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov affirmed Russia's respect for President Trump and desire for peace in Ukraine, blaming European leaders for hindering progress. Zelenskyy expressed skepticism about Russia's willingness to end the war, while NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte outlined a framework for security guarantees for Ukraine.

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform the asylum appeals system to reduce delays and reliance on asylum hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the creation of a new body of independent adjudicators to expedite appeals, aiming to resolve cases more quickly than the current court system. Ministers have pledged to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers, though 32,000 are still housed in them. The Refugee Council emphasized the importance of reducing errors in initial decisions to decrease the number of appeals. Protests have risen over asylum seeker housing, leading to multiple arrests and highlighting tensions surrounding the issue. </p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore criticized President Trump's approach to crime as "purely performative," after Trump offered to send troops to Baltimore. Moore touted Maryland's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime, noting a decrease in homicides in Baltimore. The governor invited Trump to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, but Trump responded by criticizing Moore's record on crime. The governor argues that the president's actions are performative without addressing the root causes of crime. </p>

          <p>Prageeta Sharma's poem, 'Irresistible Contentment,' explores the speaker's journey towards finding a place of golden silence and inner peace. The poem describes the speaker's struggle with language and the desire for speech to burn away the inauthentic. The journey involves replacing lesser feelings with stronger ones, reaching the poem's heart, and discovering a plateau of nested changes. The work captures the speaker's longing for something irresistible, perhaps new letters of gold, and is included in Sharma's new book, Onement Won. </p>
