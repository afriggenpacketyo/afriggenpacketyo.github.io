          <p>Intel announced third-quarter sales that surpassed analyst predictions, indicating a recovery in demand for its PC processors. This marks the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government acquired a 10% stake through an $8.9 billion investment, a transaction for which Intel is still seeking accounting guidance from the SEC. The chipmaker's results were also bolstered by a $5 billion investment from rival Nvidia, with whom it will collaborate on integrating CPUs with AI GPUs. Despite a slight decline in its foundry division sales, the company projects continued strong demand for its chips into the next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a significant single-day price drop, investors are evaluating the merits of buying gold from retailers like Costco. The article suggests that a temporary dip in gold's price generally presents a good buying opportunity, regardless of the seller, due to the metal's historical tendency to rebound. Purchasing from Costco offers accessibility and potential transparency compared to other vendors, though sales are final. While retailers provide a straightforward way to acquire physical bullion, specialized gold investing companies can offer a wider range of options, such as ETFs and IRAs, along with expert guidance.

          <p>Ford Motor Company reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, but the automaker lowered its full-year guidance for 2025. The revision is due to production disruptions caused by a fire at the plant of a key aluminum supplier, Novelis, which is expected to cost the company up to $2 billion. Ford plans to mitigate the impact by increasing truck production in 2026 once the supply chain stabilizes. Despite the setback, the company's Q3 revenue reached a record $50.5 billion, and it noted a smaller-than-expected impact from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan rates have fallen to an average of 8.11% for a five-year term, marking a near two-year low and presenting a potentially attractive borrowing option for homeowners. These rates are currently more cost-effective than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards, which have significantly higher interest rates. While the Federal Reserve is expected to make minor rate cuts later this year, the impact on home equity loans is predicted to be minimal, suggesting that waiting may not yield substantial savings. Homeowners are advised to consider locking in a fixed rate now to secure funds and avoid future market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

The book, which chronicles the author's journey of self-discovery with gender and sexuality, has become one of the most banned and challenged books in the U.S. amid a politically hostile climate toward the LGBTQ+ community. This new hardcover edition will include commentary from Kobabe, as well as contributions from other comic creators and scholars, offering deeper context on its themes and creation. Kobabe hopes the new edition will provide a richer text for fans, educators, and new readers.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a large number of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, showing more enthusiasm for him than for former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom's approval rating in the state is positive, California voters overall are more divided on a potential presidential bid. The poll also found that Californians view their state as a good example for the nation on technology and culture, but not on housing, taxes, or economic policy. This sentiment reflects widespread concern over the state's high cost of living.</p>

          <p>Average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage have dropped for the second consecutive week to 6.19%, nearing a three-year low and offering a potential opening for prospective homebuyers. While rates are trending downward, experts advise that future declines are likely to be gradual, and various economic factors could cause them to reverse course. Acting now could allow buyers to avoid the increased competition expected during the traditional spring homebuying season, especially if rates fall further by then. Buyers are encouraged to weigh the benefits of the current lower rates against the possibility of future market shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent sharp swings in the price of gold, driven by factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and stock market performance, are creating opportunities for nimble investors. One strategy is to trade the stocks of gold mining companies, which often move with greater leverage than the commodity itself. Another approach involves using gold-backed ETFs or futures for short-term plays that mirror the metal's spot price with high liquidity. For long-term investors, buying physical gold during price dips remains a viable strategy to hedge against economic uncertainty, though it involves additional costs for storage and security.

The U.S. government views leadership in quantum computing as a national security imperative to stay ahead of China.

          <p>Parenting toddlers can be challenging due to their rapidly changing emotions and defiant behaviors, such as constantly saying "no" or claiming everything as "mine." According to child development experts, these actions are a normal and necessary part of a child's journey to establish their own identity and independence. Understanding that this boundary-pushing is a form of social and emotional learning can help parents respond more strategically and with less frustration. The article offers tips for handling these situations, such as modeling calm responses and offering limited, positive choices to give toddlers a sense of agency.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market is experiencing unprecedented concentration, with a small number of mega-cap technology stocks now comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500 Index. This has led investors to seek out uncorrelated assets to hedge against volatility and portfolio risk. According to ETF flow data, cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies have become popular choices for diversification. While allocations to alternatives like gold and crypto are still relatively small, typically 1-7% of a portfolio, their adoption by mainstream investors is growing as a direct response to the imbalance in traditional equity markets.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to "surge" federal forces into San Francisco after receiving phone calls from prominent tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump stated that the CEOs and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie convinced him that the city was making "substantial progress" on crime. The decision is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who had advocated for partnership with federal agencies rather than a military-style presence. The reversal came after Benioff initially supported and then, after public criticism, opposed the deployment.</p>
