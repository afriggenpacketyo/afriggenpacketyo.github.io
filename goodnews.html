          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed high praise for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) during a visit to Taiwan, endorsing its stock as a "very smart" investment. His remarks coincided with ongoing discussions about the U.S. administration potentially acquiring equity stakes in chip companies, especially those receiving CHIPS Act funding, like TSMC. Huang highlighted TSMC's crucial role in developing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chips. Separately, he acknowledged China's security concerns regarding Nvidia's H20 chips, confirming a halt in production for some suppliers and expressing hope for a resolution to the trade tensions.

          <p>The U.S. real estate market is beginning to show indications of a slight recovery, with existing home sales increasing by 2% in July and housing inventory reaching its highest point in five years. This expanded availability provides buyers with more choices and improved negotiation power, although homes are now taking a bit longer to sell. Despite a minimal rise in nationwide median prices, many large metropolitan areas, especially in the South and West, are experiencing price softening. Recent weeks have seen a slight decrease in mortgage rates, stimulating refinance activity, yet experts forecast rates will hover around 6.6% for the remainder of the year, with minor reductions anticipated in 2026.

          <p>Chinese authorities have unveiled new "Guidelines for Regulating Medical Science Self-Media Behaviour" aimed at curbing the spread of false and misleading medical information across social media and other unofficial online platforms. These regulations mandate more stringent requirements for healthcare professionals and related individuals who share medical science content, while also increasing the onus on platforms to verify account credentials and ensure content accuracy. The initiative seeks to clearly delineate between authentic public health education and concealed commercial advertising, responding to concerns about the unchecked growth of unverified medical advice from various online health influencers.</p>

Couples, exemplified by Ellie and Brad who involved their sheepadoodle Newton as a ring bearer and guest greeter, emphasize the emotional comfort and happiness pets contribute to these significant events. This rising popularity has spurred the growth of specialized "dog chaperone" services, such as Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party. These companies help couples seamlessly integrate their dogs into the wedding day, providing everything from mini-grooming to managing their participation as "flower girls" or bridesmaids, often resulting in the canine companions becoming the unexpected stars of the celebration.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reaches Deal with EU, Reducing Pharma and Semiconductor Tariffs to 15%</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 03:23:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to reduce previously threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, settling on a 15% rate in a new trade deal. This decision follows Trump's earlier threats of tariffs as high as 250% on these sectors. Under the agreement, the U.S. will apply the 15% tariff on most European goods, including these key exports, from September 1. In return, the EU is expected to pass legislation eliminating tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including agricultural products, which would then trigger a reduction of the 27.5% tariff on European car exports to 15%.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Supreme Court has amended its previous order regarding stray dogs in New Delhi, now requiring that these animals be captured, sterilized, and immunized before being released, with exceptions only for rabid or aggressive individuals. Additionally, the court has banned public feeding of strays, directing municipal bodies to create specific feeding zones and threatening legal action against non-compliance. This revised directive comes after significant backlash from animal rights activists against the initial August 11 order, which had called for the removal of 5,000 dogs from high-risk areas due to a rise in dog bite cases. The court aims to centralize similar cases to develop a consistent national policy.</p>

          <p>Morecambe Football Club has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first professional English football club to be acquired by Sikh investors, Panjab Warriors, who subsequently appointed Ashvir Singh Johal as the inaugural Sikh manager of a British professional club. This groundbreaking development carries immense cultural and inspirational significance for the global Sikh community, including the estimated half a million Sikhs residing in the UK. The new ownership group intends to integrate Sikh principles such as discipline and compassion into the club's ethos, aiming to draw support from the Sikh diaspora worldwide. This event is celebrated as a vital advancement in enhancing Sikh visibility and representation within British football, a domain where the community has traditionally been underrepresented.</p>

          <p>A Bangkok court has acquitted former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of charges of insulting the monarchy, a verdict that could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The accusation originated from a 2015 interview where he implicated "some people in the palace" in the 2014 military coup. The court's decision hinged on a literal interpretation of Thailand's stringent lese majeste law, concluding that Thaksin did not explicitly name individuals protected by the statute. This acquittal offers a measure of relief to the influential Shinawatra family, whose political standing is currently precarious, with Thaksin's daughter, the suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn, also facing a critical Constitutional Court ruling.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing a major crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit while living abroad, projecting savings of £350 million over the next five years. Under the new regulations, claimants residing outside the UK for more than eight weeks will generally become ineligible, except in exceptional circumstances. A dedicated specialist team will leverage travel data to identify those no longer entitled to payments, building on a successful pilot that saved £17 million by halting incorrect benefits to 2,600 overseas claimants. This expanded effort, involving over 200 investigators, aims to curb benefit fraud and enhance public understanding of eligibility requirements.</p>

Wang reiterated China's steadfast support for Pakistan, aiming to bolster Islamabad's self-development capacity and its ability to withstand external pressures. In response, Pakistan's Prime Minister Sharif expressed keen interest in broadening collaboration to include aerospace, information technology, and infrastructure, while also assuring full commitment to safeguarding Chinese personnel and projects from terrorist threats. CPEC, a significant initiative with over $65 billion invested, strategically connects China's Xinjiang region to the Arabian Sea through Pakistan's Gwadar Port.</p>
