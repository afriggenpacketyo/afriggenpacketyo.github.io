          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of securing a €60 million (£51.8 million) deal for RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons, with the Netherlands international having completed his medical in England. The 22-year-old, a versatile player from Barcelona's La Masia academy, previously impressed during a loan spell at PSV and two seasons at Leipzig, contributing significantly with 22 goals and 24 assists. This potential transfer highlights Simons' status as one of Europe's most sought-after talents, following interest from other major clubs. His arrival would be a significant summer acquisition for Spurs, bolstering their attacking options.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England and Wales will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children from January next year, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months alongside the MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect children from severe complications of the varicella virus and is expected to save the UK an estimated £24 million annually in lost income and productivity. The decision follows a recommendation from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which addressed previous concerns about a potential increase in shingles cases, now considered minimal. This brings the UK in line with other countries like the US, where the jab has been available for decades, marking a significant public health advancement.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has rejected midfielder Kobbie Mainoo's request to go on loan, asserting their valuation of the player and desire for him to contend for a first-team spot. The 20-year-old, who has seen limited Premier League action despite a recent full EFL Cup appearance, is reportedly concerned about his game time as contract extension talks have stalled. Head coach Ruben Amorim views Mainoo as competing directly with captain Bruno Fernandes for an advanced midfield role, creating a challenging path for the young England international's immediate progress within the squad. This situation highlights the intense competition for places at a top-tier club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has substantially reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% to 1.4%, primarily attributing the revision to weaker expectations for pharmaceutical leader Novo Nordisk. The economy ministry cited a notable decline in Danish exports to the U.S. early this year, driven by inventory accumulation and heightened competition impacting Novo Nordisk's market share in weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The influence of generic medicines and U.S. tariffs also contributed to this downward adjustment. Despite the revised outlook, the ministry maintains that the overall economy remains robust, with high employment and inflation projected to stay below 2% annually, while the 2026 forecast was adjusted upwards.

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully reached a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels will remain available on YouTube TV. This deal averts a potential blackout that could have impacted millions of subscribers, particularly ahead of major sporting events like college football. Earlier, YouTube had expressed concerns over Fox's demands for significantly higher payments, but the companies ultimately settled on undisclosed financial terms. The resolution provides stability for YouTube TV's approximately 9.4 million subscribers and maintains Fox's presence on a leading streaming platform, despite Fox's recent launch of its own standalone streaming service.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first in seven years, suggests a potential easing of strained India-China relations. Despite deep historical suspicions and a widening trade deficit, both nations are facing pressures from US tariffs, prompting a reluctant move towards cooperation. Discussions are anticipated to cover trade imbalances and the diversification of supply chains, as India seeks to bolster its manufacturing capabilities while depending on China for crucial components. Although experts remain cautious about the longevity of any improved ties, the meeting could represent a significant step towards finding common ground between the two Asian giants.

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, is on track to conduct the first test launch of its Soyuz-5 rocket in December, with the aim of achieving full operational status by 2028. This medium-class launch vehicle, essentially a modernized version of the Zenit-2, is powered by the highly praised RD-171MV engines. The launch represents a significant undertaking for Roscosmos, which has contended with substantial funding shortfalls and the severance of ties with the European Space Agency following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Consequently, Roscosmos has relocated its launch operations to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome, leasing the facility until 2050, as it endeavors to redefine its space program.
