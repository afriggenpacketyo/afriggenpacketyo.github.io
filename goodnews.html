          <h2>Taiwan Downgrades Chiang Kai-shek's Mausoleum, Reflecting Shifting Political Landscape</h2>

          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified the mausoleums of Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, as "camp areas," signaling a move away from honoring the former Kuomintang leaders. This decision by the island's independence-leaning authorities represents a continued effort to diminish the legacy of Chiang Kai-shek. The revised guidelines reflect updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area, the military said in its announcement. This shift is part of a broader trend in Taiwan to grapple with and redefine its historical identity.</p>

          <p>China is set to release a movie this summer about the Imperial Japanese Army's Unit 731, a notorious biological warfare unit, raising concerns in Japan about the potential negative impact on bilateral ties. The film, produced with the cooperation of an exhibition hall dedicated to the unit in Harbin, is scheduled to be released on the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. The movie aims to reveal the crimes of Unit 731, which is believed to have conducted lethal experimentation on humans during World War II. The Japanese government fears the film could rekindle historical tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>WeightWatchers has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to eliminate $1.15 billion in debt and shift its focus toward telehealth services. The company has secured the support of most of its debt holders and anticipates a swift emergence from bankruptcy. This move comes as WeightWatchers transitions into the prescription drug weight loss business, particularly through the acquisition of Sequence. Despite a decline in overall revenue, the company's clinical subscription revenue from weight-loss medications has seen significant growth. The bankruptcy filing aims to strengthen the company's position in the evolving weight management market.</p>

          <p>Criminals who refuse to attend sentencing hearings in England and Wales may face an additional two years in prison under a new bill. The bill aims to ensure that offenders cannot "opt out" of justice, providing a moment of recognition and reparation for victims' families. The legislation was prompted by cases where the killers of loved ones did not attend their sentencing, causing further distress to the families. The new powers would apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior.</p>

The article highlights specific instances where lower-leverage relievers were used in key moments, resulting in runs for the Marlins. The Dodgers are trying to manage the bullpen's workload to ensure their most trusted arms are available for the long season.</p>
