          <p>A second U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 11, went overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea after an arrestment failure during landing; both pilots ejected and sustained minor injuries, while no flight deck personnel were harmed. This incident occurred just over a week after another similar event on the same carrier where a Super Hornet was lost while being towed in a hangar bay. The Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, including nine squadrons of Carrier Air Wing 1, three guided-missile destroyers, and the USS Gettysburg, remains fully mission-capable despite these incidents.</p>

          <p>Seagate is developing a 100-terabyte hard drive with a targeted launch by 2030, driven by strong demand from data centers supporting artificial intelligence. The company's chief commercial officer, BS Teh, emphasized that this significant capacity increase is crucial for meeting the storage needs of the growing AI industry. Seagate currently produces a 36-terabyte Exos M model, and sees the 100TB drive as a key enabler for delivering the storage capacity the market requires, as no other technology can currently match its potential.</p>

          <p>Caelan Doris's shoulder injury during Leinster's Champions Cup semi-final has cast doubt on his British and Irish Lions tour hopes, potentially clearing the path for Maro Itoje to captain the squad. Former Lions player Matt Dawson supports Itoje's candidacy, emphasizing that the captain must be a guaranteed team member, respected by teammates, and in top form, which Itoje has demonstrated this season for England. Shane Horgan agrees, highlighting Itoje's aura and the need for immediate respect within a Lions team comprised of players from different nations who have no prior relationship with each other.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy easing measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting 1000 billion yuan ($138.6 billion) into the market. These measures also include support for key sectors like technology and real estate, along with a 500-billion-yuan relending tool for consumption and elderly care, though some analysts believe the impact on domestic credit demand may be limited.</p>

Wegovy sales reached 17.36 billion Danish kroner, slightly below analyst expectations, amid high demand for GLP-1 weight loss treatments.

          <p>Bitcoin's value increased alongside Asian stocks following news of planned US-China trade talks, reflecting optimism that the world's largest economies might ease trade tensions. Digital-asset prime brokerage FalconX reported renewed interest in Bitcoin, and Sean McNulty noted that traders appear optimistic about the trade talks while largely ignoring the conflict in Pakistan. Investors are also closely watching the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision, with expectations of policymakers holding steady. While Bitcoin previously hit a record high due to optimism about President Trump's pro-crypto agenda, recent market turmoil has impacted crypto prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government is promoting a trade deal with Delhi as a boost to living standards, particularly for the North of England, the Midlands, and Scotland, but the deal is still under scrutiny and requires extensive review. A key point of contention is the agreement allowing Indian workers transferred to the UK and their employers to avoid paying national insurance in the UK for their first three years, drawing criticism from Conservative figures who deem it 'lop-sided.' Despite the domestic political reaction, the deal is viewed within the context of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States and the European Union, with progress expected soon, and presents an opportunity for the UK to leverage post-Brexit trade tools.</p>

Thomas Partey's return to midfield could prove decisive, and Mikel Arteta's tactical adjustments from the first leg may swing the match in Arsenal's favor.</p>

However, this position requires Morocco to balance economic opportunities with geopolitical risks, as tensions between China and the West intensify, potentially forcing Morocco to choose between its partnerships with China, the United States, and the European Union.</p>

The new measures could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who are removed from court for disruptive behavior, and offenders already facing whole life orders could be confined to their cells and stripped of privileges.</p>
