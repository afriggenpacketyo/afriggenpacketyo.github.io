          <p>Mondelez International, the maker of Oreo and Wheat Thins, has filed a lawsuit against Aldi, accusing the supermarket chain of copying its packaging designs to mislead customers. The lawsuit claims that Aldi's store-brand products, such as Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies and Thin Wheat, mimic the font, colors, and image placement of Mondelez's Nutter Butter and Wheat Thins. Mondelez seeks monetary damages and a court order to prevent Aldi from selling the allegedly infringing products. This isn't Aldi's first trademark lawsuit, as they previously lost a case in the UK over cider packaging similarities.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. by maintaining its advice that children may receive COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy had announced that COVID shots were being removed from the childhood vaccine schedule, but a memo sent by the CDC on Friday contradicted that statement. The CDC's updated guidance states that children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination based on the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and parental preference, but still broadly recommends COVID-19 vaccines for moderately or severely immunocompromised children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investors tracking gold prices should monitor key events in June, including an inflation reading on June 11 and a Federal Reserve meeting on June 18, both of which can influence gold prices. While gold prices have recently decreased from record highs, experts predict potential for another spike. Despite fluctuations, gold prices typically rise over time, making it a potentially valuable long-term investment. Cost-effective ways to invest in gold include fractional gold and dollar-cost averaging, but it is generally recommended to limit gold to 10% or less of an overall portfolio.

          <p>President Trump will hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh, following his announcement of a "partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are seeking clarity on the structure of the deal, which Trump described as involving a $14 billion investment by Nippon while maintaining U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick stated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" allowing it to influence board appointments and ensure production levels are maintained. The White House and the companies have provided limited details on the deal's structure since Trump's announcement.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a special government employee concludes. Musk stated that DOGE's mission to reduce wasteful spending will only strengthen over time, while Trump committed to making the cuts permanent. Despite a lofty promise of cutting $1 trillion, DOGE has reportedly saved roughly $170 billion, though some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion. Musk defended DOGE's work and said he expects it to achieve the $1 trillion goal eventually.</p>

          <p>The CDC has updated its COVID-19 vaccine guidance for children, now stating that those without underlying health conditions "may receive" the vaccine, shifting from a broad recommendation. This change follows an announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the agency's approach. The CDC's new guidance emphasizes shared clinical decision-making, meaning that vaccination decisions are made in consultation with healthcare providers and based on individual circumstances. The agency still recommends COVID-19 vaccines for immunocompromised children and most adults.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is departing from his official role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, but will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president. Musk's departure comes after serving for 130 days, the maximum allowed for his position. Despite leaving the administration, Musk will still be involved in advising Trump and could potentially attend White House meetings. The move comes after Musk expressed frustration about the President's policies.</p>
