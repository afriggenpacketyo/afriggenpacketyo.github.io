          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable oil reserves in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated a challenge from Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. While the acquisition is a major strategic win for Chevron, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess's operations, continuing its recent trend of workforce consolidation to improve efficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) present a secure savings option with returns currently outpacing the inflation rate. This article highlights that while national average yields are modest, top online banks offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs. Savers can lock in these high rates for a fixed term, benefiting from FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000, making CDs a powerful tool for preserving and growing purchasing power.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, current mortgage rates remain a significant factor amid a challenging housing market. As of mid-July 2025, average rates for 30-year mortgages hover around 6.70%, with 15-year loans offering slightly lower rates. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms by shopping around, and there is cautious optimism that rates may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes.

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will not pursue further action against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their controversial Glastonbury performance. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, authorities determined there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. The investigation, which the band labeled "political policing intimidation," was initiated over comments made on stage amid wider controversy surrounding the group's pro-Palestinian stance.</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching their highest point in over a decade, some investors may be tempted to shift their focus from the high-priced gold market. Silver offers similar portfolio protections like inflation hedging at a fraction of gold's cost, making it an accessible alternative. However, the article advises against a complete switch, suggesting that a balanced approach is more prudent and that investors should use the current price surges as an opportunity to reassess their overall precious metal allocations.

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-funded companies operating in Mexico will be excluded from the benefits of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) when it is reviewed next year. David Trujillo, a commercial counsellor, suggested that any revisions to the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting specific countries. This perspective comes amid ongoing US-China trade tensions, with the expectation that companies may need to source more components locally to qualify for preferential treatment.</p>
