          <p>Confectionery giant Mars has announced a strategic partnership with biotech firm Pairwise, leveraging CRISPR-based gene-editing technology to develop more resilient and sustainable cocoa plants. This collaboration provides Mars with access to Pairwise's Fulcrum platform, allowing for precise modifications to cacao traits that enhance resistance to diseases, heat, and other environmental stressors exacerbated by climate change. The initiative aims to safeguard the global chocolate supply, which is increasingly vulnerable to these climatic challenges. Gene editing offers a significantly faster and more accurate method for crop improvement compared to conventional breeding, promising a more secure and sustainable future for cacao cultivation and the broader industry.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Angels slugger Yoan Moncada was placed on MLB's restricted list, missing a recent game to undertake his U.S. Citizenship test. The 30-year-old Cuban native, who initially signed with the Boston Red Sox as a highly touted international free agent, has navigated a professional baseball career marked by both flashes of brilliance and periods of inconsistency since his 2016 MLB debut. Despite his long tenure in American baseball, Moncada has actively maintained his Cuban citizenship, notably representing his home country in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. His decision to pursue U.S. citizenship signifies a significant personal milestone, illustrating the profound life changes athletes often experience beyond their athletic pursuits.</p>

          <p>ESPN has finalized a five-year agreement to acquire the U.S. rights for WWE's premier live premium events, including WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, starting in 2026. The deal, reportedly valued at an average of $325 million annually, significantly increases the previous Peacock agreement of $180 million per year. All 10 annual WWE premium live events will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform, with select events simulcast on linear networks. This strategic partnership aims to expand ESPN's audience by tapping into WWE's younger, more diverse, and female viewership, further broadening the network's entertainment offerings beyond traditional sports.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to announce an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. This move comes as the tech giant faces pressure from President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs, which would significantly raise costs for its international supply chain. The White House views this as a win for American manufacturing and national security, aiming to reshore critical component production. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously warned about the financial impact of tariffs, prompting the company to expand its U.S. production and supply chain efforts, including a recent deal with MP Materials for rare earths.</p>

          <p>Award-winning climate journalist Alec Luhn, who had been reported missing after embarking on a solo hike on a Norwegian glacier, has been successfully located and found safe. His wife, Veronika Silchenko, confirmed his rescue, stating that he sustained a leg injury but is otherwise in good condition, expressing profound gratitude for the "miracle" and the efforts of all involved in the search. Luhn, based in London and known for his work with various prominent outlets, prompted a police search when he failed to appear for his flight back to the U.K. after his July 31st hike. This positive resolution brings immense relief and underscores the dangers inherent in solo outdoor adventures, even for experienced individuals.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs—three females and one male—recently made their public debut at Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic, marking a significant step in efforts to reintroduce the breed to its native habitat. This majestic subspecies, once prevalent in northern Africa, became extinct in the wild by the mid-1960s due to human activities. The cubs are part of an international endangered species program focused on maintaining genetic diversity in captivity, with plans for them to move to other participating zoos. While a full reintroduction is a "far distant future" goal, discussions with Moroccan authorities are underway, aiming to restore this iconic animal to its natural environment.</p>

          <p>Following the devastating Eaton fire in January that ravaged Altadena, turning lush landscapes into bare lots, resident Laurie Scott launched "Regrow Altadena," a free plant stand in her yard. Inspired by the solace a small houseplant brought her after losing part of her home, Scott began propagating cuttings and distributing plants, seeds, and soil to affected neighbors. The initiative has since given away over 1,000 plants and seeds, with community members contributing various greenery, pots, and expertise. This grassroots effort aims to provide hope, comfort, and a tangible vision of future growth for a community working to rebuild its connection to nature.</p>

          <p>Italy has granted final approval for the €13.5 billion Messina Bridge project, set to become the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily to the Calabria region. Despite being located in a seismically active area, designers claim the 3.3km bridge will withstand earthquakes. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed it as an "investment in Italy's present and future," with Transport Minister Matteo Salvini projecting 120,000 annual jobs and economic growth for the impoverished regions. However, the project, which has faced multiple past cancellations, still requires approval from auditors and environmental agencies, and continues to draw opposition over concerns about cost, environmental impact, potential mafia involvement, and local expropriations.</p>

Revenue climbed 31% year-over-year, accelerating from previous periods, and the company's CFO, Jeff Hoffmeister, noted that anticipated negative impacts from tariffs "did not materialize." This upbeat performance suggests Shopify is effectively navigating President Trump's trade policies, with no observed slowdown in U.S. demand. Gross merchandise sales also surpassed expectations, indicating robust consumer spending on the platform. The company attributes its success partly to significant investments in artificial intelligence tools, which are attracting and retaining a wider range of businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores whether annuities or Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are superior for retirement planning, concluding that both serve distinct purposes. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC-insured principal, making them ideal for short-term goals or conservative portfolio anchors, though their returns often lag inflation. Annuities, conversely, are designed for lifetime income, converting lump sums into guaranteed payments and mitigating longevity risk, especially valuable for those without pensions. However, annuities are more complex, with varying fees and limited liquidity. Many retirees find a combination of both—CDs for short-term safety and annuities for long-term income—offers the most comprehensive strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
