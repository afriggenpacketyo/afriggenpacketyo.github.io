          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital regulations for UBS that would require the bank to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. These measures aim to strengthen UBS's resilience and reduce the likelihood of government bailouts in future crises. UBS will also be required to fully capitalize its foreign units, potentially leading to fewer share buybacks. While UBS shares initially jumped following the announcement, the new regulations are expected to be fully implemented by 2034. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla stock experienced a rebound of approximately 4% following a significant drop attributed to the public argument between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

          <p>This article discusses current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates and strategies for savers to maximize their returns in an environment of persistent inflation. It highlights that leading CD accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate and allow investors to lock in high rates for the term of the CD, with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. The article provides a range of CD rates by term, including 6-month, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year options from various banks. It suggests considering online banks and short-term CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs offer higher interest rates than longer-term ones.

Crypto ETNs are debt instruments linked to cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure to digital tokens through regulated exchanges.

          <p>This article explores the evolution of teen movies and how they reflect societal anxieties about adolescence. From the rebellious teens of the 1950s to the stressed-out overachievers of the 21st century, teen movies have consistently captured the fears and fascinations of adults. The author examines films such as *Dazed and Confused*, *Fast Times at Ridgemont High*, and *Mean Girls* to illustrate how teen movies have both glamorized adolescent acting-out and grappled with serious issues such as drug use, teen pregnancy, and bullying. The article concludes by noting how the rise of social media has changed the landscape of teen culture, making it more difficult for adults to understand and control.</p>

          <p>The US economy experienced a slowdown in job growth in May, adding 139,000 jobs, as businesses grapple with uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade war. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, but federal employment declined due to cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge). The Bureau of Labor Statistics also revised down the number of jobs created in March and April. Economists anticipated a slump following earlier data suggesting a cooling job market.
