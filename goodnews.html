Head of the circus, Park Sae-hwan, expressed his commitment to preserving the legacy of Dongchoon, which once thrived with over 200 artists. Despite challenges from the rise of television, internet, and professional sports, Dongchoon has managed to survive and currently performs at a seaside tourist area in Ansan, drawing both older and younger audiences. </p>

          <p>According to a new report from Zillow, selecting specific interior paint colors can potentially increase a home's sale price. The survey of thousands of homebuyers revealed that olive green kitchens and classic navy bedrooms are most desired by buyers, who are willing to pay more for homes featuring these colors. Zillow found that a dark neutral color in the living room can boost a buyer's offer by about $2,600. Conversely, bright, playful colors may deter buyers and decrease a home's sale price. </p>
