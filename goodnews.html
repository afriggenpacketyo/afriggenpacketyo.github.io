          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by rising rice prices, marking the highest level since January 2023. The Bank of Japan is considering pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation climbed 3.6% from a year ago, remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates while monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, known as the 'Bagel Lady,' passed away at 87, leaving behind a legacy of transforming bagels into art and toys. In the early 1970s, she began painting smiling faces on bagels, turning them into necklaces and other creations. Her accidental bagel art career led to writing children's books and designing toys, including the popular Sweetie Pops dolls. Overcoming childhood illnesses, Blau found creative outlets in drawing and crafting, which later evolved into a successful career in art and toy design.</p>

Her stepfather, Peter Gregory Schuman, is also charged with conspiring with Brown in the fraud.

          <p>Amazon shareholders rejected a proposal to require the company's CEO and board chair roles to remain separate, with about 82% voting against the measure. The proposal aimed to codify the existing structure, where Jeff Bezos retained the title of executive chairman after Andy Jassy became CEO in 2021. While advocacy groups argued this split would improve corporate governance, Amazon urged shareholders to reject the proposal, stating the current policy allows the board to determine the right leadership structure for the company. Shareholder proposals seeking the separation of board chair and CEO roles have been on the rise in recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem is expected to announce a fall in domestic gas and electricity prices for millions of households from July, the first drop in a year.

Charities say cheaper bills would be welcome, but many people still struggle to pay, and millions of customers collectively owe about ¬£4bn to suppliers. Although the cap changes every three months, the regulator illustrates the effect of this with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.</p>
