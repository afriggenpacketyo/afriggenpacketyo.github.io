          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus but stranded in Earth orbit since 1972, is predicted to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry to occur within a given timeframe, but the exact location remains unknown. Despite the spacecraft's heat shield, some components are expected to survive the re-entry and impact the surface at high speed. If recovered, any surviving pieces legally belong to Russia. The article provides context on the spacecraft's mission, its current location, and potential impact scenarios.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., coinciding with the release of documents related to Adams's previously dropped federal corruption case.

          <p>President Trump indicated the U.S. may consider lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators. The conciliatory tone comes after Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliation from China. The article notes that investors are hoping for a reduction below 80%, and analysts suggest tariffs may ultimately settle around 34%.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British musicians and artists have signed a letter urging the Prime Minister to update copyright laws to protect them from artificial intelligence. They seek an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill requiring developers to be transparent about using copyrighted material to train AI models. The artists argue that failing to provide this protection would harm the UK's creative industries and its position as a creative powerhouse. A government spokesperson said they are consulting on measures that will work for both creative industries and AI companies.</p>
