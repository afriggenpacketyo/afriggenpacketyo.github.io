        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CrowdStrike shares experienced a decline in extended trading following the release of a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast, despite the company surpassing earnings expectations. For the fiscal first quarter, CrowdStrike reported adjusted earnings per share of 73 cents on revenue of $1.10 billion, in line with revenue expectations. The company's costs increased due to higher sales and marketing expenses, as well as increased research and development and administrative costs, partly due to a broad software outage from the previous summer. CrowdStrike has earmarked $1 billion for share buybacks and anticipates a free cash flow margin above 30% for the 2027 fiscal year. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Nvidia surpassed Microsoft in market capitalization, reclaiming its position as the most valuable publicly traded company for the first time since January. Shares of the artificial intelligence chipmaker rose approximately 3%, reaching $141.40, driven by sustained growth even amidst export control and tariff concerns. The company's market cap reached $3.45 trillion, slightly ahead of Microsoft's $3.44 trillion. Nvidia's resurgence has been a key driver in market trends, with other chip companies like Broadcom and Micron Technology also experiencing gains. The competition at the top of the market cap rankings highlights the dynamic nature of the tech industry. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been spared from US President Donald Trump's executive order that doubles steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The UK maintains the 25% tariff rate, dependent on compliance with the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8. Failure to comply with the EPD by July 9 could result in the UK levy rising to 50%. The UK government has affirmed its commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel. The exemption reflects ongoing trade negotiations and agreements between the US and the UK. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a key catalyst for the bank's stock. The Fed's decision reflects the progress Wells Fargo has made in addressing its deficiencies and fulfilling the conditions required for the removal of the growth restriction. The asset cap had prevented Wells Fargo from growing key lines of its business for years, and the removal now allows the firm to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. Wells Fargo shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield with a rare medical condition has been granted humanitarian protection from deportation, allowing her to continue receiving lifesaving treatment in the United States. The girl, identified as S.G.V., and her parents, who are from Mexico, originally received temporary permission to enter the U.S. legally in 2023. The Trump administration had rescinded the legal protections, but after public outcry and advocacy from lawmakers, the family's humanitarian parole was reinstated. The girl's doctor had stated that she could die within days of losing her medical care for short bowel syndrome. The decision ensures that S.G.V. can continue to receive the specialized treatment she needs. </p>
