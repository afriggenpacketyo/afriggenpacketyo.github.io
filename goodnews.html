          <p>Shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen for nine consecutive sessions, despite the company forecasting a nearly threefold increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. Analysts attribute the stock's retreat to profit-taking by investors after a massive surge since its listing, as well as a reset in market expectations. The company, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, contrasts with China's broader trend of tepid consumer spending on luxury goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Research indicates that some children possess a strong "food reward drive," making them more susceptible to overeating ultra-processed foods compared to their peers. Psychologists explain that these children struggle to regulate their intake of such foods, which are engineered for overconsumption, even when they are not hungry. Experts advise parents to create a safer home environment by limiting the availability and variety of ultra-processed items, rather than trying to teach moderation with foods designed to be irresistible.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg cautioned the Democratic party against aiming to merely restore the institutions and policies that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that the pre-2024 status quo was already failing many Americans and that Democrats must embrace fundamental change rather than just repairing what was broken. Buttigieg also discussed the public's loss of trust in government, citing the Jeffrey Epstein scandal as an example, and called for a "politics of courage" to counter fear.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has become the first U.S. state to require social media companies to display a warning label to users before they can log on, starting in July 2026. The law, signed by Governor Tim Walz, mandates a pop-up acknowledging that prolonged use can be hazardous to mental health, similar to warnings on tobacco or alcohol. While tech industry groups like NetChoice oppose the measure and may pursue legal action, supporters and mental health advocates believe the labels will encourage users, especially young people, to be more mindful of their online habits.</p>

          <p>U.S. chipmaker Nvidia was notably absent from China's largest annual AI conference in Shanghai, while domestic rival Huawei prominently displayed its Ascend AI chips and computing systems. This absence comes despite recent hopes that Nvidia could resume selling its less advanced H20 chips to China, highlighting the shifting dynamics under U.S. export restrictions. The event showcased a growing ecosystem of Chinese AI hardware and application developers, signaling an increasing self-reliance and a more competitive landscape for the American chip giant in the crucial Chinese market.</p>

          <p>England has called up all-rounder Jamie Overton to its cricket squad ahead of the fifth and final Test match against India at The Oval. The decision provides reinforcement for England's pace attack, which was heavily taxed during the previous match in Manchester. With a tight turnaround before the series-deciding game, captain Ben Stokes indicated a need for "fresh legs," making it possible that Overton could be one of several new bowlers to feature in the final lineup.</p>

          <p>Curators at the University of Cambridge's Fitzwilliam Museum have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian "soul house." The rare and exciting find was likely left by the potter who created the clay model offering before it was fired in a kiln. The artifact, dating to the Middle Kingdom period, will be a key feature in an upcoming exhibition, "Made in Ancient Egypt," which aims to shift focus from rulers to the ordinary craftspeople who created the objects.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have struck a last-minute framework deal on trade, establishing a 15% U.S. tariff on many major European exports, including cars, thereby avoiding a threatened 30% rate. In return, the EU is reportedly opening its markets to American exports at zero tariff and has committed to significant purchases of U.S. energy and arms. While the Trump administration hails it as a major victory, the deal provides some relief for Brussels by offering stability, though tariffs remain higher than before the trade dispute began.</p>
