          <p>Following a call with President Trump, the White House announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a future meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump has positioned himself as a mediator, suggesting he would join a trilateral summit to "close" a peace deal after the two leaders meet directly. This diplomatic effort comes amidst skepticism from some quarters, including Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who cautioned that any such summit must be prepared with extreme care. The article also briefly touches on Trump's unrelated call to end mail-in voting, a claim he has made without evidence.</p>

With 3,800 companies already established, the city is offering significant subsidies to attract more top-tier international and domestic firms. By 2030, Suzhou's ambitious goal is to host over 10,000 biopharma companies and generate an output exceeding 1 trillion yuan. This strategic push includes academic partnerships, such as the Academy of Pharmacy co-founded by Xian Jiaotong-Liverpool University, to cultivate the next generation of innovators in drug development.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus, identified by the James Webb Space Telescope. Designated S/2025 U1, the satellite is approximately six miles in diameter, making it one of the smallest of the planet's 29 known moons. Its small size is likely why it was missed by previous observations, including the Voyager 2 flyby in 1986. Researchers believe the discovery could hint at the existence of other small moons and provide further insight into the chaotic evolutionary history of Uranus's complex ring and moon system.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's commemoration of its victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression is not an exercise in cultivating hatred, but rather a necessary act of historical remembrance. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the Japanese military during the 1930s and 1940s is about truth and reflection, not vengeance. They draw a distinction between condemning Japan's wartime actions and appreciating modern Japanese culture, citing their own childhood filled with Japanese television and manga. The piece suggests one can condemn a nation's historical wrongs while embracing its contemporary people and culture.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are being sued in separate proposed class-action lawsuits for allegedly deceiving customers by selling "window" seats that are next to a blank wall. The lawsuits claim that on certain aircraft models, some seats in window rows lack an actual window due to the placement of internal components like air ducts. Passengers argue they paid extra for these seats for various reasons, including to alleviate a fear of flying or to look outside, and would not have purchased them if they had been properly informed. The suits seek millions in damages for potentially over a million passengers at each airline.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, with creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." The network allegedly consisted of tens of thousands of infected devices, such as routers and DVRs, and was used to conduct large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for hire. Prosecutors say the botnet was used to target victims in over 80 countries, including a U.S. government network and major tech companies. Law enforcement disrupted the attacks after executing a search warrant at Foltz's home as part of an international effort to dismantle DDoS-for-hire infrastructures.</p>

In the revamped, fast-paced format, the more experienced doubles play of Pegula and the aggressive net play of Draper proved too much for their opponents. The match pitted the two British No. 1s, Raducanu and Draper, against each other, with Draper showing no mercy in targeting his childhood acquaintance.

The company noted encouraging signs, including an increase in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. Home Depot's performance reflects its resilience while it awaits a broader pickup in home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has registered a local unit in Argentina with authorization to manufacture vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, signaling potential plans to establish a production facility in the country. This move would allow BYD to operate across the entire EV supply chain in South America's third-largest auto market. While no official plans have been announced, this follows BYD's regional expansion strategy and its 2017 investment in an electric bus plant in Argentina. If realized, this would be the company's second major vehicle factory in Latin America, following its large-scale project in Brazil.</p>
