          <p>Capital A, the parent company of Malaysian airline AirAsia, has confirmed it is in active discussions to purchase the C919 passenger jet from China's state-owned manufacturer, Comac. This potential deal would mark a significant breakthrough for the Chinese aircraft, making AirAsia the first foreign airline to formally work towards acquiring the jet. The C919 is designed to compete with the dominant Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 models in the single-aisle market. Interest in the aircraft is growing amid expanding economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

In the U.S., the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reached new closing highs, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined, weighed down by a drop in Apple shares. Futures indicate a higher open for Japan's Nikkei 225, while markets in Australia and Hong Kong are poised for a lower start as investors await key U.S. consumer inflation data.

He highlighted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and strong underwriting standards, despite it not yet being profitable. Cramer noted that while he prefers competitor Affirm, he believes Klarna's current valuation is not excessive and that its business model, which includes buy now, pay later services and budgeting tools, is robust.

          <p>The number of traditional "stand and stir" cooking shows commissioned on British television has plummeted, while food-related content booms on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. This article explores the cultural shift, arguing that online creators offer a speed, authenticity, and direct community engagement that traditional TV production cannot match. While popular competitions like 'The Great British Bake Off' still thrive due to their perceived authenticity, the broader genre is struggling to compete with the nimble and relatable style of internet food influencers who can respond to trends almost instantly.</p>

          <p>On the 30th anniversary of CNBC's "Squawk Box," host Jim Cramer reflected on the show's history and the evolution of market sentiment. He recalled the early days when the program helped "democratize" stock information, fostering widespread excitement among individual investors, a spirit he feels is returning to the current market. Cramer noted that after the dot-com bubble burst, many investors shifted to safer index funds. However, he now sees a renewed awareness that significant returns can be made from investing in single, high-performing stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A White House official has emphasized the need for the U.S. to defend its lead in artificial intelligence against rapid advancements from China. Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, stated that the gap between the two nations has closed significantly since 2020. He advocated for exporting cohesive "AI tech stacks"—which integrate chips, algorithms, and applications—to foreign partners. This strategy aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to strengthen the U.S. position in this critical technological race.</p>

          <p>Online real estate company Opendoor saw its stock jump 30% in after-hours trading following major leadership changes. The company appointed former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and named co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman of the board. These moves come after a period of intense pressure from investors, including Rabois, which led to the resignation of the previous CEO. Opendoor, which had faced the risk of being delisted earlier in the year, has recently attracted significant interest from retail investors, boosting its market capitalization dramatically.

          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their remarkable diversity, with over 100 known species displaying unique colors and mating dances. Scientists believe the key may lie in the spiders' "dark DNA," the non-gene portions of the genetic code whose function is largely unknown. These spiders have three times more dark DNA than humans, and it is hypothesized that this genetic material allows them to adapt and evolve into new species rapidly. The findings could provide broader insights into the evolutionary processes that create variation across the natural world.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has voted with bipartisan support to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq from 1991 and 2003. Lawmakers from both parties have argued that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military action without contemporary congressional approval. The measure, which passed 261 to 167, reflects a growing effort in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Similar efforts have previously passed in one chamber but failed to become law.</p>

Overall U.S. death rates were down for the third consecutive year, with heart disease and cancer remaining the top two causes.

For years, the agency argued that masks posed a heat exhaustion risk, a stance contrary to practices in other nations and recommendations from health agencies.

He also suggested his win demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for important issues. The ceremony also saw the finale of 'Gavin and Stacey' win for best comedy, and the animated series 'Wallace & Gromit' receive a special recognition award.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly became the world's wealthiest person, surpassing Elon Musk, after a significant surge in Oracle's stock price. The jump was driven by a highly optimistic outlook for the company's cloud infrastructure business and its success in securing major artificial intelligence deals. Ellison's net worth reached $393 billion before a slight dip in the stock price returned Musk to the top spot. The shift highlights the volatile nature of wealth tied to stock market performance, as Musk's fortune has been impacted by a decline in Tesla's share price this year.</p>
