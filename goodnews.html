          <p>BYD, along with other Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers like Zeekr and Deepal, are expanding into South Korea to boost growth and profits amidst intense competition in China. This move aims to enhance the global image of Chinese EVs, with BYD planning to double its showrooms in Korea by the end of 2025. The South Korean market, dominated by Hyundai and Kia, is seen as a crucial proving ground for Chinese EVs, offering a chance to demonstrate their design and manufacturing capabilities. BYD recently launched its Seal sedan in South Korea, competing with Kia's EV4 and Hyundai's Elantra, with a focus on ultra-fast charging technology and a long driving range.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have agreed to a trade deal that includes tariffs, signaling that President Trump intends to maintain tariffs as a key trade policy. The agreement allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, with higher duties for additional vehicles, while eliminating tariffs on British steel and aluminum. Trump indicated that the 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain for most trading partners, though some sector-specific deals might be negotiated. Analysts suggest the deal reflects the balanced trade relationship between the US and UK, but also highlights the potential for continued trade tensions and economic impacts.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden discussed Vice President Kamala Harris's 2024 election loss on "The View," attributing it to sexism and racism, while affirming their close relationship. Biden expressed hope that Harris would remain politically engaged despite her defeat, though he avoided specifics about her future plans, such as a potential gubernatorial run. He also mentioned that he is writing a book and considering his most significant role post-presidency. Some progressives criticized Biden for being in "denial" about his and Harris's viability as candidates, suggesting the party needs anti-establishment figures.</p>

The negotiations involved navigating between conventional trade negotiators and President Trump's unpredictable impulses, and Peter Mandelson played a key role in emphasizing technological collaboration between the two countries.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul is implementing a statewide ban on cellphones in K-12 schools during the school day to address concerns about student mental health and academic focus. Citing the addictive nature of social media and the constant notifications that distract students, Hochul aims to create an environment where kids can focus, engage, and interact face-to-face. The decision follows conversations with parents, teachers, and students who expressed concerns about the negative impacts of smartphones on learning and well-being. The new policy will take effect in the fall, with the goal of fostering a more connected and focused learning environment.</p>

          <p>Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, has pledged not to increase prices despite new tariffs on imports, a move that sets it apart from many businesses planning to pass on higher costs to consumers. The company has spent over a decade diversifying its supply chain to reduce dependence on any single country, particularly China. With plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, Keen is better positioned to absorb tariff impacts compared to competitors heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing. This strategy helps the company maintain competitive pricing while many footwear and apparel companies are expected to raise prices.</p>

          <p>Choosing the right karaoke song involves selecting a tune you love, know well, and can perform with confidence, according to karaoke enthusiasts. Crowd-pleasers that most people recognize are ideal, as they encourage audience participation and create a lively atmosphere. Knowing the melody and most of the lyrics is essential, and using body language to express the song's emotions enhances the performance. Ultimately, karaoke is about enjoying the music and connecting with the audience, rather than striving for perfection.</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges ruled that Alabama's redistricting plan intentionally discriminated against Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. The court found that the state legislature failed to create a new district that would give Black voters an opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. The ruling pointed out Alabama's history of defying federal court orders and expressed deep disturbance at the state's response. The plaintiffs are seeking federal preclearance for future congressional districting, underscoring the ongoing struggle for fair representation in the state.</p>

Based on a new Scalable Modular Architecture (SMA), the XC70 aims to cater to the growing demand for extended-range hybrids, and Volvo is considering launching it in other markets as well.
