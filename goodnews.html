          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a robust resurgence, driven by a significant influx of Chinese companies seeking listings, positioning the city to become the world's largest listing destination this year. New listing volumes in the first half of 2025 surged to $14 billion, an eightfold increase from the previous year, surpassing 2024's total. This revival is fueled by a combination of factors, including supportive regulatory policies from Beijing, a slower pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and concerns about delisting from U.S. exchanges. The trend is bolstered by mainland investors increasing their stakes in Hong Kong-listed shares, particularly those in emerging sectors like AI and renewable energy, as Chinese firms look to fund global expansion strategies.

          <p>A crucial section of a wing flap from a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-900 jet was unexpectedly discovered on a residential driveway in Raleigh, North Carolina, following the aircraft's safe landing at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration has confirmed that the part originated from Delta Flight No. 3247, which had departed from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. Remarkably, despite the detachment of this significant component, the aircraft, carrying six crew members and 109 passengers, completed its flight without any reported injuries. The FAA has launched an investigation to ascertain the circumstances under which the wing flap separated from the plane during its journey, with Delta Air Lines affirming its full cooperation in the ongoing safety inquiry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued a significant order, effectively blocking the Trump administration's controversial policy that sought to restrict migrants from seeking asylum upon crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss concluded in a 128-page ruling that President Trump had overstepped his legal authority, emphasizing that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an immigration system that bypasses existing congressional statutes. Although the Supreme Court recently curtailed judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions, Judge Moss explicitly stated that this particular case warranted such injunctive relief. The ruling, which also certified a class of all individuals impacted by Trump's executive order, has a 14-day stay to allow the administration time to prepare for an appeal and implement the court's directive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that a specific type of hormone therapy, specifically estrogen combined with progestin, may increase the risk of breast cancer in women under 55 who still possess a uterus. In contrast, the study found that estrogen-only therapy actually reduced breast cancer risk in women who had undergone a hysterectomy. This new research offers a more nuanced understanding compared to earlier studies from the 2000s, which were criticized for their design and primary focus on older women. Medical experts stress that while hormone replacement therapy remains a highly effective treatment for many perimenopausal symptoms, these latest findings highlight the critical importance of individualized medical consultation to assess risks and benefits, taking into account a woman's unique health profile and the presence or absence of her uterus.</p>

Despite enduring a well-documented history of substance abuse, numerous life-threatening accidents, and a Parkinson's diagnosis, the 76-year-old "Prince of Darkness" will reunite with his original Black Sabbath bandmates to headline an all-day stadium concert in his hometown of Birmingham. Titled "Back to the Beginning," the event will also feature an array of influential heavy metal groups, celebrating Black Sabbath's foundational impact on the genre and Osbourne's enduring image as rock's quintessential wild man. This concert represents a poignant farewell, as his health challenges increasingly necessitate a step back from the stage.</p>

This landmark deal, the culmination of a decade of negotiations, establishes a free trade area that encompasses nearly 300 million people and represents a combined gross domestic product exceeding $4.3 trillion. The agreement is designed to significantly boost bilateral trade by enhancing market access for over 97% of exports and eliminating customs duties between the blocs. Announced during a Mercosur summit, the deal now awaits parliamentary approval from all participating countries, building on a similar, though yet unratified, agreement previously struck between Mercosur and the wider European Union.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' ambitious pursuit of setting a new record for All-Star Game starters concluded with only three of their eight nominated finalists securing a spot in the National League lineup. While designated hitter Shohei Ohtani had already been confirmed as a starter due to leading Phase 1 votes, only catcher Will Smith and first baseman Freddie Freeman were additionally selected by fans in Phase 2. This result means the Dodgers did not surpass the standing record of five starters, previously achieved by teams such as the 1976 Cincinnati Reds. Despite this, the remaining five Dodgers finalists still have a chance to make the All-Star roster, as pitchers and reserves for the 32-man teams will be determined by a vote among MLB players and the commissioner's office.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is confronting substantial challenges in stabilizing government finances, particularly after planned welfare reforms, initially projected to save billions, were significantly curtailed. With her crucial ¬£10 billion fiscal buffer now severely diminished, Reeves is weighing five primary options to rectify the financial situation ahead of the upcoming Autumn Budget. These strategic choices include waiting for unexpected economic growth, identifying new savings despite recent departmental budget allocations, reconsidering her firmly stated commitment against altering self-imposed financial rules, adopting less frequent financial assessments by the Office for Budget Responsibility, or implementing tax increases/extending existing threshold freezes. The final option, while potentially unpopular with "working people," is widely viewed as a potent mechanism to replenish government coffers and effectively address the national deficit.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, stipulating that the United States will implement 20% tariffs on Vietnamese imports, a notable reduction from the initially threatened 46% levy. In exchange, Vietnam is set to grant the U.S. "TOTAL ACCESS" to its markets, allowing American products to be sold there at zero tariff. The deal also introduces a more substantial 40% tariff on goods identified as "trans-shipped" through Vietnam, addressing concerns that Chinese products were being rerouted to circumvent existing tariffs. While the agreement aims to foster reciprocity and open new markets, ambiguities persist regarding the precise definition and enforcement of "trans-shipping." Share prices of companies with manufacturing operations in Vietnam experienced initial gains following the news, reflecting the market's response to these new trade conditions.
