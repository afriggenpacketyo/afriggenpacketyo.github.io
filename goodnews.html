          <p>An employment tribunal in the United Kingdom has ruled that spending a limited amount of time on personal online browsing during work does not constitute a fireable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an administrator who was dismissed after her employer used spyware to track her activity on shopping and property websites. The ruling highlighted that the employee's personal usage was not excessive and that the company lacked a clear policy prohibiting it. The judge concluded the dismissal was unfairly motivated by the owner's desire to remove the employee before she accrued additional legal protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Four-time Super Bowl champion Rob Gronkowski believes that rookie quarterbacks are entering the NFL more prepared than ever before. He attributes this readiness to the advanced knowledge and coaching they receive at the college level, which allows them to quickly adapt to professional playbooks. Gronkowski noted that this is a significant shift from a decade ago, when young quarterbacks often required more development time. However, he also acknowledged the value of learning behind an established veteran, citing the situation of rookie Jaxson Dart, who will be backing up Russell Wilson, as a path that can be highly beneficial for a player's long-term career.</p>

Local businesses are hosting themed parties, and fans are traveling from afar, comparing the event's energy to Beatlemania. The tour is seen as a refreshing cultural moment, providing a rare spectacle of classic rock and roll camaraderie that offers a welcome distraction in a politically tense time.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has advanced to the US Open final, marking a remarkable comeback after a difficult experience at Wimbledon where she lost the final 6-0, 6-0. The 24-year-old has demonstrated significant mental fortitude and devastating offensive shotmaking throughout the tournament, defeating top players like Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka. Her journey reflects substantial personal growth, aided by a mental health break in 2023 and a newfound ability to maintain composure under pressure. She will now face world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka for the Grand Slam title on home soil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals further interest rate cuts, individuals with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) must reconsider their savings strategies to avoid locking in lower returns. With rates on new CDs declining, simply rolling over an existing account may not be the most profitable option. Financial experts suggest exploring alternatives such as high-yield savings accounts or money market accounts, which currently offer competitive, albeit variable, interest rates with greater flexibility. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD, which provides stability against future market declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock soared nearly 11% after the company announced strong quarterly results and revealed it has secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, widely believed to be OpenAI. CEO Hock Tan's upbeat forecast and the addition of a new client prompted analysts to significantly raise future earnings estimates. This dynamic means that despite the stock's sharp price increase, its valuation based on a price-to-earnings multiple has not become significantly more expensive. The company's backlog now exceeds $110 billion, signaling strong business visibility for the next two years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, narrowly outpacing Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Despite leading the session, Norris expressed that the competition was uncomfortably close, as the low-downforce Monza circuit does not favor the McLaren car as much as high-downforce tracks. His teammate Oscar Piastri finished fourth fastest in an impressive performance after sitting out the first practice session. The close times among McLaren, Ferrari, Williams, and Red Bull suggest a highly competitive qualifying session and race ahead this weekend.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has swelled to $1.8 billion, the second-largest in U.S. history, sparking a frenzy of ticket buying that is significantly boosting business for lottery courier services like Jackpocket, owned by DraftKings. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in Powerball ticket sales on its platform, which operates in 16 states. DraftKings acquired Jackpocket in 2024, viewing it as a key asset for cross-selling customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming products.

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw its most significant one-day drop in over a year, falling to 6.29% following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report. This sharp decline offers potential relief for homebuyers who have been facing rates in the high 6% range for months. For a buyer of a median-priced home, this drop could translate to a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this decrease will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty continue to sideline many potential buyers.

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean over the past month. The successful operation, dubbed "Pacific Viper," involved over a dozen interceptions that also led to the arrest of 36 suspected smugglers. This surge in counter-drug activity is part of a broader effort to disrupt cartel operations and trafficking routes from South America before illicit substances reach U.S. shores. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted by its crews.</p>

          <p>A new photograph captured by the Gemini Observatory in Chile shows the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The image reveals that the comet's coma and tail have become significantly more extended, indicating increased activity as it approaches the sun. This visitor from another star system poses no threat to Earth and provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study its composition. By analyzing the light it emits, astronomers hope to understand more about the chemistry of objects formed outside our own solar system.</p>
