          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber responded to criticism from Education Secretary Linda McMahon regarding antisemitism on campus, asserting that Harvard shares common ground in combating bigotry. Garber defended Harvard's commitment to freedom of thought while criticizing the federal government's overreach into private universities' affairs, as the Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to the university and threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. He refuted claims that Harvard is a partisan institution, emphasizing its commitment to intellectual diversity and inclusivity. Garber highlighted actions Harvard has taken to address campus issues, including installing new deans and clarifying discipline procedures.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant flight delays due to a staffing shortage at an air traffic control facility and recent radar outages. The FAA is delaying incoming flights to Newark by several hours from various airports, causing cascading effects worldwide. United Airlines' CEO assured customers of flight safety despite the FAA issues. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for past missteps and announced plans to reduce flights and upgrade infrastructure to mitigate delays, including software updates and new fiber-optic cables.</p>

          <p>The White House is considering policies to encourage parents to stay home with their children, including increased child tax credits and the removal of federal tax credits for day care. This push aligns with a conservative social agenda promoting traditional family structures, though studies are inconclusive about whether children fare better in day care or at home. The proposed legislation aims to give families more choice, but critics argue it may not be sufficient for one parent to stay home, especially given the rising costs of living and the need for two incomes in many American families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on Chinese products following significant trade disruptions and warnings from American businesses about higher prices. The agreement lowers US tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China's tariffs on American goods to 10% for 90 days, while officials seek a more permanent trade deal. The move follows weeks of escalating tariffs that brought much trade between the countries to a standstill. Some analysts view the agreement as a retreat that vindicates China‚Äôs decision to retaliate forcefully, while others see it as a welcome reprieve for businesses.</p>

          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess costs and progress on the Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, an Amtrak project facing budget overruns. This consultation raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given Musk's leadership roles in companies regulated by federal agencies and his advisory role to President Trump. The Department of Transportation confirmed the Boring Company is one of several firms being consulted, while Musk has previously criticized Amtrak and other rail projects. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel aims to replace a 152-year-old tunnel along Amtrak's Northeast Corridor.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is targeting nine petroleum-based, synthetic food dyes, citing concerns that toxic chemicals in food are linked to rising rates of obesity and chronic illnesses in the US. Kennedy intends to rid the U.S. food supply of these chemicals in as soon as 18 months. The US allows thousands of additives in food, often self-certified as safe by companies, while Europe generally presumes new food additives unsafe until proven otherwise. Research on these chemicals tends to be narrow, and regulators don't routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market.</p>

The authority, dominated by Fatah, has long been at odds with the Qatar-funded media company, accusing it of supporting Hamas.

          <p>News of a US agreement with China to temporarily ease tariffs sent stocks soaring, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average experiencing significant gains. The agreement, struck in Switzerland, will lower tariffs by 115% for 90 days, reducing the US tariff on Chinese imports to 30% and China's rate on American goods to 10%. Investors are now focused on whether this temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement, with tech, retail, and travel companies seeing widespread gains.

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport after a telecommunications line failed again, according to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy. Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not adequately equipping the Philadelphia air traffic control facility after hardware issues surfaced last year.

Duffy plans to request an investigation into the move of Newark air traffic controllers to Philadelphia and has proposed a multibillion-dollar plan to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system.</p>

Chinese negotiators appear to have convinced President Donald Trump's administration to roll back most of the 145% tariff rate that Trump imposed, and slash them to 30%.

In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed.

          <p>Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, has signed a first-in-the-nation executive order to block the federal government from collecting personal health data related to autism, a direct rebuke to the Trump administration. Pritzker, a Democrat who has been one of the more vocal critics of Donald Trump‚Äôs second administration, signed the order last week, saying he wanted to protect ‚Äúdignity, privacy, and the freedom to live without fear of surveillance or discrimination‚Äù. It came two days after the US Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, announced a plan to use data maintained by the National Institutes of Health, and claims submitted for Medicare and Medicaid coverage, to determine the causes of autism.</p>

          <p>House Republicans on Monday outlined their plans for an expansive tax bill that would temporarily enact President Trump‚Äôs campaign pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, roll back subsidies for clean energy and create a new type of tax-advantaged investment account for children. The bill, which the Ways and Means Committee will formally take up on Tuesday, amounts to the first full attempt at detailing Republicans‚Äô plans for cutting taxes this year. The legislation ends some of the clean-energy tax credits Democrats passed under President Joseph R. Biden Jr., with a $7,500 consumer subsidy for purchasing an electric vehicle largely eliminated.</p>
