        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Carnival shares experienced a surge of approximately 7% after the cruise line announced better-than-expected second-quarter results and increased its full-year guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share, surpassing analysts' estimates, with adjusted revenue reaching a record $6.3 billion. Net income significantly increased to $565 million from $92 million the previous year, and CEO Josh Weinstein noted strong momentum across all of the company's brands. Carnival has raised its full-year guidance, anticipating adjusted net income to be 40% higher than 2024 and adjusted EBITDA to reach $6.9 billion.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 15:38:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the interest earned on a $10,000 1-year CD versus a high-yield savings account, finding that the CD earns slightly more due to its fixed interest rate of 4.45% compared to the savings account's 4.30%. The CD guarantees $445 in interest, while the savings account's earnings could fluctuate due to variable rates. Money market accounts are also mentioned as a viable alternative, but they also carry the risk of variable interest rates. The key takeaway is that a CD provides a guaranteed return, but it requires keeping the money in the account for the full term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach are preparing for a new wave of ocean freight from China, driven by importers aiming to beat potential tariff increases. Vessel tracking data indicates an uptick in ship arrivals, reaching the highest levels since January 2025. Despite the increase, officials do not anticipate congestion due to recent softness in container traffic, and terminals are operating below full capacity. The expected boost in containers is expected to benefit trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, providing more work for dockworkers. </p>

          <h2>Home Equity Loan vs. Personal Loan: Which is Cheaper This June?</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the cost of a $50,000 home equity loan versus a $50,000 personal loan in June 2025, finding that the home equity loan is cheaper due to its lower interest rate. The average home equity loan rate is 8.25%, while the personal loan rate is 12.65%, resulting in a monthly savings of around $109 with the home equity loan. HELOCs are also discussed, but their variable rates make them a riskier option. The article concludes that a home equity loan is generally the better choice for those seeking lower, fixed payments.
