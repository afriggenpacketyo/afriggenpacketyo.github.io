The 2021 champion displayed strong serving and powerful groundstrokes, continuing her positive form on the North American hard court circuit and will next face former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. Fellow Briton Cameron Norrie also progressed after a grueling four-hour, four-set win against Francisco Comesana. Norrie's victory sets up a challenging third-round match against 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic.</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, projecting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive report, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates. The results confirm the central role of Nvidia's technology in the global AI infrastructure boom, with the company forecasting massive industry spending by the end of the decade. The report also noted no sales of its custom H20 chip to China due to geopolitical restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a grand Victorian-era hunting lodge on the Scottish Isle of Rum, is back on the market with an asking price over £750,000. The sale, managed by the government agency NatureScot, comes after a previous deal collapsed amid a dispute between a potential buyer and a Scottish government minister. The local community of about 40 residents has expressed a strong desire for any new owner to be committed to the island's sustainability and heritage. The castle is in a state of disrepair, and its sale presents a unique opportunity for restoration and redevelopment of the historic property.</p>

          <p>The first professional women's baseball league since the 1950s held its final day of tryouts at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., signaling a historic revival of the sport. Over 600 players from ten countries participated, with the final selections becoming eligible for a draft ahead of the league's planned 2026 debut. The league aims to provide a sustainable platform for female athletes, with stars like Kelsie Whitmore and Mo’ne Davis bringing visibility to the new venture. This will be the first-ever integrated professional women's baseball league in the U.S., correcting the whites-only policy of its predecessor.</p>

          <h2>YouTube TV and Fox Agree to Short-Term Extension, Averting Channel Blackout</h2>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corporation have reached a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports from being removed from the streaming service. The previous agreement was set to expire just days before major college football and NFL games were scheduled to air, which would have impacted millions of subscribers. The dispute centers on the fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, which Google claims are "far higher" than those for comparable offerings. Negotiations for a new long-term deal are ongoing, with the extension providing temporary relief for viewers.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officialized the rivalry between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres with a new trophy: a custom Fender Telecaster guitar named the 'Vedder Cup.' The trophy is named for Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who has strong ties to both cities, and was even played by the musician before being presented. The guitar features custom artwork, team logos, and branding for a nonprofit co-founded by Vedder to fund research for a rare skin disease. The Mariners won the inaugural series, claiming the unique trophy that Vedder insists should be played, not just displayed.</p>

          <p>A controversial immigration detention facility located in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," will have no detainees remaining within a few days, according to a state official. The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management confirmed the development in an email to an interfaith community group. The facility has been the subject of lawsuits, one of which successfully halted the transfer of new detainees to the site. This closure comes as Florida's governor recently announced the opening of a new immigration detention center in the state, which has been dubbed the "Deportation Depot."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising car prices and high interest rates, a record number of consumers are committing to monthly auto payments of $1,000 or more. To avoid financial strain, experts from Edmunds advise buyers to avoid several common pitfalls, including purchasing a vehicle beyond their means and accepting dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan from a bank or credit union. Other costly errors include trading in a car with negative equity, which rolls debt into a new loan, and failing to negotiate with a dealership's internet sales team first. Consumers are also encouraged to consider certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid steep new-car depreciation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing likely in September, savers have a limited window to maximize returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial analysts recommend that consumers act proactively by shopping for the highest rates, which are often found at online banks due to their lower overhead costs. It is also crucial for individuals to accurately assess how much they can afford to lock away to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Securing the longest-term CD possible within one's budget can lock in current high rates for an extended period. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing financing, September may be an opportune time to consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). With average interest rates lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, HELOCs currently represent one of the more affordable borrowing options. Furthermore, because HELOCs have variable rates, they could become even cheaper if the Federal Reserve proceeds with an anticipated interest rate cut this month. Rising home equity levels across the country also mean that homeowners may have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or projects. (not investment advice)</p>
