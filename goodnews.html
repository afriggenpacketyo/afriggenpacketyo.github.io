          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying approximately 20,000 military personnel for a major security operation during the Brics summit, which hosts leaders from 28 countries. The measures include a strict no-fly zone over the summit venue, enforced by armed fighter jets with authorization to shoot down unauthorized aircraft posing a threat. The city's main domestic airport, Santos Dumont, will be closed to commercial traffic, with flights rerouted to the international terminal. This level of security, comparable to the 2016 Olympics, highlights the significance of the gathering of major emerging economies from the Global South.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:02:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Fourth of July celebrations approaching, experts from Canine Companions offer advice on how to manage pets' fear of fireworks. Because dogs have highly sensitive hearing, it is recommended not to bring them to fireworks displays. Instead, owners should exercise their dogs earlier in the day to tire them out and provide mental stimulation like puzzle toys. For dogs sensitive to noise, creating a safe, comfortable space at home, playing white noise, and using calming products like thunder shirts can help mitigate anxiety. The goal is to create a positive association and ensure the pet's safety during the loud festivities.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Think Tank Proposes $4.2 Trillion Debt Swap to Address Local Government Liabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 18:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Beijing-based think tank has proposed that China issue 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap out the hidden debts of local governments. The proposal, from Tsinghua University's Academic Centre for Chinese Economic Practice and Thinking, aims to resolve the nation's local-level debt and real estate crises. Researchers argue this proactive fiscal measure is necessary to mitigate significant financial risks and re-energize economic growth, which is being hampered by the high debt load. The report suggests this comprehensive package would be a decisive step toward stabilizing the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system, a comet officially named 3I/ATLAS. The object was spotted using a telescope in Chile and is currently about 420 million miles from Earth, posing no threat. Traveling at 37 miles per second, the comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, passing between the orbits of Mars and Earth. Astronomers worldwide are now observing the object to determine its size and composition, providing a rare opportunity to study material from another star system.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: A Simplified Payment System Could Make GLP-1 Anti-Obesity Drugs More Affordable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:27:45 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion article argues that GLP-1 anti-obesity medications could become more affordable in the U.S. through a simplified payment system for employer-sponsored health plans. The author suggests eliminating the complex system of rebates and coupons, which inflates list prices. Instead, manufacturers could charge health plans the same direct-to-consumer price of around $500 per month, with employers then contributing a portion of the cost. This would lower out-of-pocket expenses for employees, increase access to these transformative drugs, and reduce the administrative burden of prior authorizations, ultimately improving public health by addressing cardiometabolic disease.</p>

          <h2>New Legislation Creates Temporary Federal Tax Exemption on Tipped Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 17:22:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive spending and tax package passed by Congress includes a provision creating a temporary tax exemption for tipped workers. The new rule allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their federally taxable income, a policy that will be in effect until the end of 2028. For individuals earning over $150,000 a year, tipped income will still be subject to taxation. The policy, a key campaign promise from President Trump, is expected to benefit most middle-income tipped workers, while Democrats criticized the overall bill for its deep cuts to programs like Medicaid.

Her benefits include free health insurance and stipends for rent and travel, allowing her to save up to $1,000 a month, something she couldn't do in the U.S. Despite some cultural challenges, she feels safer and more confident, finding a sense of freedom and adventure.</p>

Starboard Value is known for its activist campaigns, which often involve advocating for new leadership, cost-cutting measures, or strategic reviews.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the American founding, particularly the Declaration of Independence, is often misinterpreted as a celebration of pure individualism. The author contends that the revolution was primarily an effort to restore the colonists' inherited political traditions as Englishmen, which they believed King George III had violated. Furthermore, the declaration's famous assertion that all men are created equal is not a universally self-evident truth but one derived specifically from the West's biblical inheritance, particularly the concept that man is created in God's image. The piece concludes that political and biblical heritage were more influential than revolutionary individualism.</p>

          <p>A sweeping domestic policy bill passed by the House includes a new temporary tax break for senior citizens, providing an additional standard deduction of $6,000 for individuals and $12,000 for couples. The deduction, available for tax filers aged 65 and older from 2025 through 2028, begins to phase out for those with incomes over $75,000. This provision is an income tax deduction and does not eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits as previously discussed during political campaigns. Analysts note that the benefit is primarily aimed at upper-middle-class seniors, as most lower-income seniors do not have a high enough tax liability to claim it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued strength in June, with employers adding 147,000 jobs, surpassing economists' predictions. The unemployment rate fell to a low of 4.1%, according to the Labor Department. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce continued to shrink due to significant cuts. Despite economic uncertainty surrounding trade and fiscal policy, the resilient job numbers suggest the Federal Reserve will likely hold off on cutting interest rates at its upcoming meeting.
