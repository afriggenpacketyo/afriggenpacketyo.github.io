          <p>The UK is set to bolster its defense capabilities with a ¬£1.5 billion investment in bomb factories and a commitment to purchasing 7,000 long-range weapons, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Other headlines include concerns about junior doctors' strikes and political commentary on Prime Minister Starmer's handling of border control, as well as celebrity news about Dani Dyer's wedding and a businessman accused of spying for China.

          <h2>TikTok 'McMigraine Meal' Hack Gains Popularity Despite Expert Skepticism</h2>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that a "McMigraine Meal" consisting of a full-fat coke and salty fries can alleviate migraine symptoms, though medical experts remain skeptical. While some individuals report that the caffeine and sugar in coke, or the salt in fries, may provide temporary relief, experts warn against relying on this method. Dr. Kay Kennis notes that caffeine can disrupt nerve activity, but excessive caffeine can also trigger migraines. Neurologist Peter Goadsby emphasizes the importance of lifestyle changes and listening to one's body, rather than relying on social media trends, for migraine management. </p>
