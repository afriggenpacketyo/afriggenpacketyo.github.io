          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. Trump told reporters that the deal involves investment and partial ownership, but control will remain with the United States, adding that he wouldn't approve the deal otherwise. He also mentioned that the partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the economy. Trump noted that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh and that the bulk of Nippon Steel's investment will occur over the next 14 months.</p>

          <p>President Trump has delayed his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US following a conversation with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen announced a tariff delay to July 9, providing more time for negotiations. Trump had previously warned he would impose the tariffs on June 1 due to stalled discussions, but this decision marks a reversal. This delay aims to allow both sides to reach a new trade agreement and de-escalate tensions between the US and EU.</p>
