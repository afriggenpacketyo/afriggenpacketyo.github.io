        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a problematic February bar exam plagued by technical difficulties, the State Bar of California has approved scoring adjustments, leading to over 200 test-takers changing from "fail" to "pass." The adjustments, including giving applicants the higher of two scores for written questions, increased the overall pass rate from 56% to 63%. This decision comes after lawsuits were filed due to the exam's issues, with the state bar implementing remedies like a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for those unable to complete significant portions. While some trustees expressed concerns about the higher pass rate and the bar's duty to protect the public from unqualified lawyers, the Bar said it aimed to find fair solutions while maintaining the exam's integrity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has revealed that it is underperforming and requires stronger regulation to better protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlighted that public trust has been undermined by issues such as pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. Set up by the government in October amid public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, the review aims to address these critical shortcomings. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, arguing it would be too expensive and not necessarily lead to improvements.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is set to enhance its defense capabilities by building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and preparing its army for potential conflict in Europe, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. This military boost, designed to signal resolve to both Moscow and Washington, represents the most significant changes to British defenses since the Soviet Union's collapse. The plans, responding to a strategic defense review, include increased weapons production, investment in cyber command, and a commitment to NATO. While aiming to increase defense spending to 3% of national income, the government faces questions about funding and the feasibility of achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are reviewing stadium safety after a Yankees fan reported being hit by a piece of concrete falling from the stadium ceiling during a game. The incident prompted the installation of concrete netting in the affected area of the stadium. The Dodgers are conducting a facility examination to ensure safety and plan a longer-term review. Dodger Stadium, the oldest MLB stadium west of the Mississippi, underwent a major renovation project before the 2020 season.</p>
