          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has officially formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will intensify, possibly reaching low-grade hurricane status over the weekend. However, the system is expected to track north of the Caribbean and remain over open waters for several days, posing no immediate threat to any land areas. Officials note that while the season was predicted to be busy, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol Through Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits that are staples of the chimpanzee diet, finding it to be around 0.3% by weight. While this low dose is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in primate fruit-eating habits. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits eaten by wild chimps.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has advised against scrapping the current system of individualized care plans for children with special educational needs. In a new report, the Education Select Committee urged the government to keep Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) as a legal backstop for parents. The committee also recommended establishing new national minimum standards for support in schools and providing more training for teachers. The report comes as the government prepares to announce reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable despite rising demand.</p>

          <p>During his second state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump hailed the 'irreplaceable and unbreakable' bond between the two nations at a lavish banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. The visit, filled with royal pageantry, is aimed at deepening economic ties, with billions in new U.S. tech investments already pledged. While Trump expressed his delight at the honor, the visit was met with large-scale protests in London, where thousands marched to voice their opposition. The second day of the visit will focus on geopolitical and trade discussions with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its interest rate, policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to hold their rate steady at 4%. The UK's inflation rate remained at 3.8% in August, well above the 2% target, making a rate cut unlikely as it could fuel further price increases. The Bank had previously cut its rate from 4.25% in August, but analysts believe further reductions are improbable for the remainder of the year, affecting borrowing costs and mortgage rates across the country.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors against making major portfolio changes based solely on the Federal Reserve's recent 0.25% interest rate cut. He argued that the move was widely anticipated and does not fundamentally alter the major themes driving the market. Cramer suggested that the Fed, led by Chair Jerome Powell, is taking a prudent and steady approach in a difficult position, balancing concerns over tariff-driven inflation with a weakening labor market. He asserted that this cautious strategy is exactly what the economy needed. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision aims to lower the cost of funding for businesses and ease the financial burden on mortgage borrowers in the city. The Fed's cut was justified by Chairman Jerome Powell as a reaction to growing signs of weakness in the U.S. labor market, despite some ongoing concerns about inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
