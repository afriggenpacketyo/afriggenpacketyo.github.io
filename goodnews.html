        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to potentially make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., even as far south as northern California and Alabama. Space weather officials detected a solar flare associated with this storm, which is expected to last through late Monday. The coronal mass ejection causing the storm could disrupt power systems, impede satellite operations, and hamper radio communications. The northern lights are caused by solar wind hitting Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere and are typically best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

Cory Booker emphasized the need for bold policy and remembering the courage of past civil rights leaders.

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major defence review, announcing plans to build up to 12 new attack submarines. The review is expected to recommend that the armed forces move to "warfighting readiness" in response to growing threats. The prime minister is also expected to confirm a ¬£15bn investment in the UK's nuclear warhead programme. The new submarines, alongside the UK's nuclear-armed submarines, are intended to keep "Britain and Nato safe for decades."</p>

          <p>According to Angela Zhang, a law professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, new US-China tariffs are expected to impact the Chinese technology sector in two main ways. The tariffs will make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, and Chinese companies will need to work harder on cutting costs and scaling up. Chinese companies may look more aggressively to other markets, such as Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and increase efforts to deepen trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access.</p>

Bublik won his next event and is slowly climbing the rankings again, but Draper will be keen to ensure a first Grand Slam quarter-final appearance.</p>
