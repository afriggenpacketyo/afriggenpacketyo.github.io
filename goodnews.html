          <p>The start of the third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to bad weather, specifically thunder. Practice had previously been suspended for 17 minutes because of the threat of lightning in the area. The article lists the scheduled tee times that were affected as a result of the weather delay. The golfers were preparing to continue the tournament when the suspension was announced, disrupting the planned schedule.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, potentially allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The proposal aims to restore some of the pre-Brexit freedoms for young people to travel and study in Europe. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the possible scheme as "free movement through the back door," while Sir Keir insisted it would be a reciprocal arrangement and not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The agreement is expected to be discussed at an upcoming summit between the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have conducted wind tunnel tests indicating that plasma excitation technology can significantly improve the aerodynamic performance of high-altitude drones. The study found that plasma generated by high-voltage currents could boost an aircraft wing's lift-to-drag ratio by nearly 88%, which is critical for superior flight efficiency. This technology has the potential to extend the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones. The research, conducted by the State Key Laboratory of Aerodynamics, suggests significant advancements in drone technology that could lead to longer flight times and improved performance at extreme altitudes.</p>

          <p>On his tour of the Middle East this week, Donald Trump announced a slew of multibillion-dollar tech deals with the leaders of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. With the sale of the US‚Äôs most advanced technology, he also sold the American model of the industry that made it: enormous amounts of power concentrated in the hands of a few men. The announcements poured in last week: the US and the United Arab Emirates agreed on Abu Dhabi as the site of the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the US. The deal reportedly allows the UAE to import half a million Nvidia semiconductor chips, considered the most advanced in the world for the creation of artificial intelligence products.

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of debilitating calf pain before being diagnosed with Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES), a rare condition where the popliteal artery is compressed by muscles and tendons. Despite numerous doctor visits and tests, Prindle finally received a diagnosis in 2021, five years after the pain began. She underwent multiple surgeries, including one by a specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, to correct the condition and restore blood flow. Prindle's story highlights the challenges of diagnosing rare conditions and the importance of advocating for oneself to find appropriate medical care.</p>

          <p>An unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, acquired by Harvard Law School in 1946 for $27.50, has been confirmed as an original, dating back to the final iteration issued by Edward I in 1300. Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent used spectral imaging and ultraviolet light to authenticate the document. The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, declared that all people, including royalty, had personal rights and that even kings had to abide by laws. This rediscovery highlights the enduring importance of the Magna Carta in shaping legal principles, particularly in the context of current debates about executive authority and individual rights.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on foreign-produced movies has sparked debate about the future of Hollywood and the American film industry. The plan, aimed at revitalizing domestic production, has received mixed reactions from industry unions and experts. While some support the idea of financial incentives to keep film production in the U.S., others worry about the potential negative impact on studios and the industry's overall vigor. The discussion highlights the challenges of balancing protectionism with the globalized nature of filmmaking and the need for innovative solutions to support American cinema.</p>

Chevron's efficient production portfolio supports its massive buyback program, and the company is expected to generate an incremental $9 billion of free cash flow in 2026 at a $60-per-barrel Brent price.
