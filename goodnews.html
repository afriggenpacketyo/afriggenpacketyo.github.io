          <p>A Reddit user recounted an incident at his girlfriend's mother's birthday party where a toddler was allowed to destroy an expensive cake, prompting him to move it out of reach.

The article explores the differing opinions on whether he was justified in his actions, considering the child's age and the family's tolerance for the behavior. The clinical psychologist recommended transparent and honest conversations about family conflicts as the best path toward a clear resolution.</p>
