          <p>China has reportedly offered a "pretty significant" tax refund to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and Martell, in an effort to resolve an ongoing anti-dumping investigation. According to a source, the deal is contingent on the companies agreeing to a minimum import price and committing to refrain from dumping practices.
