          <p>A Taiwanese YouTuber, known as Gym Boss, who was previously critical of Beijing, has encouraged Taiwanese people to visit Shanghai to experience the city firsthand. During a live stream, he described Shanghai as a ‚Äúsuper first-rate city,‚Äù aiming to challenge negative perceptions prevalent in Taiwan. Chen, once a supporter of Taiwan‚Äôs ruling Democratic Progressive Party, said his views changed after observing mainland China through social media, noting a discrepancy between online narratives and the reality he perceived. He believes experiencing Shanghai can bridge the gap between political messaging and the actual quality of life in the city. The YouTuber's tour is self-funded and intended to offer an unfiltered look at mainland Chinese society.</p>

Ohtani's fastest pitch was clocked at 96 miles per hour, and he used all his pitches effectively, showcasing his ability to control the baseball.

          <p>Fire Island Pines, a queer haven off the coast of Long Island, has evolved into a legendary destination for weekend parties and personal liberation over the past century. Architect Horace Gifford significantly shaped the island's aesthetic with his timber-framed modernist homes that embraced the natural landscape and celebrated sexual freedom. Gifford's designs featured compact, sustainable living spaces that integrated seamlessly with the island's environment, though his career was impacted by an arrest during a police raid in 1965. The island's vibrant history, including its rise as a gay mecca and the impact of the AIDS crisis, is chronicled in Christopher Rawlins' book, "Fire Island Modernist," which explores Gifford's architectural contributions and the island's unique culture.</p>

          <p>Gregory May, the U.S. Consul General for Hong Kong and Macau, is reportedly being considered for a senior role in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. This move comes at a crucial time for U.S.-China relations, as both countries engage in high-stakes talks to manage escalating trade and export control measures. May's potential new position would make him a top aide to the new American ambassador, David Perdue, at the embassy, which has a staff of 1,300. Sources indicate that May's experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan makes him a leading candidate to assist Ambassador Perdue, particularly given the difficulties in political exchanges in Hong Kong due to recent sanctions.</p>

He argued that the death penalty goes against the principles of democracy, human rights, and the sanctity of life, while also highlighting the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals.
