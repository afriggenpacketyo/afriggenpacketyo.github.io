        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on economic growth and inflation, which complicates decisions about interest rate cuts. While a strong labor market has allowed the Fed to maintain steady interest rates, the uncertainty caused by tariffs is prompting businesses to shelve investments and slow hiring. Concerns are rising that consumer pessimism could lead to reduced spending, potentially triggering layoffs and an economic slowdown, even as the latest jobs report showed better-than-expected payroll growth and a stable unemployment rate. The central bank is now debating whether tariff-related price pressures will be temporary or lead to persistent inflation.</p>

          <p>The Army is reportedly planning a potential military parade in Washington, D.C., on President Trump's birthday in June, which would include thousands of troops, vehicles, and aircraft. Planning documents detail a large-scale event involving over 6,600 soldiers, at least 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, tanks, seven bands, and possibly thousands of civilians. The parade, likely to cost tens of millions of dollars, would coincide with the Army's 250th-anniversary festival on the National Mall, but no final decisions have been made, and concerns remain about the cost and potential damage to city roads.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated video game Grand Theft Auto 6 has been delayed until May 2026, according to developer Rockstar Games, who cited the need for extra time to meet quality expectations. The sequel to the record-breaking GTA 5 was initially slated for release later this year, but the delay has sparked disappointment among fans eager for the next installment. Rockstar is known for its long development cycles and perfectionist approach, but the 12-year gap since GTA 5's release has fueled impatience and jokes online, though it is expected to be a sales record breaker upon its eventual release.</p>

          <p>The Marvel film Thunderbolts*, starring Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova, has garnered positive reviews despite initial skepticism. The article highlights that the movie might be the most enjoyable Marvel film since Avengers: Endgame, with the premise following a team of morally gray antiheroes. Directed by Jake Schreier, the film leans into the relative anonymity of its ensemble cast, which includes Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, and David Harbour. The film's plot involves the team reluctantly joining forces against Valentina Allegra de Fontaine, an evil bureaucrat funding the creation of her own experimental super team.</p>

Trump asserted that there is "NO INFLATION" and the Fed should lower its rate to stimulate the economy. This statement continues his pattern of attempting to influence the central bank's decision-making process, challenging its independence.

The oil major's global production business posted increased earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana, while the refining business saw a decline in profits due to lower refining margins.
