          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that would cut billions in funding for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially impacting millions of Americans, including a significant portion of their own constituents. A recent KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace health plans identify as Republicans, many of whom are self-employed and reside in states that did not expand Medicaid. Experts suggest that cutting ACA funding and failing to extend tax credits could leave approximately 15 million people without health insurance. This situation highlights a potential conflict between Republican policy goals and the healthcare needs of their constituents (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Rolls-Royce has received backing from the U.K. government to construct Britain's first small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs).

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that the SMR project would create thousands of jobs, bolster regional economies, and enhance energy security. The Labour government anticipates that the SMRs could power the equivalent of 3 million homes once connected to the grid in the mid-2030s. </p>
