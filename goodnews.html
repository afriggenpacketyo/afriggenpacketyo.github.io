        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The agreement allows schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and provides $2.7 billion to former players barred from revenue sharing. The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools that were forced to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing the billions in TV and other revenue, mostly through football and basketball, that keep this machine humming. This settlement is expected to professionalize college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program cuts, while also raising concerns about the future of Olympic sports.

The city's appeal has grown since the summer of 2024, as companies look to Hong Kong's stock exchange for capital infusions due to the animosity towards Chinese companies by the US.</p>
