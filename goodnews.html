          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 07:46:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British pound has reached its highest level in over three years against the U.S. dollar, although analysts are divided on whether it will continue to rise. Much of the pound's recent strength is attributed to dollar weakness rather than specific confidence in sterling, with factors like unpredictable U.S. trade policies shaking confidence in American assets. While some analysts predict further dollar weakening and a rise in the pound, others foresee limited near-term upside due to softer UK economic momentum and potential Bank of England rate cuts. Longer-term catalysts for the pound could include improved relations with the EU, but macroeconomic conditions may not fully support sterling's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and housing demand are stuck in a holding pattern, with economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts having little impact on rate movement. Rates have remained in a narrow range around 7% since early April, offering little incentive to potential homebuyers facing high prices and low inventory. Mortgage applications to buy a home decreased slightly, though purchase demand is up from last year, overall demand remains historically low. Applications to refinance a home loan increased, but volumes are so low that even small changes make for big percentage moves.</p>

          <p>President Trump is disputing an early Pentagon report that indicated the recent U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set the program back by a few months. Trump insists the strikes caused "total obliteration" and set Iran back "basically decades," while Defense Secretary Hegseth supported the president's position, suggesting the report leak had political motives. Democratic senators are calling for answers and suggest the conflict could have been avoided if Trump hadn't withdrawn from the Iran nuclear deal, and Trump expressed optimism about future relations with Iran.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court has dismissed a lawsuit filed by Ryanair challenging German state aid granted to Condor airline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case involved ‚Ç¨400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair argued the aid discriminated against other airlines, but the court found no evidence of this and ruled the Commission acted lawfully, and Ryanair may still appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice.</p>

This visit marks a second state visit for Trump, a gesture not traditionally extended to second-term US presidents, and formal planning for the event has now commenced.</p>

          <p>The Lakers and Clippers are likely aiming for the best available players in the upcoming NBA draft, with the Lakers lacking a first-round pick and the Clippers holding the 30th overall pick. The Lakers' priority is to find a rim-running center, but they will likely focus on developing a player from the second round, and contract status of key players such as Doncic, James, and Reaves is a major concern. The Clippers, on the other hand, may consider Noah Penda, a forward from France, to address their needs in the frontcourt, playmaking, and shooting.</p>
