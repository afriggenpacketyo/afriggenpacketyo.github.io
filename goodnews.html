          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 23:35:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is facing a potential deflationary spiral as it redirects exports, originally intended for the U.S. market, to its domestic market due to high tariffs. This move is supported by local governments and major businesses like JD.com and Tencent, who are promoting the sale of these goods to Chinese consumers. However, economists warn that this influx of discounted goods could trigger a price war among Chinese firms, eroding profitability and impacting employment. Consequently, weak consumer demand and uncertain job prospects may lead to a decline in both consumer and producer price indices, exacerbating deflationary pressures across the economy.

          <p>Silent book clubs are experiencing a surge in popularity, offering a unique social experience centered around reading in a shared space. Unlike traditional book clubs, members can read any book of their choice, fostering a relaxed and mindful environment. Participants appreciate the opportunity to unplug from technology and immerse themselves in their books while enjoying the presence of others. The trend, which originated in San Francisco in 2012, has grown to over 1,600 chapters in 54 countries, indicating a resurgence in people seeking social activities that don't revolve around drinking or dating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are debating the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on workplace inequality, with some fearing it could exacerbate existing disparities. While AI can increase productivity, there's concern it may displace workers and widen the gap between nations. Some workplace leaders suggest adapting employment strategies rather than trying to prevent job losses, focusing on upskilling employees and creating new roles. Additionally, ethical considerations surrounding bias in AI are being discussed, as AI systems can amplify existing biases present in human-generated data. The Microsoft Trend Index indicates that many leaders plan to expand workforce capacity using AI, while also considering headcount reductions.</p>

          <p>A report from the Health and Social Care Select Committee warns that failing to address England's social care system for older and disabled adults is unsustainable. The report emphasizes the financial and human costs of inaction, highlighting that taxpayers currently spend ¬£32 billion annually on a broken system. It suggests that investing in social care could stimulate economic growth, creating jobs and generating returns to the wider economy. The committee calls for improved data collection and annual assessments of unmet care needs, stressing that social care is integral to NHS reforms.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that China's ongoing anti-corruption crackdown within the People's Liberation Army (PLA) should not be interpreted as a sign of President Xi Jinping's weakened control over the military. The campaign's impact on war readiness and modernization is considered limited, with internal competition among Xi's supporters potentially driving the investigations. Recent targets include members of the Central Military Commission (CMC), indicating a focus on rooting out corruption at the highest levels of the military.</p>

          <p>The Vatican is preparing for the conclave to elect a new pope following the death of Pope Francis, maintaining the centuries-old tradition of using smoke signals to communicate the outcome to the world. The process involves installing two stoves in the Sistine Chapel, one for burning ballots and the other for generating black or white smoke. Chemical compounds are carefully mixed to ensure a clear signal, with black smoke indicating no decision and white smoke signaling the election of a new pope. This tradition, despite modern communication advances, symbolizes continuity and secrecy while allowing the public to feel included in the process.</p>

Norris was further delayed because he passed Verstappen by going off track and had to give the place back. Stella also said that both drivers approached the overtaking similarly.</p>
