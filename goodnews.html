          <p>Investors are increasingly looking beyond traditional stock and bond portfolios, turning to alternative assets like gold and bitcoin for diversification and income. New exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are utilizing covered call option strategies to generate regular income from these typically non-yielding assets. This trend caters to investor demand for steady income streams, especially as the classic 60-40 portfolio has shown increased volatility. Major players like BlackRock are entering this space, signaling growing confidence in strategies that transform these assets from simple market hedges into income-producing investments.

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its 'Gold Card' visa program at a reduced price of $1 million, down from an initially proposed $5 million, sparking significant interest among the global wealthy. The program grants residency and promises expedited processing, making it highly competitive with similar 'golden visa' programs in other countries. Immigration attorneys report a surge in inquiries, particularly from families in China and India, who see the visa as a valuable entry into the U.S. system. However, the program faces potential legal challenges and logistical hurdles related to existing visa backlogs for certain nationalities.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread flooding and infrastructure damage, Asheville, North Carolina, is looking to the fall tourist season for a much-needed economic revival. The storm devastated local businesses, particularly in the hospitality sector, which lost its crucial October season last year and saw vacation rental demand drop by 20%. Many small business owners, having taken on significant debt to rebuild and reopen, are now heavily dependent on a strong influx of autumn visitors to recover their losses. The community remains resilient but anxious, as the success of the upcoming season could determine their financial survival through the winter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, experienced a significant jump after President Trump announced a 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The new tariff, set to begin on October 1st, is intended to shield American truck makers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. Paccar, which manufactures the vast majority of its trucks for the U.S. market domestically, is seen by analysts as a primary beneficiary of this policy. The move is expected to address the price disparity between its U.S.-made trucks and those produced more cheaply by competitors in Mexico. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An intellectual property attorney is advising aspiring entrepreneurs and side hustlers to secure a trademark as a fundamental first step to protect their business. According to Darlene Harris, managing attorney at Power In Protection, failing to trademark a business name, logo, or slogan leaves it vulnerable to being legally claimed by others. This oversight can lead to lawsuits and loss of profits, even for small-scale operations. Harris emphasizes that entrepreneurs should think long-term about their brand's growth and invest in a legal strategy that includes protections like copyrights and forming an LLC to separate personal and business liabilities.</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, held steady at a 2.9% annual rate in August, aligning with economists' expectations. The headline PCE, which includes food and energy, rose slightly to 2.7%. The data also revealed stronger-than-expected consumer spending and income growth, suggesting economic resilience despite the administration's import tariffs having a limited impact on prices so far. These stable inflation figures are unlikely to alter the Federal Reserve's current path, with markets still anticipating further interest rate reductions before the end of the year.

          <p>A Chinese technology company has successfully tested the world's most powerful flying wind turbine, an airship-like device named the S1500, in the Xinjiang region. The massive turbine, which floats on helium, generated one megawatt of power during its trial, marking a significant step toward its real-world application. Unlike traditional ground-based turbines, this airborne system is designed to capture stronger and more consistent winds at higher altitudes, delivering electricity back to the ground via cables. The developers aim for mass production by 2026, with the first units expected to connect to the grid in the same year.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's ownership group, Enic, has firmly rejected a third informal expression of interest in buying the Premier League club, this time from a consortium led by American tech entrepreneur Brooklyn Earick. The club reiterated that it is not for sale and that Enic has no intention of selling its nearly 87% stake. This follows the rejection of two other approaches earlier in the month after the departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy. A source close to the majority owners, the family of Joe Lewis, emphasized their commitment to the club and its success on the pitch.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering a bipartisan bill, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aimed at making Social Security's retirement options easier for Americans to understand. The proposed legislation would change the official terminology for claiming ages to better reflect the financial outcomes. For example, 'early eligibility age' (62) would become 'minimum benefit age,' and 'full retirement age' would be renamed 'standard benefit age.' Proponents argue that the current language is confusing and that these changes would more clearly communicate the permanent benefit reductions or increases associated with claiming at different ages, helping people make more informed decisions about their retirement.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan housing bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, is gaining unanimous support in the Senate Banking Committee for its approach to boosting housing supply. The bill proposes creating model zoning codes that encourage denser construction and offers financial incentives to municipalities that adopt reforms and successfully increase their housing stock. This federal-level strategy is designed to overcome local-level opposition that often stifles development. Analysts suggest this approach could function like 'Right-to-Build Zones,' allowing cities to apply less restrictive rules in specific areas to spur construction without facing widespread backlash, thereby cutting through governmental gridlock.</p>
