          <p>Renowned market strategist Tom Lee has joined BitMine Immersion Technologies as chairman, aiming to transform the company into a leading publicly-traded holder of Ethereum. The firm announced a $250 million private placement to acquire ETH, which it will hold as its primary treasury reserve asset. This strategy is based on the belief that Ethereum will benefit from the rapid adoption of stablecoins, the majority of which operate on its blockchain. The move mirrors MicroStrategy's well-known Bitcoin accumulation strategy and highlights a growing corporate trend of looking beyond Bitcoin for treasury management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Politburo, led by President Xi Jinping, has approved new rules aimed at standardizing the operations of the party's top decision-making commissions and groups. The regulations are designed to clarify the policy coordination and review processes for these powerful bodies, which have been central to Xi's governance. According to state media, the rules will ensure these commissions coordinate effectively with other government departments without overstepping their authority. This move is seen as an effort to formalize and streamline the top-level policy framework that has been established during Xi's tenure.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing flu shot in a late-stage clinical trial. The positive results clear a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the stand-alone flu vaccine and its combined COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to resubmit its application for the combination vaccine later this year, a move that could simplify vaccination schedules and improve public uptake. This development positions Moderna as a front-runner in the race to market a combination respiratory vaccine.</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate fell unexpectedly to 2.0% in June, according to preliminary data, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in an extended period. This figure was lower than the 2.2% that analysts had forecast, following a rate of 2.1% in May. As Europe's largest economy, Germany's inflation data is a key indicator for the ECB's monetary policy decisions for the entire eurozone.

          <p>Understanding a dog's experience of the world requires appreciating that their primary sense is smell, according to Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College. Unlike humans, who are primarily visual, dogs perceive their environment through a rich tapestry of scents that convey vast amounts of information. Horowitz explains that for a dog, smells are not just good or bad but are informational, creating a map of the world that is constantly changing. This olfactory perspective even shapes their perception of time, as the fading scent of a person can signify how long they have been gone.</p>

The company's annual sales reached $5.1 billion last year, driven by a strategy of operating its own restaurants rather than franchising and focusing exclusively on its core offerings of chicken fingers, fries, and Texas toast. This approach has led to high efficiency and strong average unit volumes, allowing the chain to reinvest its profits into further growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While tariffs are often discussed as a tool to boost American manufacturing, industry experts believe that a focus on workforce training and technology is more critical for reshoring. Decades of offshoring have eroded the skilled labor force, creating a significant talent hurdle for companies looking to establish domestic production. Panelists at a recent Sourcing Journal webinar suggested that uncertainty around tariff policies has actually slowed down reshoring investment. They advocate for long-term strategies, including creating pathways for skilled immigrants to fill crucial roles like sewing, to rebuild the nation's manufacturing capacity effectively.</p>

          <p>Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has dissipated into a tropical depression after making landfall on Mexico's eastern coast. The system, which briefly reached tropical storm strength, is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas over the next few days. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning for the area, cautioning that the system could produce up to eight inches of rain in isolated spots. Forecasters noted the storm weakened as it moved inland, though tropical storm conditions persisted near the coast.</p>

          <p>While Hollywood grapples with the controversial use of artificial intelligence, China's entertainment industry is adopting the technology with a more aggressive, no-holds-barred approach. A Chinese government-backed foundation has announced a project to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, potentially creating new animated versions or other reinterpretations. This initiative highlights the differing views on AI, as U.S. creative guilds raise strong concerns about intellectual property and labor displacement. In contrast, China's state-supported push sees AI as a tool to enhance cultural storytelling and global influence with fewer regulatory or labor-related obstacles.</p>
