          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile visit to China, signaling a potential easing of tensions in the ongoing tech trade war between the US and China. During his trip, Huang announced that Washington has approved the export of a less powerful, made-for-China AI chip, the H20, following a ban on more advanced models. This development comes as the two nations agreed on a new trade negotiation framework, leading to increased participation from US firms at a major Chinese supply chain expo.</p>

          <p>A fact-check article refutes viral social media claims that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling the assertion as false. Health experts confirm there is no scientific evidence to support this connection, and the rising incidence of skin cancer is more likely attributable to better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and other factors. While global sunscreen sales are increasing, data shows inconsistent use among populations in high-risk countries. The article clarifies that sunscreen remains a crucial tool for filtering harmful UV radiation and protecting against skin cancer.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in payment processing company Global Payments, which has seen its stock price decline significantly since 2021. The move comes after Global Payments announced a poorly received acquisition of Worldpay, raising investor concerns about management's strategy and execution capabilities. The article suggests Elliott's involvement could restore investor confidence by pushing for a reconstituted board, an M&A moratorium, and improved oversight to ensure the successful integration of the large acquisition.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Australian Wallabies 27-19 in a hard-fought opening Test match in Brisbane, taking a 1-0 lead in the series. The Lions established a commanding 24-5 lead early in the second half through tries from Sione Tuipulotu, Tom Curry, and Dan Sheehan, appearing dominant in the initial stages. However, the Wallabies mounted a comeback in the final 30 minutes, narrowing the score and exposing some weaknesses in the Lions' performance. Despite the win, the Lions' late-game lapse in discipline and accuracy left a sense of unease ahead of the next match.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the devastating Texas floods, a massive volunteer effort has enabled a summer camp for individuals with disabilities to reopen just 30 miles downstream from where another camp suffered tragic losses. Hundreds of volunteers, responding to a social media plea, brought manpower and machinery to clear debris and repair the 55-acre property, which serves over 800 campers each summer. This community-driven cleanup highlights a story of resilience and compassion amidst one of the worst natural disasters in Texas history, allowing the vital camp to continue its mission.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman who believed she had a simple pulled muscle from working out was diagnosed with metastatic malignant melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that had spread to her lungs and brain. The diagnosis was particularly shocking as she had no visible mole, which is the typical sign of the disease, and experienced no other symptoms like headaches or breathing problems. After undergoing an aggressive and difficult treatment combining radiation and immunotherapy, she has shown major improvement and is considered a "Stage IV miracle" by her doctors, offering hope for others with advanced cancer.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) has enabled a "leapfrog development" in relations between China and African nations, according to Chinese officials. Since the forum's inception in 2000, trade has surged nearly thirty-fold and Chinese investment has grown a hundred-fold. This economic partnership has been paralleled by deepening security cooperation, with China becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent and training thousands of African military officers annually, increasingly edging out traditional partners like the US and France.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced a significant reduction in its Military Working Equid program, with plans to put 141 of its 236 ceremonial horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in honor guards, parades, and funeral processions, most notably at Arlington National Cemetery. While they have not been used in combat for decades, the article describes them as a vital, living connection to American military heritage. The Army will retain some animals for key ceremonial duties, but the move marks the end of an era for this historic program.</p>

          <p>The United States has taken a significant step toward regulating digital currencies with the passage of its first major crypto-focused legislation, the GENIUS Act, which has now been signed into law. The bill establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market, and represents a major policy shift from the government's previous hands-off approach. While supporters hail the move as a win for financial innovation, critics worry that the new regulations, heavily influenced by industry lobbying, are too weak and could expose consumers and the economy to significant risk.</p>

          <p>Boxing icon Manny Pacquiao is making a comeback at age 46, four years after his last competitive fight, to challenge the much younger welterweight champion Mario Barrios. Despite his age, Pacquiao insists his passion and discipline remain, aiming to become the second-oldest champion in boxing history. The fight against the 30-year-old Barrios presents a significant challenge, as Pacquiao's last performance ended in a loss where he struggled to connect punches. The event will also feature the professional debut of his son, Emmanuel, on the undercard.</p>

          <p>A Mizuho analyst has raised the price target for Broadcom, citing expanded AI opportunities after the Trump administration allowed US companies to resume shipping certain AI GPUs to China. This policy shift is seen as a significant tailwind, potentially putting a major ASIC chip deal between Broadcom and ByteDance back on the table. The move reopens a market worth an estimated $50 billion, benefiting several US tech companies and providing potential upside to their revenue forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend has sparked a cross-generational discussion about the "Gen Z stare," described as a blank or unresponsive look from younger people during interactions. The article explores whether this phenomenon is real or simply the latest example of older generations complaining about the youth. Experts suggest that if the stare is more prevalent now, it may be linked to social skills being shaped differently by the internet and pandemic-era isolation. The frustration it causes in older generations may stem from interpreting this lack of non-verbal cues as a form of social rejection.</p>

          <p>Two leading UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt terminally ill individuals from paying council tax. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first authority to implement such a policy, which waives the tax for residents with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live. Advocates argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe financial shock, and removing the burden of a major bill like council tax would provide priceless peace of mind during an incredibly difficult time.</p>
