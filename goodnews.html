          <p>Levita Almuete Ferrer, a former budget analyst at the State Department, pleaded guilty to embezzling more than $650,000 from the agency over two years.

She faces up to 10 years in prison and must repay the stolen funds. Rubio is overhauling the 'bloated' state department in sweeping reform. Optimism score: 80</p>

          <p>An article discusses the debate around baby food pouches and the pressure on mothers to avoid ultra-processed foods. The author argues that the focus on pouches contributes to maternal guilt, suggesting that it is a way to shame women into returning to domestic roles. While acknowledging concerns about dietary issues, the author emphasizes the importance of considering social, political, and economic factors, such as time constraints and the need for convenience. She suggests that society should focus on supporting parents with improved leave, childcare, and resources rather than condemning their food choices. Optimism score: 75</p>
