          <p>King Charles III's visit to Ottawa is intended to highlight Canada's distinct sovereignty amid suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump about annexation. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, underscoring Canada's constitutional monarchy and separate identity. The article emphasizes that the visit reinforces the enduring bond between Canada and the British Commonwealth. The new U.S. ambassador to Canada downplayed the need for such messages, but royal historians believe Trump will notice the visit and recognize the differences between the two nations. </p>

          <p>Financial experts weigh in on suitable annuity options for seniors amidst market volatility and increasing lifespans. The article outlines four types of annuities: immediate, fixed indexed, deferred income, and variable, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Immediate annuities provide guaranteed lifetime income, while fixed indexed annuities offer growth potential with principal protection. Deferred income annuities provide higher payouts later, and variable annuities offer market exposure but come with higher risk and fees. Seniors should consult a financial advisor to determine the most appropriate annuity for their financial circumstances (not investment advice).</p>
