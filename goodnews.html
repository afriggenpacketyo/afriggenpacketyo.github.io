          <p>A recent incident where a Delta passenger was asked to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted confusion over airline policies regarding smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these pouches in both carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines set their own rules for in-flight use. Delta's policy explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping. However, policies for other major carriers like American and United are not clearly defined on their websites, leaving travelers uncertain about the rules.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul, 28, controlled the fight against a passive Chavez Jr., who rarely threw punches and spent most of the match behind a high guard. The judges scored the fight 99-91, 97-93, and 98-92 in favor of Paul, who now holds a professional record of 12-1. The performance raised further questions about the caliber of Paul's opponents, as Chavez Jr. appeared unmotivated and a shadow of his former self.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding the series' distinguished 24-year career in the nation's space program. The launch took place from Tanegashima island in southwestern Japan. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A has been a reliable workhorse for Japan's space exploration and satellite deployment efforts. The country's space program will now transition to the newer, more cost-effective H3 rocket as its primary launch vehicle, marking the end of an era.</p>

Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss.

          <p>New rules banning smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and bus shelters have gone into effect across France. The government aims to protect the public, especially children, from the dangers of secondhand smoke, which is linked to thousands of deaths annually in the country. Violators of the ban could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The measure is part of a broader national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, addressing France's relatively high smoking rate.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York, San Francisco, and Seattle, are holding large-scale Pride parades, marking the culmination of a month-long celebration of LGBTQ+ identity. This year's events blend joyous celebration with a more defiant, protest-oriented tone in response to recent political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights. Organizers have adopted themes like "Rise Up: Pride in Protest" and "Queer Joy is Resistance." The parades also face headwinds from reduced corporate sponsorship, reflecting a broader pullback from diversity and inclusion initiatives by some American companies.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans requiring food businesses in England to make it easier for customers to purchase healthy food. Under the voluntary partnership, supermarkets and manufacturers will be asked to encourage healthier shopping habits, potentially through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. Major retailers will report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability, with targets being set in collaboration with the industry. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the National Health Service.</p>
