          <p>Japan's parliament has passed a law mandating 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in April 2026. The law targets companies producing over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding it must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. This system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, although it may lead to price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

Researchers, working at a full-scale test line, report they have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride less unpleasant.

While most children experience mild COVID-19 symptoms, some can become seriously ill or develop long COVID. Experts debate whether annual vaccines are beneficial for children given their longer-lasting immunity and prior exposure to the virus, but vaccination remains important for children with underlying conditions and those living with high-risk individuals.</p>
