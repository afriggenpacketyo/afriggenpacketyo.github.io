        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Chinese policy adviser, Professor Zheng Yongnian, argues that China's think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He contends that these institutions should move away from Western academic models and focus on China's unique practical and empirical experiences. This self-centered approach, according to Zheng, is crucial for accurately explaining Chinese practices to the world and anticipating the nation's future development. By building on its own governance models, China can create a more authentic and compelling global narrative.</p>

Alcaraz, the defending Wimbledon champion, enters the match with a 24-match winning streak and a recent history of victories over Sinner.

          <p>A new art exhibition in Manhattan, curated by his granddaughter, celebrates the life and work of Dutch-American painter Joop Sanders, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 101. As the last surviving member of the original Abstract Expressionist movement, Sanders was a contemporary of figures like Willem de Kooning. The article explores his significant contributions to the art form and the reasons his fame was perhaps more subdued, including a period spent in Europe during the movement's peak. The retrospective serves as a reintroduction of his influential work to the public and a personal tribute from his family.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples therapy details five simple yet effective habits that people in the happiest relationships practice during the workweek. These rituals include establishing a mini-morning routine to connect before the day begins and sending thoughtful, non-logistical check-in messages. Other key habits are taking individual time to decompress after work, prioritizing a small amount of dedicated "us time" each evening, and ending the day with a brief, quiet emotional check-in. The article suggests these intentional acts can significantly strengthen a couple's bond amidst the chaos of daily life.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, have reportedly docked in geostationary orbit, a maneuver believed to be part of a historic autonomous refueling mission. According to space-tracking firm COMSPOC, the satellites were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations before appearing to merge visually, suggesting a successful docking. This achievement would mark a significant advance in China's space capabilities, demonstrating a sophisticated satellite servicing technology that the United States has not yet accomplished. The operation was reportedly monitored by U.S. surveillance satellites, highlighting the strategic importance of this development.</p>

          <p>This in-depth article reflects on the life and career of Pamela Anderson, arguing she is a more complex and resilient figure than her "Baywatch" persona suggests. It traces her journey from her discovery at a football game to her iconic status, the violation of her stolen private tape, and her recent career renaissance, including a makeup-free public image and a critically noted film role. The piece draws parallels to Marilyn Monroe, highlighting Anderson's vulnerability and strength in navigating public life. It frames her enduring appeal and current relevance as a triumph over decades of public scrutiny and exploitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government plans to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper to purchase in an effort to boost adoption. While not confirming specific details, reports suggest this could involve substantial grants for drivers. The move is a response to the high upfront cost of EVs, which remains a major barrier for many consumers. This initiative is part of a broader £63 million investment in charging infrastructure, including funding for special gullies to help residents without driveways install charge points, as the UK moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>A 54-pound meteorite, confirmed to be the largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Analysis confirmed its origin by matching its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking Mars probe. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet, its sale is a major event for space and natural history collectors.</p>

          <p>Researchers conducting a sonar survey of the Fox River in Wisconsin have accidentally discovered the shipwreck of a vessel that sank over 140 years ago. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society was mapping known cultural sites when they found the unexpected remains of a partially buried ship's hull. Historical records suggest the wreck is likely the L.W. Crane, a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in Oshkosh in 1880. This serendipitous find provides a new window into the region's maritime history, and further investigations are underway to learn more about the vessel.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed an innovative biotransformation system that can convert methanol into sucrose, or common white sugar. Since methanol can be produced from captured carbon dioxide, this method presents a potential pathway for turning greenhouse gases into food. The process, detailed in the journal Science Bulletin, uses enzymes to achieve the conversion and has also been adapted to create other complex carbohydrates like starch. This breakthrough in artificial food synthesis could offer a novel strategy to address both climate change and global food security challenges.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing recognition within the medical community of the significant pain some patients experience during IUD insertion. For years, the discomfort was often minimized, but a rise in patient testimonials on social media has spurred change. Major medical bodies like the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recently issued new recommendations urging doctors to have proactive conversations about pain management. This includes discussing options beyond over-the-counter medication, such as topical anesthetics or nerve blocks, to make the highly effective contraceptive method more tolerable for all patients.</p>

Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is reportedly looking at ways to address the "addictive habits" associated with social media apps and smartphones, with potential proposals including usage caps or curfews. The move comes as Ofcom prepares to enforce the new regulations, which require platforms to filter harmful content from children's feeds.</p>

This method, likely in-situ leaching which avoids traditional tunnels and waste piles, is aimed at exploiting the country's large sandstone-type uranium deposits. The development is positioned as a key step in boosting China's self-sufficiency and competitiveness in the global nuclear energy sector.</p>
