          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing job cuts as part of the DOGE initiative to reduce its workforce by 15%, but assures that these cuts will not affect veterans' healthcare. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Doug Collins stated that frontline healthcare positions will be protected, despite concerns about existing shortages of medical providers. The VA plans to carefully approve deferred resignations for healthcare staff, focusing on increasing productivity and eliminating waste to improve veteran services.

          <p>Hainan, a tropical island province off China's southern coast, is positioning itself as a major shopping destination amid the intensifying trade war with the United States. With its special duty-free policies, Hainan hopes to attract Chinese shoppers seeking cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics. The island is set to launch its own separate customs regime, allowing it to avoid the retaliatory tariffs imposed on American imports, potentially boosting its duty-free stores amid sluggish domestic consumption and the recovery of overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>President Trump agreed to lift the 25 percent tariffs on steel from Britain, providing relief to the struggling British steel industry. The tariffs, imposed earlier in the year, had added costs and complexities to an industry already facing weak demand and high energy costs. However, uncertainties remain regarding products shipped to the U.S. via European Union countries, as well as the long-term stability of trade relations given the Trump administration's impulsive trade policies. The article indicates that while the immediate impact is positive, the future remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at 20 federal agencies, as part of the DOGE initiative led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the administration likely exceeded its legal authority and needs Congressional cooperation to implement such changes. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order, remaining in effect for at least 14 days.</p>
