          <p>A 1,000-pound American bomb from WWII was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, leading to the evacuation of approximately 6,000 residents from 1,900 households. Police described the disposal operation as exceptionally high-risk due to the bomb's size and condition. The device was successfully defused after an operation lasting from Friday night until Saturday morning, with no injuries reported. Such discoveries are not uncommon in the city, which was a target of Allied air raids against Japanese forces during the war.</p>

          <p>Ed Langevin, a retired grandfather, experienced severe heartburn, nausea, and significant weight loss, which doctors eventually diagnosed as chronic mesenteric ischemia, a rare condition caused by blocked arteries restricting blood flow to the small intestine. His condition was described as extreme, causing a severe physical and psychological toll due to the pain and fear associated with eating. Dr. Gabriel Wallace at Northwestern Medicine successfully treated him with a minimally invasive stent procedure, allowing him to return to a normal life. Langevin's story highlights the importance of patient self-advocacy in achieving a correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>

          <p>A group of seven top private technology companies, including OpenAI, SpaceX, Anthropic, and xAI, has seen its collective valuation soar to $1.3 trillion, nearly doubling in the past year. This surge is overwhelmingly driven by the artificial intelligence boom, with AI-focused firms attracting 77% of all private-market capital raised so far this year. The massive availability of private funding reduces the incentive for these companies to go public, allowing them to remain private longer. While OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman has acknowledged being in a "bubble," he also expressed a deep belief in the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the indelible legacy of actor and director Robert Redford, who passed away at age 89, celebrating his iconic screen performances in films like "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" and "All the President's Men." The piece emphasizes that his most lasting impact may be the Sundance Institute and Film Festival, which he founded to support independent and risk-taking filmmakers. Through Sundance, he helped launch the careers of numerous acclaimed directors, including the Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Ava DuVernay. The article concludes that Redford effectively recycled his own success into opportunities for others.</p>

          <h2>Germany Modernizes Funeral Culture with New Laws Allowing River Burials and Home Urns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:57:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saxony-Anhalt have significantly updated their burial laws to reflect changing social attitudes, introducing more personalized options. From October 1, Rhineland-Palatinate will permit river burials in the Rhine and other major rivers and will also allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, both firsts for the country. The new legislation also formally allows the creation of "memorial diamonds" from cremated ashes. These changes, driven by a shift towards cremation and individualized mourning, have been welcomed by undertakers but criticized by Christian churches over concerns about the dignity of remains.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Recommend "20-4-10" Rule to Maintain Affordability When Buying a Car</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help car shoppers avoid overspending, financial planners suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline for affordability. This framework recommends making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price, financing the car for no more than four years (48 months), and ensuring that total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your monthly income. Adhering to these principles can help buyers avoid becoming "underwater" on their loan, where they owe more than the car is worth. While potentially difficult to meet, the rule serves as a strong starting point for budgeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a paradigm for understanding U.S.-China dynamics, contrasting China's "engineering state" with America's "lawyerly society." Wang argues that while China's leadership, dominated by engineers, has achieved remarkable successes in infrastructure and manufacturing, it often prioritizes national power over individual happiness. Conversely, he suggests the U.S. has become physically stagnant and could learn from China's dynamism, even as President Trump adopts some of China's worst authoritarian tendencies. The book challenges readers to consider whether the two restless, imperfect superpowers can learn from each other's strengths.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, formed Wednesday over the central Atlantic. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will remain over open water for several days and strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday.

However, the storm could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island as it continues to intensify.</p>

          <p>For over a decade, Robert Fortunato's remodeled "Green Idea House" in Hermosa Beach, California, has produced more energy than it consumes, demonstrating a model for sustainable living. The project involved replacing all gas appliances with electric ones, powered by 26 rooftop solar panels that also charge two electric cars, eliminating utility bills. Key design features, such as calculated roof overhangs for seasonal shading and an open stairway acting as a "thermal chimney" for cooling, significantly reduce energy needs. Fortunato emphasizes that the remodel used standard materials and off-the-shelf technologies, proving that net-zero energy can be accomplished for less than the cost of traditional construction.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw, widely considered the greatest pitcher of his generation, announced his retirement after an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw was the franchise's guiding light, leading the team through a period of bankruptcy and instability to an era of perennial success, including 13 consecutive postseason berths. His career, marked by three Cy Young Awards and a historically low ERA, bridged the gap between the team's difficult years and its current powerhouse status. On the night after his announcement, the Dodgers clinched another postseason spot, underscoring the culture of winning he helped build.</p>

          <p>A dramatic, youth-led protest movement in Nepal has forced the resignation of the prime minister and led to the appointment of Sushila Karki, the nation's first female prime minister. The upheaval was triggered by months of online campaigns, led by Gen Z activists, exposing alleged corruption and the lavish lifestyles of political elites, which culminated in violent clashes after the government suspended social media. The movement reflects a broader generational shift in South Asia, where young citizens are increasingly challenging established political orders over issues like unemployment and systemic corruption. The new interim government now faces the challenge of restoring order.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like hairy caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are considered both a staple food and a delicacy. Sold in bustling markets in the capital, Kinshasa, these insects provide a vital, organic source of protein and vitamins in a country where traditional meat is often unaffordable for the majority of the population. While Mbinzo can be expensive, the more common Mpose are even being commercially raised by NGOs to supply orphanages with nutritious food. The practice highlights a traditional and sustainable food source that has become increasingly important.</p>

          <p>Prolific television producer David E. Kelley is doubling down on filming in California, keeping all his current and upcoming projects, including "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer," based in the Los Angeles area. Despite industry trends of relocating productions to cheaper states for better tax incentives, Kelley's company chose to stay, a decision reinforced after recent wildfires underscored the need to reinvest in the local community. The move supports hundreds of local crew members and leverages the experienced infrastructure available in Hollywood. The decision was solidified by recent improvements to California's film and TV tax credit program.</p>
