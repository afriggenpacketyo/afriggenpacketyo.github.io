Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that Gabrielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. While its current track keeps it north of the Caribbean islands, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify over open waters.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, significantly strengthening their security partnership. The agreement stipulates that an act of aggression against one nation will be considered an attack on both, aiming to enhance joint deterrence.

The call follows an agreement on a "framework" for the app, whose Chinese parent company, ByteDance, faces a U.S. law requiring it to sell its American operations or face a shutdown. President Trump, who has extended the divestment deadline multiple times, expressed his desire to keep the popular platform operational in the U.S. due to its tremendous value.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris crashed during Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, damaging his car's rear suspension after losing control at Turn Four. The incident occurred at the beginning of a qualifying simulation run, preventing him from participating further in the session and leaving him tenth in the classification. His teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri, also had a brush with the wall but avoided significant damage, finishing 12th. The session adds pressure as Norris aims to close the 31-point championship gap to Piastri.</p>

          <h2>SEC Considers Rule Change Allowing for Semiannual Corporate Earnings Reports</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose a rule change that would allow publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins confirmed the move following a call from President Donald Trump to adopt a six-month schedule to save money and encourage long-term corporate focus. If approved, the change would be optional for companies. Proponents argue it reduces short-term pressure, while opponents raise concerns about decreased transparency for investors, particularly retail investors.</p>

The authors are particularly anticipating a potential large order from China, which could be announced following the president's call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has stated his support for two more interest rate cuts this year, in addition to the one approved by the Federal Open Market Committee this week. He argues that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs is likely a temporary, one-time effect, which provides room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari believes a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations justify further rate reductions to support the economy, even with core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as "tariff hacking" or B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. This model involves routing online sales through a third-party middleman company, which purchases the product at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value. This allows retailers to significantly cut their tariff costs without raising prices for customers. While effective in the short term, some logistics experts warn that this practice is not a sustainable solution for long-term supply chain challenges.</p>
