          <h2>Fitness Expert Outlines Six Core Strength Training Principles for Older Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 09:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fitness expert Marfred Suazo, known as Fonz the Trainer, emphasizes strength training as crucial for older adults to maintain functional fitness and prevent age-related decline. He identifies six core pillars of movement: push, pull, carry, hinge, overhead press, and squat, which target various muscle groups essential for daily activities. Suazo highlights the importance of preserving skeletal muscle, especially for women, to prevent conditions like osteoporosis. He advises beginners to start with fundamentals like calisthenics and resistance bands, gradually increasing intensity, and combining strength training with cardiovascular activity and mobility for overall health.</p>

          <p>A couple chose to radically alter their lives by selling 90% of their possessions and living in ten different cities over two years, instead of following a traditional path. This minimalist and nomadic experience, which included finding short-term rentals and actively avoiding routines, strengthened their relationship and deepened their self-awareness. Surprisingly, they found it financially beneficial, saving money and investing more, enabling them to afford a Brooklyn apartment upon their return. The experience taught them to prioritize living over accumulating, and they plan to embark on similar adventures with their daughter in the future.</p>

          <p>This article refutes the "sickest generation" narrative, particularly challenging claims by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement. It presents evidence of significant health advancements, including a dramatic increase in life expectancy, success against infectious diseases, and improvements in environmental quality. The author highlights how progress in vaccines, antibiotics, and cleaner air/water has made Americans healthier and longer-lived than previous generations. While acknowledging contemporary health issues like obesity and mental illness, the article argues against catastrophizing the present, advocating for building upon public health achievements rather than dismantling the current system.</p>

          <p>British TV presenter Davina McCall has announced her engagement to celebrity hairdresser Michael Douglas after seven years together. The news follows McCall's recent recovery from brain surgery last year, where she had a benign brain tumor removed, which she described as "the hardest thing" she had experienced. Douglas, who supported her through her recovery, had been with her since her divorce was finalized in 2018. This personal milestone marks a positive chapter for McCall, a prominent figure in British television, after a challenging health journey.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management is urging Performance Food Group (PFG) to explore a merger with US Foods, nominating four candidates to PFG's board to push for the combination. Sachem Head, known for its successful activism at US Foods, highlights potential synergies from such a merger, estimated to yield $800 million to $1 billion. While a previous Sysco-US Foods merger was blocked on antitrust grounds, this article argues a PFG-US Foods combination (second and third largest players) might succeed under the current administration. The fund believes this strategic move would create significant long-term value for shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group shares have surged almost 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its stake in mid-August, with the endorsement driving a significant portion of the gains. However, it remains uncertain whether Berkshire's investment is currently profitable on paper, as the exact purchase price within the second quarter is unknown. The article notes that despite the recent rally, the stock is still down 30% year-to-date. Analysts are incrementally positive after meeting with UnitedHealth's management, expressing conviction in a turnaround. Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz shares dipped after reversing a merger Warren Buffett helped organize, causing concerns about Berkshire potentially divesting its stake. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Convenience stores, particularly "food-forward" ones, are increasingly capturing breakfast customers from fast-food chains. While fast-food morning traffic rose only 1% in the past three months, convenience store visits climbed 9%. This shift is attributed to consumers seeking value amid rising menu prices and the wider variety of options offered by c-stores, from coffee and energy drinks to breakfast sandwiches and fresh fruit. Fast-food giants like McDonald's are seeing their breakfast market share decline, prompting them to adapt strategies. The article highlights quality and perceived value as key differentiators for c-stores in this competitive market.</p>

          <p>Tokyo is hosting the World Athletics Championships, marking a return to full spectator attendance after the 2020 Olympics. The event is overshadowed by the World Athletics federation's controversial decision to reimpose mandatory SRY gene testing for female athletes, a policy critics deem unreliable and a spillover from "culture wars." Despite the controversy, 95% of female athletes complied with the testing deadline. On the opening day, Canadian Evan Dunfee won the men's race walk, with Japanese Hayato Katsuki securing bronze to local cheers. The championships are set to run until September 21.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece humorously laments the perceived comeback of skinny jeans, arguing against the cyclical nature of fashion trends driven by industry greed. The author, who personally dislikes jeans and finds skinny styles uncomfortable in his 40s, criticizes fashion media for constantly pushing new versions of clothes people already owned and discarded. He suggests that such trends, like the revival of Sperry boat shoes, are often impractical and contribute to a lack of individual style.
