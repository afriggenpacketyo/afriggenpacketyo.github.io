          <p>President Trump addressed West Point graduates, praising them as the first of a "golden age" for the U.S. military. He highlighted his administration's commitment to national security, border protection, and building in America, including the "Golden Dome" missile defense system. Trump also criticized his predecessors for involving the military in nation-building crusades and praised his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the military academies, including the removal of critical race theory and restrictions on transgender individuals in sports. The speech reflected themes of patriotism, strength, and leadership, while protests took place outside the event.</p>

          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller, "It Was Just an Accident," won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant victory for a director previously banned from leaving Iran. The award was presented by Cate Blanchett, and Panahi received a standing ovation. The win continues Neon's streak of backing Palme d'Or winners. The Cannes closing ceremony followed a power outage suspected to be arson, but power was restored before the stars walked the red carpet.</p>

          <p>French authorities have determined that the power outage in Cannes, which briefly disrupted the film festival, was caused by sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower. Approximately 160,000 homes were affected, but power was restored by late afternoon. The festival quickly switched to backup generators, ensuring the closing ceremony proceeded as planned. Prosecutors have opened investigations into the sabotage, but it is unclear whether the festival was the intended target.</p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film "It Was Just an Accident," despite facing state censorship and imprisonment in the past. The film, which confronts state violence and repression, was shot in secret and features unveiled female characters in defiance of Iran's hijab law. Panahi's win is seen as a triumph over adversity, as he has continued to make award-winning films despite being legally barred from travel and filmmaking. He insists he's simply doing the only thing he knows how.</p>

          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea, aiming to provide habitat for wildlife and control dust pollution. The state began filling a complex of shallow ponds with water, representing its largest effort to address the environmental problems plaguing the Salton Sea. The $200 million project is expected to cover 2,000 acres initially, with plans to expand to over 9,000 acres using additional federal funds. The project aims to create lower-salinity habitats for fish and birds, mitigating the impacts of the lake's increasing salinity.</p>
