          <h2>Jim Cramer Counters Morgan Stanley's Cautious Stance on CrowdStrike Stock</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Morgan Stanley's downgrade of CrowdStrike from "overweight" to "equal weight," CNBC's Jim Cramer voiced his disagreement, suggesting the subsequent dip is a buying opportunity. Morgan Stanley analysts cited the stock's high valuation after a 50% rise since April, indicating that near-term growth appears fully priced in. Cramer, however, remains confident in the cybersecurity firm's long-term potential, particularly anticipating a strong second half as customer package deals from a past IT glitch expire. The discussion highlights the debate between valuation concerns and growth potential for the leading tech company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On Bastille Day, British cyclist Simon Yates secured a victory in stage 10 of the Tour de France after a strategic attack on the final climb. The stage, a grueling 165.3km route through the Massif Central, saw a large breakaway group get significantly reduced. Meanwhile, Ben Healy made history by becoming the first Irish rider in 38 years to wear the coveted yellow jersey, placing him at the top of the general classification. Healy now leads defending champion Tadej Pogacar by 29 seconds as the tour heads into a rest day before resuming.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after the Americans with Disabilities Act, some prospective parents with disabilities still face outright rejection from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a couple with spina bifida who were initially denied by an agency citing their disability as a disqualifying condition. They eventually found an agency that helped them adopt a young girl, Hadley, who also has spina bifida, demonstrating how their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified caregivers. The family's journey underscores the ongoing challenges and prejudices within the adoption system, while also celebrating their successful and loving family formation.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, the joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, announced it will upgrade its Spring Hill, Tennessee, facility to manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells. This move is aimed at producing significantly cheaper electric vehicle batteries, as LFP technology does not require costly minerals like cobalt and nickel found in standard lithium-ion batteries. GM hopes this will help scale the production of more affordable EVs and diversify its portfolio. Commercial production of the new, lower-cost LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027.</p>

          <p>A new provision in the federal spending bill is anticipated to boost the private jet market by reinstating "bonus depreciation," allowing businesses to write off 100% of a jet's purchase price in the first year. This tax benefit, applicable to new and used jets placed in service for business use, is already sparking renewed interest from potential buyers. The stimulus arrives as the private jet industry was experiencing a slowdown from its post-pandemic peak, with rising inventory and longer sale times. Brokers predict a significant spike in purchases, especially toward the end of the year as companies finalize their tax strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage yields, long-term CDs generate substantially more interest over their full term due to the power of compounding time. For example, a $5,000 deposit in a five-year CD could earn over $1,100, whereas a one-year CD would yield around $220. The article advises that the choice depends on an individual's financial goals: long-term for maximizing earnings and short-term for maintaining flexibility amid potential future rate changes.
