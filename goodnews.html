          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, addressing contentious elements related to Medicaid, state and local tax deductions (SALT), and the debt ceiling. The Senate proposes steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes and permanently extending the $10,000 SALT deduction, differing from the House version. House Republicans from blue states have already voiced opposition to the Senate's SALT proposal, threatening the bill's passage in the House. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the legislation before the July 4th recess, potentially keeping senators in Washington, D.C., to meet the deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The California Department of Insurance is investigating State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires, with concerns over how smoke damage claims were managed. Commissioner Ricardo Lara cited inconsistent claims management and inadequate record-keeping as reasons for the investigation. State Farm says they are cooperating with the investigation and have paid out billions to policyholders. The investigation follows a recent approval of a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers, and the department could require State Farm to pay out previously denied claims depending on the results of the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Bar Association is suing the Trump administration, arguing that President Trump's efforts to punish law firms are unconstitutional. The lawsuit targets orders that cut off security clearances and contracts for firms taking on pro bono clients or engaging in diversity practices. The ABA argues that these actions violate the First Amendment and have a "chilling effect," intimidating firms from taking cases opposing the administration's agenda. Several targeted firms have also filed lawsuits, resulting in injunctions from federal judges, while others have struck deals with the administration to avoid targeting.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have introduced legislation to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings during interactions with the public. The proposed bill, SB 627, also requires officers to wear identifying information to ensure transparency and accountability. Exemptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers during natural disasters. The legislation comes amid protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration policies and aims to prevent "secret police behavior."</p>
