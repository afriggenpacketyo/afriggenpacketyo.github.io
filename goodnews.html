          <p>A 34-year-old man and his family saved $60,000 to quit their jobs and move from Ohio to Taipei for 13 months. The primary motivation was to allow their young son to spend meaningful time with his paternal grandparents, who live in Taiwan. The experience proved transformative, leading them to re-evaluate their career priorities, embrace a happier life on a lower income, and even welcome a new child born during their stay. The family found the time abroad essential for personal growth and strengthening family bonds.</p>

Coming on as a second-half substitute, he quickly influenced the game by drawing a penalty that led to the tying goal in a 2-2 draw. Son expressed slight disappointment in not securing a win but was touched by the warm welcome he received from fans, a contrast to the hostile receptions often seen in away games. His move is highly anticipated to resonate with Los Angeles's large Korean community.</p>

          <p>As generative AI empowers cyberattackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly recruiting AI agents for their defense teams. These autonomous AI "teammates" are used to automate routine tasks, analyze threats, and handle alerts, freeing up human cybersecurity professionals to focus on more complex issues. This shift is seen as a necessary response to the rising scale of AI-driven attacks and helps address the talent shortage in the cybersecurity field. Experts view this as an augmentation of human capabilities rather than a replacement, improving efficiency in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</p>

          <p>The rapid rise of artificial intelligence is creating personal wealth faster than any previous tech wave, minting dozens of new billionaires this year. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Anysphere have achieved massive valuations through blockbuster fundraising, creating vast paper fortunes for their founders and early employees. While much of this wealth is illiquid and concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, it is fueling a local economic boom and transforming the city's real estate market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen states are holding sales tax holidays in 2025, offering temporary relief by waiving state and sometimes local sales tax on specific items. These events are politically popular, often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, and can help families facing higher costs due to inflation and tariffs. However, tax experts note that the benefits are often limited, as consumers may simply shift the timing of planned purchases, and wealthier households with more spending flexibility can benefit most. For maximum savings, shoppers are advised to combine the tax holiday with store promotions.</p>

Researchers at the University of Georgia identified the rock as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite, which originates from the early solar system. The event marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, with experts noting that modern technology is helping to find them more frequently.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new tax bill creating a federal tax deduction for tip income has been met with a mix of hope and skepticism from service industry workers. The measure provides a deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income from 2025 through 2028, but some workers are unclear on the details, with many not realizing it doesn't eliminate state or payroll taxes. Key questions remain about which occupations and types of gratuities will qualify, with the IRS expected to provide clarification. The proposal comes as tipping averages have slightly declined.

The piece supports NASA's recent directive to place a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor on the lunar surface, arguing it is essential for sustaining a settlement through the long, frigid lunar nights. The author frames the effort as a geopolitical necessity to counter Chinese lunar ambitions, which also include a powerful nuclear reactor. A lunar base is presented as a potential global commons for research, such as hosting radio telescopes.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California water agencies are planning for a more resilient future. The Metropolitan Water District is pursuing major investments in local sources, including an $8 billion project to recycle wastewater, which could eventually supply half a million homes. The goal is to create a diversified portfolio including recycled water, stormwater capture, and possibly desalination to avoid a "Day Zero" crisis where taps run dry. These costly projects aim to ensure long-term sustainability while keeping water affordable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities like Los Angeles grapple with intensifying floods and droughts, some urban planners are advocating for the "sponge city" model, which uses nature-based solutions to absorb and manage stormwater. Pioneered in China and implemented in cities like Bangkok, this approach replaces impermeable concrete with green infrastructure like parks and wetlands. These spaces capture and filter rainwater, replenishing groundwater and reducing strain on drainage systems, while also providing recreational benefits. Los Angeles County has begun funding such projects, but progress is slow and costly, highlighting the challenges of retrofitting a metropolis.</p>
