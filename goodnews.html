          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in Washington, aiming to conclude decades of conflict. The agreement calls for the disarmament of armed groups in eastern DR Congo, a region rich in minerals vital for electronics. Despite skepticism due to the failure of past deals and ambiguity over the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, U.S. and Congolese leaders have hailed it as a significant diplomatic achievement. Key details regarding the M23 rebels and the return of refugees remain unspecified pending the full release of the treaty's terms.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed at all-time highs, continuing a recent market surge despite ongoing geopolitical and trade concerns. The S&P 500 has climbed over 20% since an April low, fueled by cautious investor optimism regarding eased tariff policies and signs of a healthy economy. While a sudden termination of trade talks with Canada caused a brief dip, the market recovered, demonstrating resilience. Recent data shows inflation remains relatively low and hiring is sturdy, contributing to the positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial advisor Ric Edelman now suggests that investment portfolios should allocate between 10% to 40% to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage. He attributes this shift to the maturation of crypto into a mainstream asset, with regulatory questions being resolved and institutional adoption growing via products like Bitcoin ETFs. Edelman also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, necessitating assets like crypto for higher potential returns.

          <p>Brentford has turned down an improved offer from Manchester United for forward Bryan Mbeumo, valued at ¬£55 million plus ¬£7.5 million in add-ons. This is the second bid rejected by the club, following an earlier offer of ¬£45 million plus add-ons. Brentford is reportedly seeking a higher guaranteed fee for the 25-year-old Cameroon international, who scored 20 goals last season. United is seeking to bolster its attack, but may face competition from other clubs, including Tottenham, for Mbeumo's signature.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its food products by the end of 2027. This includes items like sugar-free jams, ice cream toppings, and some products from its recently acquired Hostess brand, such as Twinkies. The company stated that the majority of its portfolio, including Uncrustables, is already free from synthetic dyes. This move aligns Smucker with other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar pledges amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial food additives.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom and industry leaders hope the expanded program will bring productions back to California and revitalize the local industry. A related bill is also advancing to broaden eligibility and increase credit percentages to make the state more competitive.</p>

          <p>The HBO mockumentary series "The Comeback," starring Lisa Kudrow, is set to return for a final season in 2026, two decades after its initial premiere. The show, which follows the journey of washed-up sitcom star Valerie Cherish, was canceled after its first season in 2005 but returned for a second in 2014, building a cult following. Created by Kudrow and Michael Patrick King, the series has earned critical acclaim and two Emmy nominations for Kudrow's performance. The upcoming season will see the return of most of the original cast, continuing the story of Cherish's persistent quest for relevance.</p>

This change follows the reopening of Israeli airspace after a ceasefire ended a 12-day conflict with Iran. The Foreign Office announced that a final evacuation flight for British nationals is scheduled for the weekend, as commercial flight options have become available again. The government still advises against all travel to Gaza and specific areas in northern Israel and the West Bank, acknowledging the situation remains fragile.</p>

          <p>The new independent film "Ponyboi," written by and starring River Gallo, shines a light on the intersex experience through the story of a Latine sex worker in New Jersey. The film, which evolved from Gallo's USC thesis project, is the first feature produced by Fox Entertainment's indie label, Tideline. Gallo, who is intersex, uses the narrative to explore themes of trauma, identity, and the search for freedom and self-acceptance. The project aims to provide much-needed visibility for the intersex community, whose stories are often invisible in mainstream culture and are impacted by anti-trans legislation.</p>

          <p>Crypto exchange Coinbase has become the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for the month of June, surging over 40%. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts also point to the market undervaluing Coinbase's lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, some experts believe the stock has further room to grow as legislative clarity and institutional adoption of crypto continue to evolve.
