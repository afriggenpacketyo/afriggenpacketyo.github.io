          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea (BOK), maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, a move consistent with market expectations. This decision primarily aims to further assess the impact on Seoul's housing prices and manage household debt, which have been areas of concern. Despite this cautious stance, the BOK upgraded its inflation forecast for 2025 to 2% and its GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, driven by anticipated modest recovery in domestic demand and recent trade agreements with the U.S. However, the bank also noted potential headwinds from expanding U.S. tariffs impacting exports.

          <p>Former Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan has issued a call for caution regarding stablecoins, advocating for a "multidimensional assessment" of their utility and potential systemic risks. Speaking at a China Finance 40 Forum seminar, Zhou warned against the dangers of stablecoins being excessively used for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and instability within the financial system. He expressed concern that some industry players might leverage hype for valuation boosts rather than sustainable business models. This advice comes as global regulators, including the U.S. and Hong Kong, develop frameworks, and China considers yuan-backed stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demands from former U.S. President Donald Trump. However, a new report reveals that only three nations—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the alliance's recently agreed-upon new goal of 3.5%. While the U.S. contributes the most in absolute terms, its spending is estimated at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the need to convert funds into tangible military capability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, projecting over 50% sales growth this quarter, underscoring sustained demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company's data center business continues to drive its performance, with its finance chief anticipating $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Despite these strong results, Nvidia's stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading due to data center revenue falling marginally short of estimates for the second consecutive period. The article also noted no H20 chip shipments to China during the quarter, although inventory was released to other markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison, finally fulfilling a campaign promise after a significant two-and-a-half-year delay. Kang, supported by Dan Halden and Amy Goldberg, will serve as the primary contact for film and TV productions, helping them navigate city bureaucracy. This appointment addresses long-standing frustrations from industry advocates, especially as Los Angeles faces a decline in production jobs due to competition from other states and countries offering generous tax incentives. The move aims to streamline local processes and support the city's signature entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government is significantly expanding its free childcare program, offering 30 hours a week for working parents of children aged nine months to four years in England from September. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson encouraged eligible parents to apply for this final phase of the expansion. Despite a reported decrease in average nursery costs, concerns remain widespread regarding the sufficiency of staff and childcare places, especially in underserved "childcare deserts." Additionally, extra fees charged by some providers mean a quarter of parents struggle to access the "free" hours. The Department for Education aims to address these shortfalls by creating thousands of new staff and places.</p>

          <h2>Value of Small Parcels from China to UK More Than Doubles Amid Tax Exemption Debate</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels from China to the UK, benefiting from an import tax exemption, has surged to £3 billion last year, more than doubling its previous figure. This increase is largely attributed to the rising popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu, with these low-value imports now comprising 51% of all small parcels entering the UK. While the UK government is reviewing the £135 customs duty exemption, domestic businesses and industry groups are pressing for immediate action. They argue the exemption creates unfair competition for High Street retailers and raises concerns about unregulated product safety. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The charity Greater Change is reporting success with its direct cash assistance program, which provides money to individuals at risk of or experiencing homelessness, emphasizing "dignity of choice." This year, the initiative has distributed £699,000 to 403 people, who typically use the funds for essential needs like rent deposits, bills, or debt repayment. Though operating on a smaller scale, the charity contends its early intervention model saves taxpayers substantial amounts by preventing chronic homelessness. Both international and UK studies corroborate the effectiveness of direct cash transfers, indicating recipients make responsible financial decisions and improve their housing stability and employment outcomes.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is rapidly transforming the global automotive market, with its unprecedented speed and scale catching many, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, by surprise. Domestic giants like BYD have surpassed Tesla in revenue, propelled by extensive government subsidies, tax incentives, and significant development investments. China became the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023, with EVs comprising 41% of its record domestic sales. Analysts forecast China will produce 36 million vehicles annually by 2030, exporting 9 million. This burgeoning dominance has triggered regulatory scrutiny and tariffs from Western markets, as Chinese EV manufacturers increasingly invest in global production facilities.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has dismissed fears of an impending artificial intelligence (AI) bubble, arguing that the substantial AI investments by major tech companies are justified, particularly in light of Nvidia's strong earnings report. Although Nvidia's stock saw a slight dip in extended trading due to extremely high expectations and a minor miss in data center revenue, Cramer maintained a positive outlook on the quarter. He drew comparisons to the dot-com era, highlighting how resilient companies like Amazon ultimately achieved immense success despite the market crash. Cramer underscored the strong leadership and solid financial health of current AI hyperscalers. (not investment advice)</p>
