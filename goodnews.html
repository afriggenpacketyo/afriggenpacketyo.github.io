          <h2>UK Education Officials Stress Importance of First-Week School Attendance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 03:24:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data from the 2024-25 school year in England reveals a strong correlation between first-week attendance and overall school presence. Over half of pupils who were partially absent in the first week became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of the term, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance initially. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged parents and schools to prioritize getting children in from the start of the new term to combat high absence levels, which have remained elevated since the pandemic. The government is implementing support hubs, though unions argue a more comprehensive strategy is needed to address the root causes of absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England defender Millie Bright has spoken about her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad, calling it the "best decision I have ever made." The 32-year-old captain cited the need for a mental and physical break after a demanding season where she led her club to a domestic treble. Bright revealed she felt on the verge of a breakdown and recognized she couldn't perform at her best, prompting her to prioritize her well-being over pleasing others. After undergoing knee surgery and starting counseling, she now feels "back to life" and prepared for the upcoming Women's Super League season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative experiment near the California-Oregon border, biologists are using drones to protect livestock from gray wolves. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative, nonlethal method is part of an ongoing effort to find ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist. While initial results show success in scaring wolves away, the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, as wolves can become habituated to deterrents. The high cost of the technology also presents a barrier for widespread adoption by ranchers.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 fan, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking a personal challenge to attend all 24 grands prix of the current season on a budget of £20,000. The journey, which spans five continents and 21 countries, is being funded by his personal savings and managed around his 28 days of annual leave from his full-time job. By documenting his travels and cost-saving strategies, such as staying in capsule hostels, Burgess hopes to demonstrate that following the sport globally can be more accessible than its glamorous reputation suggests. With the expensive flyaway races still to come, he acknowledges the budget will be tight but remains determined to complete his dream.</p>

          <p>A series of nationwide protests themed "Workers over Billionaires" are scheduled for Labor Day, with numerous locations planned across the Los Angeles area. The demonstrations aim to challenge what organizers describe as efforts by billionaires to cut healthcare, scapegoat immigrants, and divide working people for profit. The planned actions follow a period of increased pressure on unions, which are contending with challenges from the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor relations. Rallies and marches are scheduled in multiple L.A. neighborhoods, including Westchester, Culver City, Torrance, and Wilmington, continuing the tradition of labor activism on the federal holiday.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held significant talks on the sidelines of the SCO summit, marking Modi's first visit to China in seven years. Both leaders expressed a commitment to improving bilateral ties based on mutual respect, with Xi emphasizing the need for the "dragon and the elephant" to be good neighbors. The meeting occurs as both nations face economic pressure from steep US tariffs, creating a shared incentive to strengthen their relationship and diversify trade partnerships. Analysts suggest this could be a pivotal moment for the two Asian powers to find common ground and reshape regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime secured a major upset at the US Open, defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set thriller. After dropping the first set, the 25th seed mounted a strong comeback, winning a crucial second-set tiebreak that shifted the match's momentum. Zverev, a former US Open runner-up, grew visibly frustrated as his performance declined, leading to his earliest exit from the tournament since 2018. For Auger-Aliassime, the victory marks a significant return to form after seasons hampered by injuries and represents his first Grand Slam win over a top-five opponent, advancing him to the fourth round.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the sixth time the grand prize has reached the billion-dollar threshold in the game's history. While nine tickets nationwide won $1 million by matching the five white balls, the top prize has continued to grow since it was last won on May 31. The next drawing on Monday night will offer a winner the choice of an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $498.4 million before taxes. The largest Powerball jackpot ever was $2.04 billion, won in 2022.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has stated his ambition for his network to handle more transaction volume than the SWIFT international payment system within the next five years. He highlighted that Tron is already projected to facilitate US$8 trillion in transactions this year, primarily through stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Sun emphasized Tron's speed, processing transactions in seconds compared to SWIFT's multi-day timeline, as a key advantage. He believes the platform's efficiency could allow it to scale and eventually handle transaction volumes many times larger than the current global standard. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans started their 2025 football season with an overwhelming 73-13 victory against Missouri State at the Coliseum. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The offense was explosive, averaging over 10 yards per play and scoring on multiple long touchdowns, while the defense registered five sacks and a pick-six. The lopsided score, the most points USC has scored since 1930, allowed the team to give significant playing time to backups, including five-star freshman quarterback Husan Longstreet, who played the entire second half in the comfortable win.</p>
