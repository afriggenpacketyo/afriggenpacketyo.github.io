          <p>Oakland Athletics outfielder Brent Rooker humorously responded on social media to an ESPN reporter's suggested lineup for the MLB All-Star game's inaugural swing-off, which had excluded him. The reporter, Jeff Passan, had listed several power-hitting stars he would have preferred to see compete. Rooker jokingly asked if he wasn't "good enough" before clarifying he was not genuinely upset and would have made the same picks. The article also notes another instance of Rooker engaging with critics on social media, defending his choice to feed his young daughter a bottle during the Home Run Derby.</p>

          <p>Ten Americans, including former Navy SEAL Wilbert Joseph Castaneda, have been freed from Venezuelan custody and are returning to the United States. Their release was part of a complex prisoner swap involving the U.S., Venezuela, and El Salvador. The deal saw El Salvador repatriate 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison. In exchange, Venezuela also released dozens of its own political prisoners. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free, crediting President Trump's leadership for the outcome.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, who were deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador in March, have been sent to Venezuela. This move was part of a broader prisoner exchange that also secured the release of 10 Americans held in Venezuela. The Trump administration had used a rare 18th-century law to deport the migrants, accusing them of gang ties, a claim many families and an ACLU lawyer contest. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele confirmed the exchange, which also included the release of Venezuelan political prisoners, framing it as a resolution to a complex international situation.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent trip to China, where he met with Premier Li Qiang and business leaders, demonstrates Canberra's strategy of navigating its relationships with both the U.S. and China. This diplomatic engagement is seen as a "stiffening of Canberra's spine" against U.S. pressure to take a harder line on Beijing. Analysts note that Australia, like other nations in the region, faces a predicament in balancing its major economic partnership with China and its crucial security alliance with the United States. The approach acknowledges that making a binary choice between the two global powers is not a realistic or beneficial option for the country.</p>

          <p>Despite being an early pioneer in artificial intelligence research, Meta is now effectively starting over in the race to build advanced AI, trailing competitors like OpenAI and Google. The company has launched a new division, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), and is reportedly spending billions on data centers and offering massive compensation packages to recruit top talent. This strategic pivot comes after its flagship Llama models struggled to compete and its bet on open-source AI failed to establish industry dominance. The renewed push, led by a new Chief AI Officer, aims to build "personal superintelligence for everyone," though its ultimate goal may be to better integrate AI into its existing social media products.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged more than 10% in after-hours trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 typically boosts a company's stock price, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase the shares to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down for the year, Block's addition reflects the increasing weight of the technology sector in the benchmark index and marks a significant milestone for the company.

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has officially filed a motion asking a federal judge to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. The request covers proceedings from both the 2019 New York sex trafficking case and the investigation into his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. This legal move is a direct response to immense public pressure and backlash from the president's own supporters after a recent DOJ memo concluded there was no "client list." The final decision rests with the presiding judges, and the process of redacting victim information means any release could take weeks or months.</p>

Microsoft's chief communications officer stated the company is committed to providing secure services and will adjust security protocols as needed in partnership with national security agencies.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a strong majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly high among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo missions. The survey also found that the 1969 moon landing is still viewed as a worthwhile achievement by a large majority, consistent with views from previous anniversaries. Americans generally believe the space program contributes to national pride and produces technological benefits for everyone, showing broad, bipartisan backing for continued space exploration.</p>

          <p>The stock of online real estate company Opendoor surged nearly 190% in one week, largely driven by the enthusiastic social media posts of hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had taken a new position in the beaten-down stock, predicted it could be a "100-bagger" in the coming years. The rally occurred despite no fundamental improvements in the company's business, which remains a cash-burning operation. The story highlights the growing influence of social media on stock prices and how Jackson, who nearly shut down his fund in 2022, is leveraging a successful past bet on Carvana to build a reputation for identifying comeback opportunities.

His remarks have temporarily eased fears that the Trump administration would push to sell off the mail agency.
