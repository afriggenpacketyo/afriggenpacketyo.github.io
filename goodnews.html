          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by a New Jersey judge, prevents the government from deporting or detaining Khalil, a green card holder who was detained in March. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests, with the judge stating that Khalil's career and speech are being irreparably harmed. The judge is giving the government a chance to appeal, but this marks a setback for the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of criminal sexual assault against Miriam Haley in his retrial, while the jury found him not guilty of criminal sexual assault regarding Kaja Sokola. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of third degree sexual assault involving Jessica Mann and deliberations will continue. The jury foreperson reported infighting among jurors and an alleged threat, leading to defense attorneys requesting a mistrial, which was denied. Despite the partial verdict, accusers and their attorneys expressed satisfaction that Weinstein was held accountable, with Haley stating the verdict gives her hope for a new awareness around sexual violence.</p>
