        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta Platforms is signaling a more cautious approach to its open-source AI strategy, which contrasts with China's rapid advancements in the field. This shift comes as experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem is helping it gain on the US in AI development. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Zhipu AI have recently released powerful new open-source models, claiming top performance benchmarks. Meta's Llama family has been a major proponent of open-source AI, but this change in direction suggests a strategic pivot in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>An annual cleanup event at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado resulted in the collection of 780 pounds of trash and lost items. Staff members discovered a range of unusual objects, including an old iPod Nano, a hamburger flipper, and a message in a bottle containing a COVID-19 vaccination card. The resort noted that while many items were trash, larger pieces were recycled or upcycled, and in rare cases, valuables like an engagement ring have been reunited with their owners. The effort highlights the importance of preserving natural spaces shared with wildlife, as employees also encountered a family of moose.</p>

The victory demonstrates her remarkable versatility and patience as she continues to explore the 400m flat.

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released after two months in ICE detention. She was detained in May during what was supposed to be a routine green card interview, despite having recently given birth and being a nursing mother. Her case drew attention to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement, which has seen a significant increase in arrests. After advocacy from her husband, her attorney, and the office of Senator John Kennedy, she was released on bond and is now reunited with her family, though she still faces further immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has finally been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gesture but died just before arriving in England. For decades, it was rumored that the creature died from shock due to a nearby German U-boat attack. However, recent archival research by students and museum staff reveals that the platypus likely succumbed to overheating, as ship logs show water temperatures in its enclosure rose well above the safe threshold for the species while crossing the equator.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes competition is underway at the New Orleans Saints training camp, where two Australian punters, Matt Hayball and James Burnip, are battling for one lucrative NFL contract. This reflects a trend for the Saints, who have consistently favored Australian punters for their versatile skills developed in Australian rules football. Despite the cut-throat nature of the situation, where the loser will be unemployed, the two maintain a friendly camaraderie. Both athletes are graduates of the ProKick Australia academy, which has become a major pipeline for sending former Aussie rules players to American football.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris's announcement that she will not run for governor of California has reset the race, leaving no clear front-runner among the remaining candidates. With Harris out, candidates like former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter and U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra are vying to build momentum and secure donor support. However, political strategists note that none of the current contenders possess significant statewide name recognition, making fundraising and campaign messaging critical in the wide-open field. Endorsements, such as Nancy Pelosi's backing of Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, are also expected to play a key role.</p>

          <p>England is facing a monumental task in the final Test against India, needing to chase a target of 374 runs to win the series. The challenge is compounded by the loss of key all-rounder Ben Stokes to injury and a condensed, grueling series schedule that has taken a toll on both teams. England's depleted fast-bowling unit, including a lion-hearted effort from Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue, has struggled to contain India. This article analyzes the strategic decisions and player fatigue that have backed England into a corner, with a historic victory or a drawn series hanging in the balance.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to more openly acknowledge its role in the genocide of Sinti and Roma people during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country's public discourse. At a recent commemoration event, Romania's new president and other officials emphasized the need to confront history and combat ongoing racism and right-wing extremism. During the war, Romania, allied with Nazi Germany, deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most perished. The renewed focus on this history, including new school curricula, is seen as a crucial step toward addressing deep-rooted discrimination.</p>

Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on Ethereum, integrating it into their core systems. Founder Vitalik Buterin and other experts reflect on its growth from a cypherpunk ideal to an invisible backbone for Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>
