        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is set to begin importing iron ore from Guinea and Algeria this year, marking a significant development in global resource supply chains. For years, logistical challenges, specifically the lack of railway infrastructure, hindered these African nations from exporting their vast iron ore deposits. The completion of new railway lines and port facilities by Chinese firms has now unlocked these resources, with Guinea's Simandou mine expected to start shipments in November. This infrastructure development will connect major mining sites, like the Gara Djebilet mine in Algeria, to Mediterranean ports, boosting trade and resource access for Beijing.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions in their upcoming match against a First Nations and Pasifika XV in Melbourne. This will be Farrell's first start on the tour, playing at inside centre in a lineup that excludes players from the first-Test victory over Australia. The squad for this game features nine Scottish players and all "geography players," who were called up as cover. While the game's relevance to the main Test series is limited, it offers opportunities for players like Blair Kinghorn and Farrell to contend for spots in the primary team for the second Test.</p>

          <h2>Analysts View Singapore Dollar as an Emerging Safe-Haven Currency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Singapore dollar (SGD) is increasingly being recognized for its safe-haven characteristics, particularly during periods of financial stress in Asia. Analysts point to Singapore's strong institutional framework, resilient economy, and prudent policymaking as key factors bolstering the currency's stability. While it doesn't yet have the global status of the US dollar or Japanese yen, the SGD has strengthened significantly against a weakening greenback. Hurdles to becoming a top-tier safe haven include the relatively small size of its market and a managed exchange rate policy that, while ensuring stability, limits liquidity and large-scale speculation.

          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a dominant force across China's entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded its focus from telecommunications to a wide range of sectors including AI chips, data centers, smart cars, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to Nvidia. U.S. sanctions inadvertently pushed Huawei to become a national champion, receiving state backing to develop a full suite of AI hardware and software. Its Ascend series of AI chips and its "CANN" software ecosystem are now seen as viable alternatives to American technology, particularly within China and allied nations.</p>

          <p>The northeastern Chinese city of Hegang, known for its industrial decline and shrinking population, is investing in a new airport as part of a strategy to revitalize its economy. Construction on Luobei Airport, a 1.2 billion yuan project, is set to begin soon with an expected opening in 2027. The city's population has fallen significantly, and its GDP has decreased in recent years. Officials hope the new airport, designed to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually, will improve connectivity, boost trade with Russia, and attract new opportunities to the struggling rust-belt region.

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison. His gang is blamed for a surge in violence that has transformed Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition, supported by a recent referendum, is part of President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on crime and marks a significant step in the country's fight against powerful criminal organizations.</p>

          <p>A new class of weight loss and diabetes drugs, known as GLP-1s, is showing potential as a breakthrough treatment for women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder, often experience symptoms like irregular periods, infertility, and metabolic issues, and many have reported significant improvements after using these medications. Researchers believe the drugs help by improving insulin sensitivity and promoting weight loss, which in turn can help regulate hormones and alleviate symptoms. While more research is needed and insurance coverage remains a hurdle, the development offers new hope for managing the complex condition.</p>

Strong second-quarter corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone.

Other drivers include massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, a re-shoring of manufacturing, and an anticipated increase in bank lending, all of which could fuel further economic growth.
