          <p>Following two days of high-level trade negotiations in Stockholm, the United States and China have agreed to extend a temporary pause on implementing new tariffs against each other. While no major breakthroughs were announced, the agreement prevents an immediate escalation of the trade conflict between the world's two largest economies. During this extension period, which was not given a specific duration, both nations have committed to refraining from imposing additional tariffs or taking other measures that would intensify the trade dispute. This development provides a window for further dialogue and attempts to resolve underlying economic disagreements.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Reports Reduced Losses and Increased Sales in Positive Turnaround Signal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 11:48:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing has demonstrated signs of a potential recovery, reporting significantly reduced quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue, driven by its highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year" for the aerospace giant, which has faced numerous crises. The company's adjusted losses were smaller than analysts had predicted, and it burned through substantially less cash than in the previous year. While challenges remain, including delayed certifications for new 737 Max models, the improved production and delivery figures suggest the company is stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a four-day visit to Scotland, U.S. President Donald Trump met with First Minister John Swinney to discuss several key issues, including U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky and the ongoing humanitarian situation in Gaza. Swinney appealed to the president to seek an exemption for Scotch whisky, a vital Scottish export, from the 10% tariff. The leaders also discussed energy policy, with Trump criticizing wind turbines and advocating for North Sea oil and gas exploitation. The meeting, which took place at Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort, was part of a visit combining business interests with diplomatic discussions.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-line transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to connect Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks across 22 eastern states. Proponents argue the consolidation would streamline national shipping and improve delivery times by eliminating handoffs between rail companies. However, the landmark deal is expected to face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about competition and the potential for service disruptions that have plagued past rail mergers.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and a surge in U.S. imports as firms moved to preempt higher taxes. The organization now projects global growth of 3.0% in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026, an increase from its April predictions. Despite the upgrade, the IMF warned that the global economy remains below its pre-pandemic average growth rate and that escalating tariffs could still weaken economic activity. The report also noted that UK growth is expected to be among the fastest of advanced economies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card credit card portfolio from Goldman Sachs. The move would mark Goldman's exit from a high-profile but challenging venture into consumer credit, which faced regulatory scrutiny and concerns over potential loan losses. For JPMorgan, already the largest U.S. credit card issuer, acquiring the Apple Card business would further solidify its dominance in the market. According to sources, other potential bidders like American Express and Synchrony are no longer in contention, positioning JPMorgan as the likely new partner for Apple's popular credit card program.</p>

          <p>Consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble reported quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance from brands like Tide and Charmin. However, the company issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, forecasting a potential $1 billion pretax hit from increased costs associated with tariffs. P&G's CFO stated that while some of this impact can be offset through productivity, a portion will be passed to consumers via price increases on about a quarter of its products. The guidance reflects ongoing economic volatility and a more selective consumer spending environment. (not investment advice)</p>

To combat fire risks from heat and drought, Deutsche Bahn is testing new vegetation management techniques and using AI to monitor potentially hazardous trees.

Instead, savers should proactively compare options during the grace period after a CD matures. Alternatives to consider include opening a new CD with a different term or at a different institution, moving the funds to a more liquid high-yield savings account, or investing the money elsewhere, depending on individual financial goals and liquidity needs.

This modern genetic analysis confirms long-held archaeological theories, based on figurines and grave goods, that women held an elevated position in this ancient community.
