The company manages $88.2 billion in assets for 1.3 million customers, demonstrating significant scale, and reported a net income of $194.4 million on $308.9 million in revenue during fiscal 2025. This public offering comes after a planned $1.4 billion acquisition by UBS collapsed in 2022, indicating a robust recovery and renewed investor interest in the fintech sector.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Michael Friedman as his new chief of staff, a decision confirmed by two sources familiar with the matter. Friedman previously played a key role in selecting staff for the Treasury Department through the White House Office of Presidential Personnel during President Trump's second term. Bessent stated that Friedman's transition from staffing to management is natural, and he will be instrumental in advancing President Trump's America First Economic Agenda. Friedman, who holds degrees from NYU and Harvard Law, replaces Dan Katz, who is moving to the International Monetary Fund as first deputy managing director.</p>

          <p>Europe claimed a 15-13 victory in the 45th Ryder Cup, despite a strong final-day comeback from the U.S., highlighting Europe's superior team culture, planning, and strategic execution. The article critically assesses U.S. captain Keegan Bradley's self-centered leadership and flawed course setup decisions, which ultimately backfired on his team. In contrast, European captain Luke Donald emphasized a collective effort, supported by a highly experienced backroom team of strategists and statisticians. The European team's unity and disciplined approach, even amidst a hostile crowd, proved to be a decisive factor in their success.</p>

          <p>Walmart CEO Doug McMillon asserts that artificial intelligence will "literally change every job," urging workers across all sectors to prepare for adaptation. Walmart plans to freeze its global headcount for the next three years, anticipating that AI adoption will drive future revenue growth, with white-collar office jobs expected to be among the first affected. McMillon advises employees to "get plussed up" by familiarizing themselves with new AI tools to enhance efficiency and productivity. While AI will handle many tasks, human soft skills like communication and critical thinking will remain invaluable, particularly in customer-facing roles.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, the celebrated songwriter and singer behind the iconic "Love Is All Around" theme for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," shares insights from his extensive music career. He was an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, witnessing the genesis of rock 'n' roll and serving as a pallbearer after Holly's tragic death in 1959. Curtis later joined The Crickets and penned enduring hits like "Walk Right Back" and "I Fought the Law," which have been covered by numerous artists. Now 84, Curtis remains disarmingly humble, offering wisdom gleaned from a career spanning decades of musical innovation and lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>San Diego Democrat Toni Atkins, a former state Senate leader, has officially withdrawn from the 2026 California governor's race, citing a lack of a "viable path forward to victory." Atkins, who achieved historical milestones as the first out LGBTQ+ person to hold top legislative posts, was a strong advocate for affordable housing and reproductive rights. Her departure contributes to a broader reshuffling within the crowded Democratic field, which some hope will help unite the party against potential high-profile Republican challengers. Recent polls had shown Atkins with single-digit support, lagging behind other prominent candidates.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 53, an AI transparency bill designed to establish "commonsense guardrails" for large artificial intelligence companies. The new legislation mandates public disclosure of security protocols, comprehensive risk evaluations, and the reporting of critical safety incidents to the state’s Office of Emergency Services. It also significantly strengthens whistleblower protections for employees who report violations, and grants the Attorney General the authority to levy civil penalties of up to $1 million against non-compliant companies. Newsom emphasized that the bill strikes a crucial balance between fostering innovation and ensuring public safety and transparency.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced new parental controls for teen ChatGPT accounts, empowering parents to manage various aspects of their children's chatbot usage. These controls allow parents to set specific usage hours, disable voice mode, and prevent chat history from being saved or utilized for model training purposes. The update also includes notifications for potential self-harm signs, with a specialist team reviewing alerts and contacting parents or, in imminent threats, law enforcement. These changes follow recent lawsuits alleging chatbots encouraged self-harm, aiming to provide a safer, age-appropriate experience, and OpenAI is developing an age prediction system for all users.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating flooding, professional whitewater raft guides in eastern Tennessee are leading a significant cleanup effort on the Nolichucky River. The hurricane's remnants caused thousands of years of geological change and deposited substantial debris, including railroad tracks and parts of houses, forcing most rafting companies to cease operations. Through state-funded relief grants, guides are now employed to remove trash, car parts, and household items from the riverbanks. They hope to reopen access points for the 2026 season, viewing this extensive restoration as an opportunity for the river's rebirth and community healing.</p>
