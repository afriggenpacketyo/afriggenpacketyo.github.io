The company quickly identified the mistake and burned the excess tokens within approximately 20 minutes, assuring the public that no security breach occurred and customer funds remained safe. This incident highlights the operational risks in the stablecoin market, as the mistakenly minted amount far exceeds global GDP, underscoring that the token's dollar peg relies on institutional backing rather than the minting process itself.

          <p>Ali Riley, the 37-year-old captain of New Zealand's national soccer team and Angel City FC, is retiring after a distinguished career that includes five World Cups and four Olympics. Her decision follows a difficult year marked by a chronic nerve injury that left her unable to walk for months, undergoing IVF treatment, and losing her childhood home in a fire. Riley has been a vocal advocate for more support and discussion around motherhood in professional sports, encouraging athletes to consider freezing their eggs earlier in their careers. Despite the hardships, she reflects positively on her career, especially on leading New Zealand to its first-ever World Cup victory on home soil in 2023.</p>

Officials emphasize the "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" technique as the best response to shaking, as studies show moving around or running outside increases the risk of injury from falling debris. The article also provides crucial preparedness tips, including securing heavy furniture, having an emergency kit, and retrofitting older homes that are vulnerable to collapse. Residents are also encouraged to download the MyShake app, which can provide critical seconds of warning before shaking begins.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating PTSD, depression, and traumatic brain injury, particularly among military veterans. The legislation, sponsored by the nonprofit Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS), streamlines the approval process by targeting California's Research Advisory Panel, which adds an extra layer of review for studies already approved by the FDA. Under the new law, compliant, FDA-approved studies involving Schedule 1 drugs can receive state approval more quickly. This move is celebrated by advocates who credit therapies like ibogaine with saving lives and offering hope where conventional treatments have failed.</p>

          <h2>French Prime Minister Survives No-Confidence Vote After Pledging to Suspend Pension Reform</h2>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, narrowly avoiding the collapse of his week-old government. The motion, brought by the hard-left France Unbowed party, failed to secure the 289 votes needed for passage. Lecornu's strategic promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform until after the 2027 election was key to securing enough support to defeat the measure. While the government remains in power, the close vote highlights the fragility of Macron's centrist alliance in a deeply divided National Assembly.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with a 39.1% increase from the previous year, significantly beating market estimates. The surge is primarily driven by robust global demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strengthening AI megatrend, CEO C.C. Wei announced that the company is raising its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. The positive results demonstrate TSMC's dominant position in the semiconductor industry and its pivotal role in the ongoing AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Natalie Grabow, an 80-year-old grandmother from New Jersey, has become the oldest woman ever to finish the grueling Ironman World Championship in Hawaii. She completed the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and 26.2-mile run in 16 hours, 45 minutes, and 26 seconds. Remarkably, Grabow only learned to swim at age 59 specifically to compete in triathlons, overcoming a significant personal hurdle. Her achievement is being celebrated as an inspiration, demonstrating that it is never too late to take on new challenges and pursue ambitious physical goals.</p>

          <p>During a meeting with the French foreign minister, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi emphasized that China and the European Union should position themselves as partners. Wang expressed hope that France would encourage the EU to maintain "genuine strategic autonomy" and adopt a positive perception of China. The meeting comes amid ongoing tensions between China and the EU, fueled by mistrust over the war in Ukraine, a significant trade deficit, and reciprocal trade frictions that have resulted in tariffs. Wang is also scheduled to meet with foreign ministers from Spain and Sweden to further discuss diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying a process called programmed cell death, where proteins inside cells can trigger self-destruction, for its potential to treat major diseases. In conditions like Alzheimer's, brain cells die too early, while in cancer, harmful cells fail to die when they should. Scientists at the Stowers Institute have been investigating "death fold" proteins, which can cause a cell to implode when they detect a threat, a process they believe is similar to the chemical reaction in reusable hand warmers. By understanding how to control this mechanism, researchers hope to develop treatments that can prolong the life of necessary cells or induce death in cancerous ones.</p>

          <h2>Debate Over Free Public Transit Divides Urban Policy Advocates</h2>

          <p>The concept of making public buses free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but the idea has divided transit advocates and policymakers. Proponents argue that fare-free transit would increase ridership, make transportation more equitable, and speed up service by allowing all-door boarding. However, skeptics contend that the primary deterrents to bus ridership are infrequent and unreliable service, not cost. They argue that funds would be better spent on improving service frequency and infrastructure, like dedicated bus lanes, to attract more riders. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after failing to find a sustainable funding source, highlight the financial challenges of such a policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As employer-based family health insurance premiums are expected to surge next year, a small but notable number of U.S. companies are choosing to cover the full cost for their employees. Firms like Boston Consulting Group and the startup Bartesian offer zero-premium health plans, meaning no deductions are taken from employee paychecks for coverage. These companies view the benefit as a crucial tool for recruiting and retaining talent, boosting productivity, and fostering a healthier workforce. While this approach represents a significant investment, executives believe the payoff in employee loyalty and focus outweighs the rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The slowdown in China's luxury market may be nearing its end, according to analysts and luxury goods giant LVMH. The world's largest luxury group reported its first quarterly sales growth of the year, noting that Chinese consumer behavior is approaching stabilization. LVMH's CFO stated that sales in mainland China grew by mid to high-single digits in the third quarter, though spending by Chinese tourists abroad declined. While a full rebound is still expected to take time due to China's property slump and high youth unemployment, improving stock prices and pent-up demand are contributing to a cautiously upbeat outlook.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling sided with two unions who argued that the administration was unlawfully using the funding lapse to downsize the federal workforce for political reasons. The judge cited public statements by President Trump and his budget chief as evidence of these motivations. The administration had begun issuing layoff notices to approximately 4,000 workers at agencies like the Treasury and Health and Human Services, with plans to cut over 10,000 jobs in total.</p>
