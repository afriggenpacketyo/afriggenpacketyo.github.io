        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the special bond between local players and their hometown fans, using Trent Alexander-Arnold as a primary example. It discusses how players who represent their boyhood clubs often experience a deeper connection with supporters due to shared local roots and experiences. The article also highlights the pressures and expectations that come with being a local player, noting that fans may not always be more patient simply because a player is from the area. It balances the romantic idea of playing for one's local club with the realities of modern football, where players often move on for various reasons, and how Alexander-Arnold will need to sacrifice some things to play for Real Madrid, if he chooses to do so.</p>

          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan's representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening alignment with Beijing. This move underscores the growing economic ties between African nations and China, which has prompted African states to be reluctant to offend Beijing by giving Taiwan any prominence. The article also notes that Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing ties with Somaliland. Taiwan's diminishing presence in Africa highlights Beijing's increasing influence on the continent.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to reduce prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kg amid soaring costs. The initiative seeks to alleviate the burden on consumers as inflation outpaces wage growth. The government will commence procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in supermarkets reached a record high due to a poor harvest and increased demand, but analysts remain uncertain whether this move will significantly impact overall prices.</p>

The aim is to provide appropriate care in a calm environment and reduce long waits in A&E.

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. The FAA air traffic controllers aborted the landings out of caution due to uncertainty about the helicopter's location. The Army stated that there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic, but the incident has heightened concerns about close calls between military and commercial aircraft.</p>

          <p>Pascal Siakam scored a playoff career-high 39 points as the Indiana Pacers defeated the New York Knicks 114-109, taking a 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. The Pacers displayed poise and versatility, with strong performances from Myles Turner and Tyrese Haliburton. The Knicks struggled with turnovers and defensive communication, allowing the Pacers too many open looks. The series now shifts to Indiana, with the Pacers halfway to their second NBA finals appearance.</p>

          <p>This review discusses ‚ÄúSister Midnight,‚Äù a gritty comedy about a young housewife's urban malaise in Mumbai. The film follows Uma as she breaks free from her arranged marriage and finds strength in her alternative existence. The reviewer praises Radhika Apte's performance and the film's unique style, but notes that it struggles to connect its episodic nature with its feminist themes. Despite some shortcomings, the movie is seen as an inventive and unmanageable fever dream.</p>

          <p>Four partners, including Democratic attorney Karen Dunn, are departing Paul Weiss following the firm's controversial agreement with President Trump. The agreement involved the firm making compromises to avoid targeting by the federal government. It is unclear if the attorneys' departures are related to the deal. The agreement was controversial in the legal community after Mr. Trump targeted Paul Weiss with an executive order that sharply limited how the firm could interact with the government, seeking to revoke staff members' security clearances and cut off any federal contracts.</p>

          <p>China has approved a 767-kilometre-long canal linking Jiangxi province to Zhejiang, aiming to enhance inland water transport. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal, part of a larger project connecting Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal in China. The canal would connect Jiangxi, a growing manufacturing hub for electric vehicles, to seaports in Zhejiang, one of China‚Äôs wealthiest provinces. The canal is planned as a Class III waterway able to accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, has stated that the EU is committed to securing a trade deal with the US based on "respect," not "threats," after President Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on all goods sent from the EU to the United States. The EU has warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides. Trump's threats have been met with resistance from European governments, who maintain that negotiations are the best way forward.</p>

          <p>Irish-language hip-hop trio Kneecap performed their biggest festival headline gig just days after a band member, Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, was charged with a terror offence for allegedly displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah. The band denied the offence, calling it "political policing". At the Wide Awake festival, the rapper said the authorities were "trying to silence us before Glastonbury" and urged fans to be "on the right side of history." Fans waved Irish and Palestinian flags, and the band performed tracks about Northern Ireland and Gaza.</p>
