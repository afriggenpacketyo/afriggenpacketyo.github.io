          <p>Following their victory in the Euro 2025 final, England's Under-21 football team is being evaluated for potential senior squad members for the next World Cup. Players like Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott are highlighted as strong candidates to make the step up, continuing a trend of youth players progressing to the senior team. The article discusses the challenge for these young talents to secure regular club football, which is crucial for their development and consideration for the national team.

          <p>Reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley have given their first interview since being released from federal prison after receiving a presidential pardon from Donald Trump. The couple, who served two years for bank fraud and tax evasion, described difficult prison conditions and their focus on advocating for prison reform. Their daughter Savannah's advocacy, including a speech at the RNC, was instrumental in securing the pardon, a decision that has drawn criticism. The Chrisleys remain unapologetic about their lifestyle and plan to return to television with a new show.</p>

          <h2>Centennial of Santa Barbara Earthquake Offers Lessons for Modern Seismic Preparedness</h2>

          <p>The 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake serves as a reminder of California's seismic vulnerabilities and the lessons learned about building safety. The quake exposed the dangers of unreinforced brick structures, yet it took decades and further tragedies for many cities to mandate retrofitting. Experts note that even today, many areas have not required strengthening for other vulnerable building types, such as "soft-story" apartments. The historical event not only spurred early seismic building codes but also famously reshaped downtown Santa Barbara's architecture into its signature Spanish Colonial Revival style.</p>

          <p>Lee Calvert, a 100-year-old woman, is adapting to a new life after the Palisades fire destroyed her mobile home of over six decades. A fiercely independent athlete and community figure, Calvert had intended to live out her days in her Pacific Palisades home with an ocean view. The fire forced her to relocate to her daughter's home in the Santa Cruz mountains, where she is actively rebuilding her social life through dancing, hiking, and pottery. Her story is one of remarkable resilience and adaptation in the face of profound loss at an advanced age.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprisingly restrained reactions from China and Russia to the recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on Iran expose the weaknesses of their so-called anti-American axis. Despite shared antagonism toward the West, both nations refrained from offering significant military or diplomatic support to Tehran, prioritizing their own economic and strategic interests. This cautious approach suggests that when global stability is at risk, Beijing and Moscow are unwilling to fully back Iran, revealing that their "no limits" partnership is more conditional than advertised and bound more by convenience than a shared worldview.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), bringing hope for renewal to the ailing party. Coming from a working-class background in Duisburg, Bas's career is a story of upward mobility through vocational training and political engagement, and she now also serves as Germany's labor minister. As a member of the SPD's left wing, she is expected to provide a counterbalance to her re-elected co-chair, Lars Klingbeil. Her election, with a strong 95% of the vote, signals a desire for change and a focus on social solidarity within the party.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions winger James Lowe has brushed off attempts by a Perth stadium announcer to troll the team over its players born in the southern hemisphere. Before a match against Western Force, the announcer pointedly noted the "Kiwi now Irishman" Lowe and other players of Australian or South African origin. Lowe, who performed well in the Lions' victory, responded humorously, stating the gag can continue if the team keeps winning. The incident follows recent comments by Australia's coach on the same topic, which has become a recurring theme of the tour.</p>

          <p>In an article explaining its journalistic practices, NPR outlines its strict criteria for using anonymous sources in its reporting. The organization's strong preference is for all sources to be on the record, but it will grant anonymity in specific cases where a source faces significant risk, such as job loss or imprisonment, for speaking out. Before approval by senior editors, the source's information must be deemed vital, credible, and unobtainable otherwise. When anonymity is used, NPR commits to explaining the reason to its audience and providing as much detail as possible about the source without revealing their identity.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared reluctant to engage, throwing very few punches for most of the contest. Despite his clear victory, Paul was met with jeers from the crowd, which he dismissed. The win continues Paul's controversial but successful boxing career, though it raises familiar questions about the quality and motivation of his aging opponents.</p>
