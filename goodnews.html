CEO Jane Fraser highlighted strong performance across key business areas, including a record second quarter for Equities. Despite the positive results, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deteriorating economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric air taxi developer Joby Aviation is significantly increasing its production capabilities as it aims for a 2026 service launch. The company announced the start of production at its new components facility in Dayton, Ohio, and is doubling the capacity of its main manufacturing hub in Marina, California. This expansion is expected to create hundreds of jobs and allow the California factory to produce up to 24 aircraft annually. The move reflects growing momentum in the eVTOL sector, following Joby's recent delivery of an aircraft to the UAE for service next year.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans. The administration had planned to revoke the protections, arguing the security situation in Afghanistan has improved. However, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals has paused the termination for one week to allow for legal briefs to be filed. Advocacy groups praised the decision as a critical, albeit temporary, relief for Afghan families who fled Taliban persecution and would otherwise face deportation.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, considered one of the best celestial events of the year, begins this week and will be active until late August. According to NASA, the shower is expected to peak on the nights of August 12-13, potentially producing 50 to 100 meteors per hour. The event is caused by Earth passing through the debris trail of Comet Swift-Tuttle, with the particles burning up in our atmosphere. For optimal viewing in the Northern Hemisphere, it is recommended to find a dark location away from city lights and look up in the pre-dawn hours.</p>

The policy aims to keep Chinese companies integrated into the American tech ecosystem, making them reliant on U.S. hardware.

Both companies have seen significant gains, partly driven by the AI boom, with NRG supplying power to data centers and Palantir providing AI software. The analysis notes NRG's transformation into a more traditional utility through a major acquisition, which could provide stable growth. In contrast, Palantir's explosive growth in commercial contracts is tempered by its extremely high valuation, which presents a risk for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
