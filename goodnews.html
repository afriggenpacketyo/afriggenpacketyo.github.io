          <p>Milwaukee Brewers prospect Jacob Misiorowski, making his MLB debut, was forced to leave the game after five no-hit innings due to cramping in his right calf and quadriceps. Misiorowski, who reached 100 mph on several pitches, also possibly turned an ankle, according to manager Pat Murphy. Despite the injury, Murphy praised Misiorowski's impressive performance and composure. The Brewers went on to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-0, remaining close to the division lead.</p>

          <p>The IPO market is experiencing a revival in June, with successful public debuts from companies like Chime, Voyager Technologies, and Circle. This resurgence has emboldened other companies, such as Gemini and Caris Life Sciences, to pursue listings, leading to increased activity for investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo. However, geopolitical tensions, such as Israel's attack on Iran, and unpredictable trade policies from President Trump could introduce volatility and cause companies to reconsider their IPO plans. Despite potential risks, experts anticipate that 2025 will be a stronger year for IPOs than 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a decline following the announcement of an $850 million share sale. The electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) company plans to utilize the funds to support infrastructure development and an AI-based aviation software platform. This funding will also support Archer's Launch Edition program, including its partnership to provide air taxi services during the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. The stock offering follows President Trump's executive order to support the development and deployment of eVTOL vehicles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley has announced the inclusion of an expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposed reauthorization of RECA will allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders," to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. Hawley called this a "huge step forward" and a "huge victory" in the fight to secure compensation for those affected by nuclear exposure. The Senate is still working through the larger contours of the bill, which is expected to include an extension of the Trump 2017 Tax cuts and more funding for defense and border security.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded significantly in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about the economy and potential inflation surges have eased. The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers reported broad-based improvements in sentiment, with respondents also reducing their near-term inflation outlook. The rebound coincides with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, as well as a 90-day negotiation period with China. However, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing concerns about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly close to finalizing a return to Saracens after a season with French side Racing 92. The 33-year-old is keen to move back to England after a challenging season in France. While a deal is yet to be signed, an agreement between Saracens and Racing is expected to allow Farrell to move this summer. Saracens are looking for cover for the injured Alex Lozowski and are allowed dispensation in the salary cap to replace him for next season. A transition into coaching at Saracens appears inevitable.</p>
