He now works as a superyacht captain, earning significantly more than his previous career, often doubling his $10,000 monthly salary with tips. Ortega emphasizes that while the job offers financial benefits and travel, it requires a strong willingness to learn, a service-oriented personality, and humility, cautioning against entering solely for money. He also mentors aspiring yachties through his "Superyacht Sunday School," helping over 90% of students find jobs.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $815 million, marking it as the seventh largest in the game's history, after no winning tickets were sold for the previous $750 million drawing. This substantial prize has an estimated cash value of $367.9 million for the upcoming Wednesday drawing, with the potential for further increase as ticket sales rise. A single jackpot winner can choose between a lump sum payment or an annuity, consisting of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, making it a rare but highly anticipated event for participants across the 45 states where tickets are sold.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a breakthrough in "invisibility" technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, making their radar emissions exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. The new method uses frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigning each antenna a minutely varied frequency to make signals chaotic and obscure their directional origin. This innovation aims to protect these critical command nodes, which are typically vulnerable high-value targets due to their powerful radar emissions.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again scrubbed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. The mission, crucial for demonstrating fixes and upgrades after previous failures, was initially delayed by an oxygen leak. A successful flight would pave the way for faster launch cadences and autonomous propellant transfers, vital for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and future Mars missions, despite skepticism from some experts about the 2027 moon landing timeline.</p>

While no concrete agreements on trade or defense were made, Lee's approach seemingly averted a confrontation, ensuring he left on Trump's good side and maintaining the economic alliance between the two nations.</p>
