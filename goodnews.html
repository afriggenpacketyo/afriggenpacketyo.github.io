          <p>President Trump's first stop on his four-day Middle East tour was Saudi Arabia, where he received an opulent welcome from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, solidifying the strong diplomatic and business ties between the two nations. The Saudi Royal Court, resembling a "Mar-a-Lago East," impressed Trump with its lavish gold d√©cor, aligning with his taste for luxury. The visit included a tour of Saudi megaprojects and a reenactment of historical Saudi-American partnerships, highlighting the kingdom's efforts to strengthen relations with the U.S. and appeal to Trump's personal interests, including real estate development. </p>

          <p>State Farm has been granted temporary permission to increase homeowners' insurance rates by 17% in California, following catastrophic fires, despite criticism from consumer groups and homeowners. The insurer cited a "dire situation" and requested the increase to address financial strains. Consumer Watchdog argued the increase was unjustified and criticized State Farm for allegedly lowballing claims after the fires. The state's insurance commissioner presented the increase as a compromise amidst a statewide insurance crisis, while State Farm stated it remains concerned about its California subsidiary's financial position. </p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed openness to discussing the deployment of France's nuclear weapons in other European countries, amid growing concerns about European security. Macron emphasized that any shared nuclear deterrence would not compromise France's defense capabilities, with ultimate control remaining with the French president. The proposal comes as many European leaders feel they can no longer rely on the US' nuclear commitment to Europe, particularly in light of the Russian threat. Germany and other nations have shown interest in the proposal, though Germany maintains that it is not a substitute for the U.S. nuclear guarantee. </p>
