        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet has found that different antidepressants produce widely varying physiological side effects, including significant changes in weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and found, for example, that some drugs were associated with an average weight gain of four pounds, while others led to an average loss of five and a half pounds. The study's authors emphasize that these medications remain effective and life-saving treatments for depression and anxiety. They recommend that doctors use this information to better tailor prescriptions to individual patient health profiles and carefully monitor for potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially approved Julia Koch's acquisition of a 10% minority stake in the New York Giants, a deal that values the franchise at a record $10.3 billion. This transaction marks the highest valuation for an NFL team in a sale context. The league also greenlit two other minority stake sales: an 8% share of the New England Patriots at a $9 billion valuation and a 3.2% stake in the San Francisco 49ers at an $8.6 billion valuation. These escalating valuations reflect growing investor confidence, fueled by the introduction of private equity and the anticipation of significantly more lucrative media rights deals in the near future.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new warehouse robot named 'Blue Jay,' a system of suspended robotic arms designed to perform multiple tasks such as picking, sorting, and consolidating items simultaneously. The company states the technology aims to assist employees with strenuous tasks and improve efficiency, noting it can handle approximately 75% of items stored in its facilities. This development comes amid scrutiny of Amazon's automation strategy, following reports that the company projects it can avoid hiring over 160,000 workers by 2027 through such innovations. Amazon maintains that employees remain central to its operations and that automation creates new, more rewarding career opportunities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 NFL draft class is making an unprecedented impact, setting records for total yards and touchdowns by rookies through the first seven weeks of the season. Offensive skill players, in particular, are excelling, with several wide receivers, tight ends, and running backs quickly becoming key players for their teams. Analysts attribute this success to rookies entering the league better prepared and, in some cases, being in ideal situations to showcase their talent immediately. While some top draft picks like quarterback Cam Ward are struggling on rebuilding teams, the overall performance of this class suggests a significant influx of game-changing talent into the league.</p>

          <p>A council in Richmond-upon-Thames has canceled a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring the last of her coffee down a street drain. The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, explained she did so to avoid spilling it on a bus she was about to board, believing it was a responsible action. She was immediately stopped by three enforcement officers and issued a fixed penalty notice, an experience she found intimidating. After the case received media attention, the council reviewed the incident and withdrew the fine, acknowledging the contravention was minor and apologizing for the inconvenience, prompting calls for clearer public guidance on such regulations.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche has stated that winning games is more important than adhering to a specific fashionable style of play. Taking over a team in the relegation zone, Dyche emphasized the need for "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation in the Premier League. His hiring follows the brief and unsuccessful tenure of Ange Postecoglou, whose expansive, attacking approach failed to yield results. Dyche, known for his pragmatic approach at previous clubs, believes the key is to find a style that works for the current squad and restores a winning mentality, regardless of whether it involves long or short passes.</p>
