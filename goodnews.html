          <h2>Wharton Professor Discusses AI's Impact on the Future of Work and Entry-Level Roles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wharton associate professor Ethan Mollick suggests that while artificial intelligence is not yet capable of fully replacing human jobs, it poses a significant concern for the entry-level workforce. He argues that the immediate challenge isn't mass unemployment but rather developing expertise and judgment to oversee AI systems, as traditional apprenticeship models may become obsolete. Mollick advises that jobs with a variety of "bundled" tasks are more resilient to AI disruption than single-focus roles, and emphasizes that organizational leaders must articulate a clear vision for AI integration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Archdiocese of Los Angeles has launched a program to deliver essential supplies like food and medication to immigrant families who are afraid to leave their homes due to ongoing immigration enforcement raids. Archbishop José H. Gómez stated the initiative aims to support community members experiencing significant fear and anxiety. The program, funded by donations, will utilize parish networks across three counties, reactivating delivery systems established during the COVID-19 pandemic. This response comes as ICE has arrested nearly 3,000 people in the Los Angeles area since June.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 11:03:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League's summer transfer window has seen massive spending, dominated by the league's top clubs. Liverpool leads the expenditure with £269 million, including a potential British record for Florian Wirtz, followed by Chelsea and Arsenal, who have also spent over £200 million. This spending spree contrasts with previous years and highlights a growing financial gap, with the top six clubs accounting for a significant majority of the total outlay. Football finance experts note that despite the large sums, Liverpool's spending remains within profit and sustainability rules, bolstered by increased revenue.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic has announced two new hires, including its first-ever staff archivist and historian, Jake Lundberg, from the University of Notre Dame. The magazine's editor-in-chief expressed that this new role is intended to combat "willed amnesia" by unearthing and contextualizing content from The Atlantic's 168-year history. Additionally, Drew Goins, a former Washington Post newsletter writer and "Jeopardy!" champion, joins as a senior editor. Goins will focus on developing new strategies to engage readers, beginning with creating trivia-based experiences for the audience.</p>

          <p>With more Americans claiming Social Security at the earliest possible age of 62, this article outlines three strategies to avoid tapping into benefits early and thus secure a larger monthly payment for life. One method is to invest in an annuity to create a private income stream that can bridge the financial gap until age 70. Another option for homeowners is a reverse mortgage, which allows them to borrow against home equity to supplement income. Finally, the article suggests maximizing catch-up contributions to tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Expresses Belief That Federal Reserve is Prepared to Lower Interest Rates</h2>

          <p>Following a meeting with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, President Donald Trump stated his belief that the central bank will soon begin to lower interest rates. Trump interpreted Powell's comments about the country's economic well-being as a signal that a policy easing is forthcoming, a move the president has long advocated for. White House officials have continued to press for a review of the Federal Reserve's operations, though they characterize it as a policy concern rather than a pressure campaign. Despite past animosity, both sides described the recent meeting in positive terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the nearly five-millennia-long history of fountains, tracing their evolution from practical water sources in ancient Crete to symbols of political power during the Renaissance. Fountains have held sacred meaning in various cultures, from purification rituals to reflecting the Quranic vision of Paradise in Islamic gardens. In modern times, they have become spectacular attractions like those in Las Vegas and Dubai. As climate change brings more intense heatwaves, cities are now adapting these historical features, retrofitting them with misting nozzles to provide public cooling, blending ancient utility with contemporary needs.</p>

This investment has paid off, as she earned over $870,000 in 2024 from her Miami-based private practice and nationwide telehealth contracts.

Analysts argue Germany needs a coherent, long-term strategy to secure access to critical raw materials and participate in the continent's development.

          <p>This article explores the challenges in diagnosing and treating depression in older adults, a condition often stigmatized or misattributed to the normal aging process. Experts note that while symptoms are similar across age groups, older individuals may present with more physical complaints, leading to misdiagnosis by physicians. The treatment is also complicated by potential interactions between antidepressants and other medications. Researchers emphasize the need for greater awareness among both patients and doctors to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment, as unaddressed depression can become more chronic and severe.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast interview, actress Sarah Jessica Parker shared that when she was 18 and starting her career, she would budget her expenses to just $40 for three days. This early experience with financial discipline taught her the value of "security in being able to pay your bills." While her method was restrictive, financial experts today advise freelancers against such extreme rationing. Instead, they recommend a "bucketing strategy," where income is allocated by percentage to essentials, savings, and wants, to better manage the volatility of an unpredictable income stream.</p>
