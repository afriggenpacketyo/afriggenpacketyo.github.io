          <p>Reports indicate that Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. While explosions were reported and missiles were seen over Doha, Qatari authorities claimed successful interception, with no reported casualties. President Trump acknowledged the attack as a "weak response" and expressed gratitude for early notice, which he said prevented casualties. The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of sovereignty and international law, stating they reserve the right to respond, while Iran's supreme leader asserted they did not intend to harm anyone. The tone of the article reflects a tense but contained situation. Optimism is slightly higher due to the lack of casualties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent price increases. While initial market reactions saw price fluctuations, experts speculate that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions and potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities could still disrupt the energy market. Analysts suggest that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could cause prices to spike significantly, impacting economies worldwide, although limited disruptions would likely have a limited impact. The analysis suggests a volatile market influenced by geopolitical factors. (not investment advice)</p>
