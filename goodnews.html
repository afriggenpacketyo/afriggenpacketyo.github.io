          <p>Shares of PepsiCo surged after activist investment firm Elliott Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company. In a letter to the board, Elliott outlined a plan to revitalize the consumer giant's business momentum, describing the current situation as a "historic opportunity" to unlock significant shareholder value. This move comes as PepsiCo has been implementing cost-cutting measures and working to improve profit margins amid shifting consumer demand. Elliott Management is known for its aggressive activist campaigns that have driven changes at other major corporations like Southwest Airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major art exhibition titled "Listen to the Echo" is being held in Germany to celebrate the 70th birthday of acclaimed South African artist William Kentridge. The retrospective, hosted by museums in Essen and Dresden, showcases his extensive body of work, including his famous charcoal drawings, animated films, sculptures, and tapestries. Kentridge's art frequently explores themes of colonialism, social power, and the legacy of apartheid in his home country. The exhibition provides a comprehensive look at his artistic development, from his early works dissecting the apartheid regime to recent multimedia installations that examine the fragile relationship between art and power.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the benefit of locking in high rates for a fixed term. While national average CD yields for one-year terms are around 2.04% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for shorter terms. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. Financial experts suggest strategies like exploring online banks and laddering CDs of various term lengths to maximize earnings in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to utilize the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket, which could be accessible to more people due to new deductions in 2025. This bracket allows individuals with taxable income below certain thresholds—$48,350 for single filers and $96,700 for married couples—to sell appreciated assets without paying taxes on the profits. The strategy, known as "tax-gain harvesting," can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. Advisors suggest that this is an opportune time to consider such strategies within a broader financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Amgen has announced plans to invest over $600 million to construct a new research and development facility at its headquarters in Thousand Oaks, California. The project, set to begin this year, is expected to create hundreds of jobs and will focus on developing next-generation drugs for serious diseases. This investment is part of a larger trend of drugmakers increasing their U.S. presence, partly in response to potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals threatened by the Trump administration. Since 2017, Amgen has invested nearly $5 billion in U.S. capital expenditures, including major expansions in Ohio and North Carolina.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked women's tennis player Aryna Sabalenka has stated that drinking high-quality tequila makes her "feel great" the next day, contributing to the spirit's growing reputation as a "cleaner" alcoholic beverage. While industry insiders note that additive-free tequila made from 100% agave may be better tolerated by some, health experts caution against viewing any alcohol as a health drink. Experts emphasize that ethanol is the primary cause of hangovers, regardless of the beverage's purity, and that alcohol consumption negatively impacts athletic performance, sleep, and muscle recovery. They conclude that while some spirits may have fewer additives, no amount of alcohol is truly beneficial for health.</p>

Top high-yield accounts, particularly those from online banks, are currently offering rates between 4.15% and 4.35% APY. Online banks can offer higher rates due to lower overhead costs and often come with benefits like no monthly fees and low minimum deposit requirements.

The lead plaintiff was found to have been underpaid by about $600 on her vehicle. State Farm, which no longer uses the same valuation program, is facing similar legal challenges in other states, highlighting a broader issue of how insurers calculate replacement costs for total-loss vehicles.</p>

          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a significant resurgence in the luxury vehicle market, driven by strong sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). The General Motors brand has seen 12 consecutive quarters of sales growth, with EVs now accounting for about a third of its recent sales, far outpacing the industry average. Notably, nearly 80% of Cadillac's new customers are trading in vehicles from competing German luxury brands like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. This shift suggests that Cadillac's focus on electrification is successfully helping it recapture prestige and market share that it had lost to foreign rivals over the past several decades.</p>

The market is also experiencing a "flight to quality," with high demand for new and modern office buildings, causing their availability rate to tighten significantly. Additionally, the conversion of nearly 9 million square feet of older office space to other uses has helped reduce overall supply and stabilize the market. (not investment advice)</p>
