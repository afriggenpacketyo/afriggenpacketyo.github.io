In an exclusive interview, Netanyahu emphasized his responsibility to protect the Jewish state, referencing the long history of persecution and citing his actions against Iran as necessary for survival. Trump's full remark was complimentary, finishing with praise for Netanyahu's effectiveness, calling it what "makes him great" and acknowledging his "great job."</p>

          <p>OpenAI is making aggressive moves to control its entire technology stack, from chip design to consumer hardware, signaling a major strategic pivot. The company recently announced a partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, similar to deals with Nvidia and AMD, to optimize its infrastructure. This vertical integration strategy, led by CEO Sam Altman, aims to create a complete AI ecosystem akin to Apple's control over its hardware and software. By also acquiring Jony Ive's design firm and launching an app store, OpenAI is positioning itself not just as a model provider but as a dominant, all-encompassing AI platform.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, has announced a plan to invest $13 billion in its U.S. manufacturing operations over the next four years, aiming to add over 5,000 jobs. This strategic move is part of a domestic turnaround effort intended to increase U.S. production by 50% and introduce new vehicles at plants in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. The investment comes as the company seeks to reverse a significant sales decline since 2018 and aligns with the Trump administration's focus on boosting domestic manufacturing. The new vehicles will include a midsize truck, new Jeep models, and a next-generation Dodge Durango.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers All-Star Tyrese Haliburton, who grew up a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now publicly rooting against the team during their MLB playoff run. Haliburton has been seen wearing jerseys of the Brewers' opponents, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers, during his own preseason games. He explained that his change of heart came after the Brewers allegedly canceled his scheduled ceremonial first pitch last summer, shortly after his Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks from the NBA playoffs. Haliburton has since declared himself a "free agent" as a baseball fan.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the evolving identity of women in China, symbolized by the social media trend of urban professional women, or "Tracys," returning to their rural hometowns and temporarily reverting to their simpler "Cuihua" personas. This cultural phenomenon highlights a deeper transformation that has occurred since the 1950 Marriage Law, which first established gender equality as a legal principle. Despite decades of struggle and persistent societal challenges, the article argues that Chinese women are increasingly rewriting their own narratives and futures, navigating the complexities between traditional roles and modern ambitions.</p>
