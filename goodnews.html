        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party has revealed its plans to modify UK immigration policies, focusing on a controlled and selective system. The proposed changes include tightening work visa requirements, generally requiring degree-level qualifications for skilled worker visas, while expanding eligibility for graduates from elite universities outside the UK. Immigrants will typically need to reside in the UK for ten years before applying for indefinite leave to remain, with a potential reduction through an "earned settlement" system based on contributions to the UK economy and society. A dedicated visa for social care workers will be discontinued, and stricter rules for overseas students will be implemented, including reduced post-study stay periods and a potential tax on tuition fee income from international students.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the costs associated with credit counseling, noting that most nonprofit agencies offer free initial consultations. If a debt management plan is recommended, there may be setup fees and monthly maintenance fees, typically ranging from $25 to $50 per month. The total amount paid is capped nationwide at $79 per month. The article compares the cost of credit counseling to other debt relief options like debt forgiveness, debt consolidation, and bankruptcy, highlighting that credit counseling is often the most cost-effective and doesn't typically damage credit scores.</p>

          <p>President Trump called on drugmakers to lower their prices within the next month to be closer to those charged in other high-income countries, threatening to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they fail to do so. He said his move marks an expansion of the "most favored nation" idea from his first term, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services set steep price caps tied to the prices charged in other developed countries for some prescription drugs. The White House says it will seek to develop new rules to revive the price caps in Medicare, in addition to a new "mechanism" to allow Americans to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at this price.</p>

A White House official stated that no aircraft "gift" will be presented or accepted during Trump's visit to Qatar this week, while Qatar said the "transfer of an aircraft for temporary use" to the U.S. Department of Defense was under consideration.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, which launched in 1972 and failed to reach Venus due to an engine malfunction, has crashed back to Earth after over 50 years in orbit. The Russian space agency Roscosmos and NASA reported that the spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere and landed in the Indian Ocean. Due to its design to withstand Venus's harsh atmosphere, some astronomers predicted it would remain intact, but any surviving remnants may be difficult to find. Scientists hope to study the remnants to learn about spacecraft design for future missions.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but it cites no obvious legal authority to mandate lower prices. The order said the administration would consider taking regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries in the future if drugmakers do not comply. The pharmaceutical industry saw this as a win, as they had been bracing for a policy that would be much more damaging to its interests. The order also called on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries, marking a de-escalation of their trade war. The deal involves cancelling some tariffs and suspending others for 90 days, with US tariffs on Chinese imports falling to 30% and Chinese tariffs on some US imports falling to 10%. China has also halted and scrapped other non-tariff countermeasures, such as the export of critical minerals to the US. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the consensus from both countries was that "neither side wants a decoupling".</p>
