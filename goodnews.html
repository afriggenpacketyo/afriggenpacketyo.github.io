        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese smartphone manufacturer Vivo has introduced the Vivo Vision, a mixed-reality headset designed to compete with Apple's Vision Pro. This new device mirrors Apple's design and interface but boasts a significantly lighter weight at 398 grams, approximately 35% less than its rival, addressing a common concern for high-end VR headsets. It features dual 8K resolution OLED displays and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2 Platform, enhancing visual crispness. Currently, the headset operates only with specific Vivo phones and Windows computers, positioning itself as a potentially more accessible alternative in the high-end VR market.</p>

          <p>A disability charity is urging all UK airports to eliminate drop-off fees for blue badge holders, highlighting inconsistencies and complexities in current policies. Many airports offer discounts or waivers, but the system is often difficult to navigate, particularly for those less digitally literate, with some requiring online registration that can take days. Disabled Motoring UK argues that people with disabilities should not be financially penalized for needing close access to terminals. The article details varying airport policies and the challenges faced by disabled passengers, calling for a more respectful and consistent approach across the industry.</p>

          <p>Shane Gorman, whose father died in the 1988 Piper Alpha oil platform disaster, has dedicated his career to offshore safety, following in his father's footsteps. The tragedy, which killed 167 men, remains the world's worst offshore oil and gas accident and profoundly shaped Shane's life. He sought to understand the catastrophic failures, including systemic safety lapses, communication breakdowns, and a "flippancy towards safety" that led to the inferno. This article shares his personal journey for closure and his ongoing commitment to ensuring such a disaster never happens again, emphasizing that people are more important than profit.</p>

          <p>Parents are advocating for peas to be added to the list of 14 allergens legally required on food labels, after their nine-year-old son, Rex, experienced anaphylactic shock from pea protein in a hot cross bun. Pea protein is increasingly found in unexpected products, posing significant risks to individuals with severe allergies. The article highlights how current regulations fail to protect those with pea, pine nut, or other less common allergies, leading to dangerous "games of roulette" and feelings of being dismissed. Experts support expanding the allergen list for public safety.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its tenth anniversary, continues to be a popular avenue for public engagement, despite a mix of serious and humorous campaigns. While many petitions, including those for "Trash Pandas" and "Jeremy Clarkson for PM," are lighthearted, the system has facilitated significant legislative change, such as "Finn's Law" for police service animals, within three years. This article explores the system's evolution, its role in parliamentary debate, and the ongoing debate over its effectiveness in influencing government action, with some critics calling for its shutdown.</p>

          <h2>UK and Indian Researchers Reconstruct Faces of 2,500-Year-Old Skulls from Ancient Indian Civilization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 18:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in India and the UK have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old skulls excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site near Keeladi in southern India. This project aims to understand the ancestry and migration routes of the region's early inhabitants, supporting claims of an independent urban civilization dating back to 580BC, which challenges traditional narratives of Indian urbanisation. The reconstructed faces show features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries. The article highlights how these reconstructions challenge historical narratives and promote a more diverse understanding of Indian heritage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning significant sentencing reforms that could see convicted criminals barred from pubs, concerts, and sports matches through non-custodial terms. These changes would grant courts powers to impose driving and travel bans, or order offenders to remain in specific areas, aiming to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending. The proposals also include mandatory drug testing for offenders on probation. The article highlights these reforms as part of a broader strategy to cut crime and manage prison overcrowding, following earlier early release programs and a recent review of sentencing policy.</p>
