          <p>The Trump administration has announced an initiative to broker a direct meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with subsequent trilateral talks to follow. This diplomatic effort seeks to create momentum for a peace agreement, focusing on security guarantees for Ukraine and the return of Ukrainian prisoners. However, significant obstacles remain, as Ukraine insists on a ceasefire prior to substantive negotiations, a condition the U.S. deems non-essential. Russia also maintains firm positions against European military presence and certain arms sales to Ukraine, complicating the path to a resolution.</p>

          <p>In celebration of World Photography Day, NPR has curated a collection of images from its member station photographers that highlight scenes of community and connection across the United States. The photo essay, titled "Here, together," explores diverse gatherings, from the joy of a first day of school celebration in Hartford to the solemnity of a memorial for flood victims in Texas. These photographs document both ordinary and extraordinary moments, such as a quinceañera photo shoot in Washington, D.C., and a Cowboys of Color rodeo in Dallas, collectively illustrating the complex and varied ways people coexist and connect in their daily lives.</p>

          <p>Over three decades since its inception, the English Premier League (EPL) has transformed into the world's most dominant and lucrative club soccer league, a stark contrast to its origins in an era of hooliganism and financial decline. Its immense wealth, with combined revenues exceeding $8.5 billion, allows it to attract top international talent, creating a highly competitive environment where any team can challenge the top contenders. Unlike other European leagues dominated by one or two superclubs, the EPL's relative balance and high-stakes matches are broadcast to a global audience of billions, fueling its continued growth and solidifying its top-tier status in international sports.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, bringing an end to a strike that disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The airline announced it will gradually resume operations, though it may take a week or more to fully stabilize the schedule. A key issue resolved in the agreement is the guarantee of pay for work performed while aircraft are on the ground, a major point of contention for the union. The deal was reached after the union defied orders from the Canada Industrial Relations Board to return to work, escalating pressure on both sides to negotiate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in Europe's top soccer clubs, attracted by soaring revenues that have grown over 750% since the 1990s. This influx of American capital, including from private equity, now extends to a majority of teams in England's Premier League, such as Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United. The trend is driven by high wealth aggregation in the U.S. and the relative affordability of European clubs compared to major American sports franchises. This investment is reshaping club ownership models and financial strategies, with a growing focus on commercial revenue and potentially holding regular season games overseas.

          <p>The animated film 'Nobody,' from Shanghai Animation Film Studio, has become the highest-grossing 2D animated movie in Chinese box office history, surpassing previous records held by Japanese films like 'Suzume.' Based on a popular online animated series, the film has earned over 1 billion yuan and has been a surprise success during the summer season.

          <h2>Belgian Cities Turn to Wetland Restoration to Combat Flooding and Drought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 06:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the growing threats of extreme weather, cities in the Flanders region of Belgium are restoring natural wetlands to manage both flooding and drought. Due to extensive urbanization and aging sewer systems, the area has become increasingly vulnerable to intense rainfall. Projects like the Sigma Plan involve giving rivers more space by removing dikes and creating controlled flood zones, which also serve as nature reserves. These nature-based solutions can store vast amounts of water during heavy rains and release it slowly during dry periods, offering a sustainable approach to climate adaptation that also enhances local biodiversity and recreation.</p>

          <p>Dan Gilroy, the Emmy-nominated writer for the 'Star Wars' series 'Andor,' provides insight into crafting Mon Mothma's powerful address to the Galactic Senate. He explains that the speech was written for two audiences: the complicit politicians she is condemning and the wider galactic population she hopes to inspire to resist authoritarianism. Drawing inspiration from historical orators like Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill, the speech aims to awaken people from the lethargy induced by dictatorship. Gilroy notes that actor Genevieve O'Reilly's performance captures the character's journey of overcoming fear to deliver a message of defiance against Emperor Palpatine's tyranny.</p>

          <p>A couple in Los Angeles utilized a $5,100 rebate from the city's turf replacement program to convert their conventional lawn into a thriving, low-water landscape filled with native plants. Using online tutorials and resources from organizations like the Theodore Payne Foundation, they taught themselves landscape design, irrigation installation, and plant selection. Their new garden now serves as a habitat for local wildlife and an extension of their living space, featuring lounge areas and pathways made from recycled concrete. The project demonstrates how homeowners can create sustainable, beautiful, and functional outdoor spaces while conserving water and supporting local ecosystems.</p>
