          <p>Walmart reported solid sales growth, particularly in e-commerce, but cautioned that tariffs may lead to price increases for consumers. Despite beating earnings estimates, Walmart's CFO indicated that tariffs are "still too high" and that the company will likely begin raising prices later this month. While Walmart is working with vendors to keep prices down, the magnitude and speed of the tariff increases are unprecedented. The retailer is also trying to maintain its price advantage over competitors and absorb some of the higher costs, but the impact on consumers is inevitable.</p>

          <p>The UK government is in discussions with several countries to establish overseas "return hubs" for asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected, according to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. These hubs would serve as locations to process and manage the return of individuals with no further routes of appeal in the UK. While Starmer did not specify which countries are involved, Albania has stated it is not part of the talks. This initiative differs from previous plans, such as the Rwanda scheme, and aims to address the increasing number of people crossing the English Channel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the phenomenon of "dry texting" among teenagers and its impact on communication and conflict resolution. Dry texting, characterized by short, unenthusiastic responses, is a common way for teens to express disapproval or signal a change in the conversation's vibe. While phones and social media can amplify disputes, they can also transform conflicts into something quieter and more confusing, leading to anxiety and uncertainty. Experts suggest that ambiguous signals in online communication can hinder the development of conflict resolution skills, but also acknowledge that phones can sometimes help teens resolve conflicts by providing time to think before responding.</p>

          <p>Walmart's first quarter profit slipped, prompting the retailer to announce it will raise prices due to higher costs from tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump. Despite solid sales growth, Walmart did not issue a profit outlook for the second quarter, citing the chaotic environment of constantly changing tariff policies. CEO Doug McMillon stated that Walmart will do its best to keep prices low but cannot absorb all the pressure from tariffs due to narrow retail margins. The company is among the first major U.S. retailers to report financial results, providing insight into the mood of American shoppers and the impact of tariffs on business.</p>

Trump has long demanded higher defense expenses from NATO members, and Germany's new government is prioritizing defense and military matters, pushing for changes to the country's debt rules to enable higher spending.

The piece criticizes both the political left and right for failing to support the nuanced work of real cops, with conservatives favoring aggressive tactics and the left often disparaging enforcement altogether. The author emphasizes the importance of legal sensibility and community trust in fighting crime effectively.</p>

However, analysts warn that the strong rate of growth is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased employer taxes. The Labour government has made boosting the economy its top priority, but faces criticism for its decision to increase employer taxes.</p>
