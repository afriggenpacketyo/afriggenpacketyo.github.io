          <p>Newly circulated air-to-air photographs of China's J-35 stealth fighter jet provide strong evidence that the aircraft has entered initial production and is nearing operational readiness. The images clearly show the jets with official naval markings, including the "Flying Shark" insignia, and serial numbers, indicating they are part of a low-rate production run. Military observers suggest these details confirm the fifth-generation fighter's integration into the People's Liberation Army Navy's carrier aviation force. The jets are expected to be deployed on China's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, significantly enhancing its naval combat capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Donald Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining by exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers within other countries and trading blocs. Nations like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations and standards that hinder their own economic potential. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly prompting movement toward creating more unified domestic markets and removing these internal obstacles. For example, the EU is considering proposals to break down regulatory differences between member states, which could unlock significant economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's largest music company representing artists like Taylor Swift, Drake, and Billie Eilish, has filed for a public stock listing in the United States. The company, which is already listed on the Netherlands stock exchange with a valuation of nearly €50 billion, submitted a confidential statement to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The move is supported by major shareholders like billionaire Bill Ackman, who believes a U.S. listing will enhance the company's value and trading liquidity. UMG owns iconic record labels such as Motown and Capitol Music Group.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have confirmed that most of the more than 160 people reported missing after the deadly July Fourth floods have been found safe. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, with most fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. The county judge explained that the initial high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists who left the area after the floods without checking in. After an exhaustive effort to verify each report, officials now state that only three individuals remain unaccounted for, a common pattern of revision following large-scale natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Billy Joel has provided an update on his health, stating he feels "good" two months after being diagnosed with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old musician mentioned he is still working on his balance but that the condition feels less severe than its description as a "brain disorder" might suggest. The diagnosis forced Joel to cancel numerous tour dates across North America and Europe for 2025 and 2026. NPH involves a build-up of fluid in the brain and can affect mobility, with Joel currently undergoing specific physical therapy as part of his recovery.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—that he believes are poised for continued momentum, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies, which he dubbed "PARC," represent a separate track in the market where enthusiasm from individual buyers is a primary driver of value. While acknowledging their recent pullback, Cramer suggested these names are likely to rebound due to their solid earnings and analyst attention. He advised investors to be disciplined and take profits when they see significant gains in these more speculative names. (not investment advice)</p>

The new system will allow travelers to choose specific seats, including options with extra legroom, and will introduce a new boarding process with eight numbered groups based on seat location and loyalty status, intended to improve efficiency and the customer experience.</p>
