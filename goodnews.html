          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk posted stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but cut its outlook for global container market volume growth due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. While maintaining its 2025 profit guidance, Maersk revised global container market volume growth to -1% to 4%. The company expects disruption in the Red Sea to continue throughout the year. These results come as the shipping industry navigates a complex tariff landscape sparked by trade tensions between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026. This forecast marks the first sales projection since the announcement of the successor to the original Switch. The Switch 2, priced at $449.99 in the U.S., boasts improved features. However, pre-orders in the U.S. were delayed due to President Trump's tariffs on countries where Nintendo consoles are manufactured, specifically Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's has postponed its auction of sacred jewels linked to the Buddha's remains in Hong Kong after the Indian government threatened legal action. The collection, known as the Piprahwa Gems, was described as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era. India argued that the relics constitute "inalienable religious and cultural heritage" and their sale violates international laws. The auction house said the suspension would allow for discussions between the parties involved.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Nigel Farage's opposition to net zero policies aligns with the views of many voters, who prioritize cutting the cost of living over tackling climate change. A recent poll revealed that almost 60% of voters consider cutting the cost of living more important than achieving net zero, while only 13% prioritize net zero. The author suggests that this indicates a lack of genuine belief in the urgency of net zero policies, as voters are unwilling to prioritize them over personal finances.</p>
