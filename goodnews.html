          <p>A photo taken during a cabinet meeting reveals that former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was using the Signal app to communicate with other Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This occurred after President Trump had discouraged the use of the encrypted messaging app due to security concerns and a recent leak controversy. A White House spokeswoman stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, however, Waltz previously used Signal to discuss pending military strikes which triggered a controversy earlier in the year. This incident raises questions about adherence to security protocols within the administration. </p>

The author contends that the Trump administration lacks a coherent strategy for prevailing in the trade conflict with China. The article suggests that while Trump's approach may be extreme, fuzzy thinking regarding China is not unique to him. The author emphasizes the importance of aligning purpose, goal, and means in any conflict.</p>
