          <h2>Health Experts Advise Against Sleeping with Wet Hair Due to Fungal and Bacterial Risks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists and hairstylists are warning against the common practice of going to bed with wet hair, citing several health and cosmetic reasons. When wet, hair is more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase. More importantly, a damp scalp creates a warm, humid environment that is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria. This can lead to scalp conditions like dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, or folliculitis, and the moisture transferred to the pillowcase can also contribute to facial acne or other skin irritations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring giant FICO has announced that it will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services into some of its credit scores this fall. This change reflects the growing popularity of installment payment plans offered by companies like Affirm and Klarna. For consumers, this means that on-time payments could help build their credit history, while missed payments could negatively impact their scores. Lenders have sought this data to gain a more complete financial picture of borrowers, potentially preventing them from offering more credit than a person can afford to repay.</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into the core of global finance. Major financial institutions are increasingly building on Ethereum, valuing its stability and dependability for applications like tokenized assets and funds. Robinhood recently announced it would offer tokenized U.S. stocks via an Ethereum-based network, while giants like Deutsche Bank are developing their own tokenization platforms. This shift from speculative hype to practical utility underscores Ethereum's evolving role as the trusted back-end plumbing for the future of finance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's state-owned company Sinopec has launched a significant offshore floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, a breakthrough for the industry. The project spans approximately 60,000 square meters and features solar panels that rise and fall with the tide. This installation, combined with a similar project launched in May, is expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The proximity to the ocean water also naturally cools the panels, boosting their energy generation efficiency by up to 8 percent.</p>

          <p>Following recent US and Israeli attacks on Iran, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for the negotiation of a "new international agreement" to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a "nuclear disaster." He urged that Iran's nuclear activities be placed under the strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) as part of a new framework. The proposal positions China as a potential mediator while intensifying its criticism of the US and Israeli military actions in the region.</p>

          <p>England, the defending champions, and Wales, making their major tournament debut, have been placed in what is being called the "toughest group" for the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. They are joined by European powerhouses France and the Netherlands, meaning three of the four teams in Group D are ranked in the world's top 11. Statistical models give this group the highest probability of producing the eventual tournament winner. While England aims to continue their major tournament dominance, Wales embraces their underdog status, hoping to cause an upset in a highly competitive opening stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joey Chestnut's triumphant return to the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest is explored as a uniquely American spectacle that reflects both passion and dysfunction. After being banned last year over a sponsorship dispute, Chestnut reclaimed his title, cementing his legacy as an elite athlete in a sport that pushes human consumption to its extreme. This article views the contest as an honest, if grotesque, distillation of American culture, where abundance and a "freedom to consume" have morphed into a "klaxon of decay and excess." Chestnut's performance is framed as a form of punkish satire, holding a mirror to a society defined by hyper-consumption.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially reopened parts of the Seine River for public swimming. The ban, enacted in 1923 due to pollution, was lifted following a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort initiated for the Paris 2024 Olympics. Three designated swimming zones, complete with lifeguards and facilities, are now open to the public, fulfilling a long-standing promise by city officials. The project, which included building a large wastewater storage tank, is seen as a key legacy of the Olympic Games and part of the city's broader effort to improve quality of life.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain enters its Club World Cup quarter-final against Bayern Munich as European champions, embodying a significant cultural shift under manager Luis Enrique. The club has moved away from a focus on individual superstars to a more intense, team-oriented philosophy, which proved successful in their Champions League run. This new identity, praised by Bayern's manager Vincent Kompany, emphasizes collective effort and high-intensity pressing in all phases of the game. The match is seen as a major test for this new "warrior" mentality and a potential preview of a new era of dominance for the French club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by identifying a "genetic switch" that allowed for the complete restoration of damaged ear tissue in mice. The study, published in the journal Science, found that the inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this disabled genetic pathway, the scientists were able to regrow lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the discovery offers hope that similar mechanisms might be present for regenerating other organs.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Brazilian winger Estevão Willian gave Chelsea fans an exciting preview of his talent by scoring a brilliant goal for his current club, Palmeiras, against the Blues in a Club World Cup quarter-final. Although a late own goal secured a 2-1 victory for Chelsea, Estevão's performance was the main talking point. The highly-touted teenager, who will join Chelsea next season in a deal worth up to £52m, showcased the direct running and skill that made him a top transfer target. Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised him as a "huge talent" who will be an important player for the club's future.</p>

While the patient's experience was positive, his surgeon cautions that AI can be unreliable and should not replace professional medical advice. The case highlights the growing role of AI in healthcare, both as a tool for patients and as a technology being adopted by providers for diagnostics and administrative tasks.</p>
