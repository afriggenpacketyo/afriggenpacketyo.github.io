          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, dubbed 'a flying palace,' from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, with ownership then transferring to the Trump presidential library foundation. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice reportedly conclude the gift is legally permissible, not violating bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause, as it benefits the U.S. Air Force and the presidential library, not an individual. The Air Force would modify the 13-year-old aircraft to meet military specifications before transferring it to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation by January 1, 2029; the estimated value of the aircraft is $400 million, excluding security upgrades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation before the House of Councillors election this summer, citing concerns about the significant impact on state coffers. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have generally dismissed the idea of reducing the consumption tax, which currently stands at 8 percent for food and beverages and 10 percent for other items. The coalition government is considering alternative economic measures to address inflation without substantially diminishing tax revenue.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities on Fort Lauderdale‚Äôs historic beachfront has ignited controversy, with some residents suggesting a racial motive behind the decision. The existing basketball courts, popular among a diverse group of players, were built shortly after segregation ended on the city‚Äôs beaches. Campaigners fear the conversion will disrupt a long-standing community tradition and exclude minority residents who frequently use the courts. While developers argue pickleball's broader appeal justifies the change, critics suggest the move reflects an effort to 'whiten' the beach, prompting a debate over community access and inclusivity.</p>

          <p>After decades of upward climb, US life expectancy has recently declined, but scientific advancements offer potential solutions for reversal, according to Dr. Eric Topol. Evidence-based strategies such as understanding and lowering biological age, adopting a Mediterranean diet, prioritizing deep sleep, engaging in strength training, and fostering social connections can contribute to longer, healthier lives. These methods do not require advanced technology, but rather lifestyle adjustments to mitigate risks associated with aging. The article emphasizes the importance of personalized risk assessment and proactive interventions to promote well-being and longevity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a brief commentary on Ron Chernow's biography of Mark Twain, suggesting that it portrays Twain as foolish and easily deceived in his later years, particularly regarding his embrace of the theory that Francis Bacon was the true author of Shakespeare's plays. The piece contrasts this with literary critic Northrop Frye's observation that little is definitively known about Shakespeare beyond basic biographical details and a possibly unflattering portrait, implying that drawing firm conclusions about historical figures can be precarious. The article is a quick take on the challenges of biographical interpretation and the potential for historical figures to be misunderstood or misrepresented.</p>
