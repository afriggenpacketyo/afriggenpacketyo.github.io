          <p>With rising summer temperatures, it's crucial to understand the differences between heat exhaustion and heat stroke, along with appropriate responses. Heat exhaustion, marked by symptoms like headache, fatigue, and nausea, requires immediate removal from the sun, hydration, and cooling measures. Heat stroke, a more severe condition, can lead to impaired consciousness and requires immediate medical attention. Prevention involves avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and taking precautions during physical activities in hot weather. Awareness of these conditions and preventive measures can help ensure a safe summer.</p>

          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong showing in the first round, while former Gov. Andrew Cuomo conceded. Mamdani led with 44% of the vote, followed by Cuomo with 36%. Cuomo's campaign indicated he was considering an independent run in the general election. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, as no candidate reached the 50% threshold. This election is happening nearly four years after Cuomo resigned the governorship after several women accused him of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct.</p>

          <p>Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has urged the European Union to increase its role in global affairs due to increasing tensions with the U.S. and President Donald Trump. His remarks follow Trump's criticism of Europe's inability to resolve the Middle East conflict. Renzi noted that the U.S., Europe's best ally, is attacking the continent daily and there is no agreement about tariffs. He emphasized the need for Europe to step up and play a more prominent role on the world stage.</p>

          <p>A study led by Chinese researchers proposes creating a global solar-wind energy network to meet the world‚Äôs energy demands in 2050. The system would interconnect regions with abundant renewable energy potential to provide power across continents. Researchers suggest that the network could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonisation and be resilient against conflict and climate extremes. The system would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems.</p>
