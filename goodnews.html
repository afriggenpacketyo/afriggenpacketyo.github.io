          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations in Babies Drop Significantly Due to New Preventative Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, attributed to widespread availability of vaccines for pregnant women and monoclonal antibody treatments for infants. Hospitalization rates dropped by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach noted fewer critically ill children with RSV this year and wishes the shot had been available when her own son was hospitalized with the virus. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young babies from severe illness, leading to a significant public health breakthrough. </p>

          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is advocating for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports to reduce border queues. Speaking ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, the minister expressed confidence in reaching an agreement on food standards to lower prices and hopes for a youth mobility scheme. Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns that the proposed deal could lead to the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards. The summit aims to address trade, security, and ease travel restrictions between the UK and EU. </p>

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, the earliest known in China, have returned to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art, part of the Smithsonian Institution in the United States. The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, were illegally excavated in 1942 and later acquired by an American collector. Their repatriation follows diplomatic efforts by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China and the Smithsonian's new ethical returns policy. Volume I, a larger and more complete work, remains privately owned, and efforts are underway to secure its return. </p>
