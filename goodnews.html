          <p>Japan, a skateboarding powerhouse, has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games.

Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the new restriction against the backdrop of increasingly severe injuries among growing children. World Skate Japan has decided not to set an age limit for domestic tournaments amid the latest news.</p>

          <p>An amendment to the Penal Code in Japan, emphasizing rehabilitation in prisons, took effect on Sunday, marking the first changes to punishment forms in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into with and without labor, and prison work is not mandatory, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education. The revised law stipulates imprisonment consists of "confinement in a penal institution," and inmates can be assigned "necessary work" or undergo "necessary guidance" for rehabilitation. The new system sets up 24 programs tailored to an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for elderly inmates and drug abusers.</p>
