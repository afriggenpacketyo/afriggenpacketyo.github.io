          <p>In a Massachusetts retrial, Karen Read was found not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, but was found guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, receiving a one-year probation sentence. The jury acquitted her of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, leading to cheers from her supporters outside the courthouse. Prosecutors alleged Read hit O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argued O'Keefe was attacked by others and left in the snow. Following the verdict, witnesses who testified against Read expressed disappointment, calling the result "a devastating miscarriage of justice," as Read thanked her supporters for their financial and emotional support.</p>

          <p>The case of Karen Read, accused of murdering her boyfriend John O'Keefe, has become a focal point of public scrutiny and mistrust in the criminal justice system, as her second trial ended with a not guilty verdict. The prosecution argued that Read deliberately struck O'Keefe with her SUV while intoxicated, leaving him to die in the cold, but the defense claimed she was framed in a conspiracy involving the Boston Police Department. The defense alleges the crime scene was staged after O'Keefe was injured at a party, and that the investigation was mishandled due to personal links between investigators and witnesses. The case has sparked intense public interest and debate, highlighting concerns about police corruption and the reliability of evidence, with supporters rallying behind Read and questioning the integrity of the investigation.</p>

          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that the risk of widespread contamination is low if the U.S. were to drop a "bunker buster" bomb on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant. The plant primarily processes uranium isotopes, which are heavy gas molecules unlikely to travel far, limiting contamination to the immediate area. While there are concerns about uranium hexafluoride reacting with water to form hydrofluoric acid, the underground nature of the site would inhibit any significant environmental release. The International Atomic Energy Agency has monitored strikes on Iranian facilities, noting that while there was radiological and chemical contamination inside the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant, the radioactivity outside remained at normal levels.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants who received the drug, leading Gilead's CEO to call the approval a "milestone moment" in the fight against HIV. While the approval addresses an existing need, concerns remain over the Trump administration's decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research, which some experts warn could set back progress in the field. Despite the effectiveness of lenacapavir, researchers emphasize the continued need for a vaccine to fully combat the HIV epidemic.</p>

The central bank anticipates inflation to worsen in the coming months but still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its March forecast. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow economic growth this year. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%, emphasizing the need to understand the impact of tariffs before making any rate adjustments.

          <p>The WNBA will issue fines following skirmishes and hard fouls during a recent game between the Indiana Fever and Connecticut Sun. Marina Mabrey's technical foul for shoving Caitlin Clark has been upgraded to a Flagrant-2, resulting in an automatic fine, and Sophie Cunningham will also be fined for her role in an on-court melee. The league has determined that no further penalties will be issued for on-court actions during the game, but the incident has sparked debate about the physicality of the WNBA and officiating standards. Despite the controversy, the Fever's win secured their spot in the Commissioner's Cup final.</p>

          <p>President Trump has endorsed David Ellison's takeover of Paramount Global, despite his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, a subsidiary of Paramount, over a "60 Minutes" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump expressed his hope that the deal would go through, praising Ellison and suggesting that the merger review delay was connected to his lawsuit against CBS. The Paramount-Skydance deal has been pending at the Federal Communications Commission since late last fall, and its completion hinges on the resolution of Trump's legal action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Zillow, specific interior paint colors can increase a home's sale price. A survey of thousands of homebuyers revealed that olive green kitchens and classic navy walls in bedrooms are most desirable, potentially boosting sale prices by thousands of dollars. The hottest kitchen color is olive green, as various shades of muted green in a home's kitchen can generate more buyer interest. Dark gray living rooms also tend to be preferred by buyers, as a dark neutral color can boost a buyer's offer. (not investment advice)</p>
