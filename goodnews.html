          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a dramatic surge, jumping over 90% in a single day of trading. The rally was triggered after the company was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze against investors betting against the stock. This follows a separate announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart. The stock, which had fallen to penny-stock status after years of poor performance, saw a remarkable turnaround, highlighting the continued volatility and influence of retail traders in the market.

          <p>General Motors boosted its financial outlook for 2025 after reporting third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to soar over 15%. The automaker raised its guidance for adjusted earnings and free cash flow, signaling confidence for the remainder of the year. CEO Mary Barra attributed the strong performance to the company's team and compelling vehicle portfolio. However, the company also noted that profitability for its electric vehicles is taking longer than anticipated, highlighting ongoing challenges in the EV market transition despite recent market share gains.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to announce further interest rate cuts, top financial advisors are recommending strategies for investors to adapt their portfolios. Some suggest focusing on intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds to lock in higher yields before rates fall further. Advisors emphasize maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes rather than chasing specific industry trends, as it's difficult to predict which sectors will outperform. The overall sentiment is to balance optimism with caution, as the current rate-cutting cycle occurs within a relatively strong economy, unlike previous post-crisis environments.

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly disputed claims made by David Sacks, President Donald Trump's AI czar, who accused the company of promoting a "woke" agenda and engaging in regulatory capture. Amodei stated that Anthropic is aligned with the Trump administration on key AI policy areas and is open to collaboration. The controversy arose after Sacks criticized an essay by an Anthropic co-founder and accused the company of using fear-mongering to push for state-level regulations. Amodei clarified that Anthropic prefers a uniform federal approach to AI legislation over a patchwork of state laws.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected as Japan's first-ever female prime minister, marking a historic moment for the country. An ultraconservative member of the Liberal Democratic Party, Takaichi is known for her hawkish policies on China, support for traditional gender roles, and admiration for former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Despite her conservative social views, she is also known for her interest in heavy metal music. Her rise to power signals a rightward shift in Japanese politics and has drawn attention to her controversial views, including her stance on Japan's World War II history and immigration.</p>

          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, student loan borrowers can still access several resources for assistance. The Department of Education's website, Studentaid.gov, remains operational for tasks like applying for repayment plans or loan consolidation. Furthermore, since student loan servicers are government contractors, their call centers and operations for processing payments, forbearance, and deferment requests should continue as normal. For additional help, borrowers can contact nonprofit organizations, state student loan ombudsmen, or file complaints with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as most direct Education Department staff are furloughed.</p>

          <p>Indonesia has agreed to transfer Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother sentenced to death for drug trafficking in 2013, back to the United Kingdom on humanitarian grounds. Sandiford, who is now in her late 60s and seriously ill, has been on death row in Bali for over a decade. The agreement, signed by senior ministers from both countries, also includes the repatriation of another British national serving a life sentence for drug offenses. This move is part of a recent trend by Indonesia's administration to release or repatriate several high-profile foreign detainees convicted on drug charges.</p>

          <p>The latest population estimate for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale shows a small increase to 384 individuals, representing slow growth over the past four years. Researchers at the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium called this "positive news" but emphasized that the species remains dangerously close to extinction. Conservation groups noted that there have been no reported whale deaths this year and fewer detected injuries from vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement. Advocates are urging the federal government to implement stronger, science-based protections to ensure the fragile recovery continues.</p>
