        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers in 2025 is projected to be $1,976, though actual payments vary widely based on earnings history and the age at which benefits are claimed. While the maximum possible benefit can reach $5,108 for high earners who delay until age 70, many retirees find the standard payment insufficient to cover all living expenses. The article outlines several strategies to boost retirement income, such as purchasing annuities for a guaranteed stream of payments, utilizing a reverse mortgage, or delaying Social Security claims to receive larger monthly checks.

          <p>NBCUniversal has announced its most successful NFL season to date in terms of advertising revenue, having already sold out all commercial spots for Super Bowl LX, which will air in February. The company also reports that 90% of its ad inventory for its "Sunday Night Football" broadcasts is sold, with nearly 40 new brand partners this season. This success underscores the immense value of live sports, particularly the NFL, as a reliable driver of massive audiences and premium advertising dollars for both traditional television and streaming platforms. Commercials for the upcoming Super Bowl are reportedly commanding prices of $8 million for a 30-second spot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan coalition of House members has introduced a new bill aimed at banning lawmakers, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The legislation would require members to divest their holdings within 180 days of the law's enactment, with a 10% fine for non-compliance. This renewed effort seeks to address long-standing concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the perception that members of Congress may profit from nonpublic information. With support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and President Trump, proponents believe the reform has a strong chance of passing in 2025.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer warned investors against being misled by what he calls false narratives suggesting the Federal Reserve must cut interest rates to prevent a recession. He argued that with bond yields falling, investors should be buying stocks, not selling them or flocking to recession-resistant assets. Cramer pointed to a recent antitrust ruling favorable to Alphabet and Apple as a positive sign for megacap tech stocks. He believes the market is nearly oversold and that continued bets on an impending economic downturn are misguided, urging investors to await key data like the upcoming monthly jobs report.

          <h2>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller Advocates for September Interest Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential candidate for Fed chair, has publicly supported an interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in September. He warned that labor markets can deteriorate quickly and argued for preemptive action, suggesting multiple cuts could follow over the next three to six months. Waller, who dissented from the Fed's decision to hold rates steady in July, believes current rates are too restrictive. While declining to comment on President Trump's attempt to fire a fellow governor, he emphasized that the Fed's independence is critical and will be maintained regardless of leadership.

          <p>Amazon is ending its Prime Invitee program on October 1, which allowed Prime members to share their free shipping benefits with individuals outside their household. The company is encouraging these users to purchase their own subscriptions, offering a discounted first year at $14.99. This move is being replaced by the Amazon Family program, which limits benefit sharing to one other adult and children within the same household. While the Invitee program only covered shipping, Amazon Family allows for the sharing of a broader range of benefits, including Prime Video and Amazon Music, with the designated household member.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This is the first time such evidence, derived from whole genome sequencing of degraded and rootless hair samples, will be admissible in a New York court. Prosecutors used the cutting-edge technique to link Heuermann and his family members to hairs found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is unlicensed in the state, but the decision marks a significant victory for the prosecution and sets a precedent for future cases.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Longer-Term CDs May Offer Higher Returns Despite Lower Interest Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When considering where to deposit a significant sum like $50,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate is not always the highest one. Currently, short-term CDs of one year or less offer higher interest rates, with top 6-month CDs yielding around 4.45%. However, longer-term CDs, such as a 2-year CD at 4.10%, can generate substantially more total interest due to the extended compounding period. Savers must decide whether their priority is securing the highest possible rate for a short duration or maximizing their overall earnings over a longer, more predictable term.

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the U.S. Open semifinals after a contentious four-set victory over Taylor Fritz, the last American man in the tournament. Throughout the match, Djokovic faced an unusually hostile crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium, which cheered his faults and disrupted his focus. At one point, a frustrated Djokovic confronted the chair umpire about the noise before ultimately winning the match and blowing kisses to the booing spectators. The 38-year-old will now face Carlos Alcaraz, as the American drought for a men's Grand Slam singles title, dating back to 2003, continues.</p>
