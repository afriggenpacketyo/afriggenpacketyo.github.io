          <p>In an interview, former President Donald Trump indicated he might consider an executive order to rename soccer to football in the United States, aligning with global terminology. The comments were made during the FIFA Club World Cup final, where Trump made a surprise appearance on stage with the winning team, Chelsea. He praised the sport's unifying quality, describing it as being about "love" between countries and a force that can bring the world together. The discussion comes as the U.S. prepares to co-host the FIFA World Cup next year, further cementing the sport's presence in the country.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Receives Trump Administration Approval to Sell Advanced AI Chips to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 05:14:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that the Trump administration has approved the company's request to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. The decision is a significant policy shift, aimed at allowing U.S. companies to compete in the vast Chinese market, which is home to half of the world's AI researchers. While the move is expected to boost Nvidia's revenue, some Chinese analysts remain cautious, citing the Trump administration's history of abrupt policy changes. The development highlights the ongoing tension between U.S. national security concerns and the economic interests of American tech giants.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially entered the Indian market, launching its Model Y electric SUV at a starting price of nearly $70,000, significantly higher than in other countries. The steep price is largely due to India's high import tariffs and luxury taxes, positioning the vehicle in the premium segment against competitors like BMW rather than the mass market. Analysts suggest Tesla is currently "testing the waters" and building its brand presence with new showrooms in Mumbai and New Delhi, rather than aiming for high sales volumes. A larger commitment to local manufacturing, which could lower prices, is not expected until India's EV market and policies mature further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brentford has officially signed veteran England midfielder Jordan Henderson to a two-year contract, marking a significant move for the Premier League club. The 35-year-old former Liverpool captain joins Brentford after short stints with Saudi Arabian side Al-Ettifaq and Dutch club Ajax, where his contract was terminated early. Henderson brings extensive experience, having won numerous major titles with Liverpool, including the Premier League and Champions League. His return to English football follows a recent recall to the England national team, for which he has earned 84 caps, adding a seasoned presence to Brentford's midfield.</p>

          <p>In her new book, "The Dry Season," author Melissa Febos chronicles her decision to abstain from sex and dating for a year at age 35 to reset her relationship with intimacy. Following a devastating breakup, Febos found that withdrawing her energy from romantic pursuits allowed her to focus on herself, her friendships, and her creative work. She explains that the experience was not about lack but about rediscovering sensuality in other areas of life, such as nature and art. This period of celibacy ultimately led her to a healthier understanding of her own needs and a more profound connection with her now-wife.</p>

          <p>After an initial loss to France, England's Lionesses have secured a place in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with strong wins against the Netherlands and Wales. A statistical comparison to their victorious 2022 campaign reveals interesting trends. While they've scored fewer goals overall, more players have contributed to the tally, and their attack has become more focused down the right flank to utilize Lauren James. Defensively, they have conceded more goals than in the entire 2022 tournament, but their performance improved significantly after the opening match. Manager Sarina Wiegman has also been more willing to make tactical substitutions and lineup changes this year.</p>

          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland-listed counterparts in nearly five years. This narrowing gap, tracked by a Hang Seng gauge, reflects stronger performance in the Hong Kong market, driven by global investors diversifying away from a weaker U.S. dollar. Additionally, mainland Chinese investors have been increasing their purchases of Hong Kong-listed H-shares, particularly in major tech companies poised to benefit from advances in artificial intelligence. Analysts remain positive on Hong Kong stocks due to their relatively low valuations and expected capital inflows. (not investment advice)</p>

The updated framework will include teaching students to recognize misogyny, understand the harms of AI-generated "deepfakes," and identify unhealthy attitudes toward consent. It also emphasizes teaching pupils how to find positive male role models. The guidance moves away from strict age limits for topics, instead outlining what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school, while giving parents the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>
