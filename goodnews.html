          <p>The US and UK have reached a trade agreement aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports, while the UK secures concessions on car and steel exports. President Trump hailed the deal as a breakthrough, emphasizing reciprocity and fairness in international trade. However, a 10% tariff on most UK goods remains in place, and some analysts view the substantive benefits as limited. The agreement includes provisions for the UK to export 100,000 cars annually to the US with a reduced tariff and removes additional tariffs on steel and aluminum, signaling a potential approach for future trade negotiations with other countries.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a reevaluation of World War II history, challenging the traditional Western-centric perspective that marks 1939 as the war's starting point. They propose that Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, escalating into a full-scale war in China by 1937, should be recognized as the true beginning. This revisionist view aims to highlight and elevate China's role in the war against fascism. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, with countries worldwide holding commemorations, including President Xi Jinping's attendance at Moscow's Victory Day parade.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly ready to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S., proposing zero tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis. This marks a significant shift from India's protectionist stance, which has historically relied on high import duties. The U.S. tariffs on Indian exports appear to have prompted this change. Experts believe that reducing trade barriers is crucial for India's economic growth, facilitating foreign investment and access to global markets. Concerns remain about the potential impact on domestic manufacturing, but some analysts suggest that certain sectors may not be significantly affected.</p>

          <p>A chainsaw-wielding vandal cut down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles, prompting a police investigation that led to the arrest of 44-year-old Samuel Patrick Groft. The bizarre crime spree, which initially went unnoticed, sparked outrage after images of the downed trees circulated on social media. Tips and surveillance footage helped police identify Groft, who was found in possession of a spray-painted electric chainsaw. Groft has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges, and the motive for the tree cuttings remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported a disappointing first quarter due to inclement weather, but strong sales in April are giving investors hope. Despite missing earnings estimates, revenue exceeded expectations, and the company reaffirmed most of its 2025 outlook. The company's comparable sales at company restaurants increased 5% year over year through the first five weeks of the second quarter, driven by traffic growth and pricing. However, the company raised its commodity cost inflation outlook to approximately 4%, which is the high end of its previous guidance of 3% to 4%.</p>

Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US.

After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth. Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.</p>
