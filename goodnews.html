          <p>OpenAI is exhibiting an unparalleled dominance in the tech industry, rapidly expanding its influence across various sectors from data center development to consumer applications. The privately held company, led by CEO Sam Altman, has achieved a $500 billion valuation and boasts 800 million weekly users for its ChatGPT chatbot. This rapid growth and extensive investment across the AI stack, including recent deals with major tech players and the launch of new products like Sora AI video app, is creating a "gold rush mentality" but also uncertainty for smaller startups. Experts note the speed of disruption is faster than ever, with OpenAI's deep capital and vertical integration challenging traditional market dynamics.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight David Allen suffered a unanimous points defeat against Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a raucous Sheffield Arena. Despite a passionate 9,000-strong home crowd, the 33-year-old Allen, who had returned to the sport with titles in mind after a five-year hiatus, faced his toughest opponent yet in the imposing Makhmudov. Allen showed resilience, landing significant body shots and uppercuts, particularly sparking to life in the ninth round. Although he pushed hard in the final round, it was not enough to secure a victory. This marks another setback in Allen's career, but he expressed determination to continue, having previously rebuilt his career over the past four years.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops in the Chicago area, upholding a lower court's ruling against the White House's request. The Trump administration sought to deploy approximately 500 federalized National Guard soldiers from Texas and Illinois to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities amidst ongoing protests. While the court's order keeps troops off Chicago streets, it granted the administration's request to temporarily keep these federalized troops under federal control. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul hailed the decision as a victory for the state and local law enforcement, emphasizing the protection of community rights to protest.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to reflect evolving high-level policy priorities and a new approach to infrastructure spending and investment. Previous plans, such as the 4-trillion-yuan stimulus package in 2009, fueled massive economic growth and connected vast populations, though they also contributed to local government debt. Despite these concerns, officials and government advisers still see considerable value in these investments. Economists remain bullish on the scale of infrastructure spending over the next half-decade, noting projects are likely to become more tech-driven and people-focused to meet the demands of a new era.</p>

The summit follows a U.S.-brokered ceasefire that took effect Friday morning, involving the release of Hamas-held hostages and Palestinian prisoners. Starmer will join over 20 leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, to mark a "historic turning point" for the region and call for swift progress on phase two of the truce. The article notes that while the first phase of the deal is underway, subsequent phases concerning Gaza's governance, Israeli troop withdrawal, and Hamas disarmament will require further complex negotiations.</p>

          <p>China's recent launch of a commercial underwater data center in Hainan marks a significant step in its AI development, aiming to upgrade digital services and attract foreign investment. However, this article argues that enduring global AI leadership requires more, especially given the rapid data center expansion in the UAE and the US. The Trump administration's multibillion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, including the Stargate UAE AI data center, demonstrate a strategic convergence between investment and supply chain demands. The pace and scale of Washington’s interventions, combined with greater capital from corporate investors, pose a significant challenge to China's bid to lead the data center industry in the near term.</p>
