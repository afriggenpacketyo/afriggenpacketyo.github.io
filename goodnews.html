          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and subsequently released on bail. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received from her community and emphasized her faith in the American justice system. Her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was detained for co-authoring an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas. A federal judge ordered her release, stating there was no evidence to justify her detainment besides the op-ed, and leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her return, with Governor Healey denouncing the Trump administration's attempt to silence dissent.</p>

          <p>As tensions escalated between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, the Trump administration grew concerned about a potential nuclear conflict. Vice President JD Vance initially dismissed the conflict as not America's problem, but the administration quickly mobilized after evidence of intensifying military engagements, including strikes near Pakistan's nuclear command headquarters. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio engaged in direct diplomacy with leaders from both countries, urging de-escalation and proposing alternatives to continued strikes. President Trump then announced a cease-fire, crediting U.S. leadership, though India did not acknowledge U.S. involvement in the resolution.</p>

Ozturk, whose student visa was canceled, was detained after writing an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Supporters argued her detention violated the First Amendment. Judge William K. Sessions III emphasized the potential chilling effect on free speech, and Ozturk's lawyers highlighted her worsening asthma during confinement.

The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, aimed to de-escalate trade tensions, although initial discussions focused on "de-escalation, not about the big trade deal." Trump suggested the U.S. could lower tariffs on China, potentially to 80%, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to drop its "unilateral" tariffs first. Bessent also reported "very productive" trade talks with Switzerland, with potential for significant Swiss investments in the U.S.</p>
