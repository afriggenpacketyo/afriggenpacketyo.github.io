          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is set to revolutionize astronomy with the largest digital camera ever constructed, capable of capturing vast portions of the night sky with unprecedented detail. This powerful instrument will enable scientists to conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), a ten-year project to map the southern sky. The data collected will help researchers study dark matter, dark energy, and the formation of the Milky Way galaxy. Furthermore, the observatory's advanced capabilities will be crucial for identifying and tracking potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids, significantly enhancing planetary defense efforts and our fundamental understanding of the cosmos.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders selected defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the number one overall pick in the NHL draft during a poignant ceremony. The 17-year-old from Ontario, known for his strong puck-moving and defensive skills, has persevered through significant personal tragedy, including the death of his mother from cancer 16 months ago. In a touching gesture, the Islanders added a pink breast cancer awareness ribbon and his mother's initials to his jersey. Schaefer became emotional on stage, kissing the ribbon and pointing to the sky, later expressing his gratitude and promising not to disappoint the organization that showed such class and compassion.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a commanding 54-7 win against the Western Force, scoring eight tries in front of a record rugby crowd in Perth. Despite a competitive first half where the Force controlled territory, the Lions were ruthlessly efficient, leading 21-7 at halftime. The second half was a different story, as the tourists ran rampant with five unanswered tries, showcasing their offensive power. However, the victory was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries before being forced off the field, creating a potential depth issue for the team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary was not in spite of his pro-Palestinian stance, but because of it. The author contends that years of grassroots organizing by Palestinian allies and student activists have shifted public opinion, making support for Palestine a viable, and even powerful, political position within progressive circles. The campaign's success is credited to a dedicated base of volunteers already organized around issues like divestment from Israel, who saw Mamdani as an alternative to an establishment that overlooks the Palestinian cause. The win is framed as a testament to the growing influence of this movement on domestic American politics.</p>

          <p>Stablecoins are rapidly moving from a niche crypto-asset to the corporate and policy mainstream, with major firms like Visa, Mastercard, and JPMorgan launching their own tokens. These companies see stablecoins as a way to slash transaction fees and offer instantaneous, 24/7 settlement, fundamentally reshaping how money moves. This corporate adoption is bolstered by growing political support, exemplified by the Senate's GENIUS Act, a bipartisan bill aiming to create a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. While some lawmakers raise concerns about potential illicit use and conflicts of interest, the trend indicates a significant shift toward integrating blockchain technology into the core of the financial system.

CEO Steve Huffman argues that while AI offers sterile answers, Reddit provides authentic human interaction, which will remain valuable.

The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) recently placed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By researching historical records and collecting soil from lynching sites, the group aims to confront a painful past that has long been ignored. Members, some with personal family connections to the violence, see the work as a crucial form of resistance against current efforts to suppress the teaching of Black history.</p>

The new store is 40% bigger and features a spacious underground parking garage, a major draw for shoppers frustrated with the old, cramped lot.

          <p>In a historic policy shift, Germany is planning a massive increase in military spending with the goal of creating Europe's strongest armed forces. This dramatic reversal is driven by the war in Ukraine and the prospect of a new Trump presidency, which has raised doubts about U.S. security commitments. The German government plans to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense, changing its constitution to allow for a special $117 billion fund to modernize its beleaguered military. This move signals a profound change in Germany's post-war identity, which has long been defined by military restraint, and aims to meet the demands of its NATO partners.</p>

The article invokes the history of the movement, noting that trailblazers like the activists at Stonewall and early political candidates were often the most flamboyant and non-conforming members. It concludes that progress has always been won by a diverse coalition, not by a sanitized, monolithic group.</p>
