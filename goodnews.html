          <p>Amid rising concerns over reliance on US payment giants like Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal, the European Central Bank is urging Europe to reduce vulnerabilities in its digital payment infrastructure. ECB President Christine Lagarde advocates for a European alternative to maintain control over digital payments, citing security risks and potential economic pressure. While some experts downplay the dominance of US systems, the rise of app-based payments through American tech firms exacerbates the issue. Russia's model of domestic payment processing offers a temporary solution, but the digital euro project and initiatives like Wero face hurdles in gaining traction and widespread adoption.

          <p>China appears to be reversing its unofficial ban on K-pop acts, signaling a potential easing of restrictions after South Korea's deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Air Defense missile defense system in 2016. The move is seen as part of China's strategy to revitalize domestic demand amid a prolonged consumption downturn, with K-pop viewed as a tariff-proof sector due to its digital and intangible revenue streams. Analysts also suggest that China may seek to restore ties with neighboring countries, including South Korea, with cultural diplomacy emerging as a key starting point. The developments could be good news for K-pop stocks, providing a substantial boost to the concert market should the ban be lifted. Optimism score: 70</p>

Travelers at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., expressed that the extra cost of a REAL ID was not a priority, especially with valid passports already in hand. Others mentioned that they would wait until their current driver's licenses expired before renewing with the REAL ID option.
