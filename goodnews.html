          <h2>Japanese Survey Reveals Impact of Surname Law on Common-Law Unions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships choose not to legally marry due to the country's law requiring couples to adopt the same surname. The survey, conducted by Asuniwa, found that this figure rises to around 40% among those in their 20s, with over 60% of this group stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. While the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan supports allowing separate surnames, conservative members of the Liberal Democratic Party oppose the change, fearing it would negatively impact traditional family values. The survey estimates that approximately 1.22 million people aged 20 to 59 are in common-law relationships, with 587,000 wishing to marry if separate surnames were an option.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are considering a proposal to explore a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians. Sparked by concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime, the idea reflects a broader debate about generational change in politics. While some support the move to make way for younger leaders, others view it as ageist and discriminatory. The proposal will be discussed at the California Democratic Party convention, though its passage and implementation face significant hurdles.</p>
