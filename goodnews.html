          <p>President Trump wrapped up a five-day foreign trip to Scotland, largely centered on promoting his family's luxury golf properties, by officially opening a new golf course bearing his name in Balmedie. The visit, which also included a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss a trade deal framework with the EU, allowed Trump to escape Washington's political climate. The article notes that this trip continues a pattern of the president using his office to promote his brand, with his sons managing the family business while he is in the White House.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has confirmed that the club has not yet received any formal bids for their top scorer, Alexander Isak, despite reports of interest from other clubs like Liverpool. Isak, who joined Newcastle in 2022 for approximately £60 million and has three years remaining on his contract, is exploring options for a potential summer move. Howe stated that while he doesn't have full control over the player's future, his wish is for Isak to remain with the club, emphasizing his importance after scoring 62 goals in 109 appearances.</p>

          <h2>Perseid Meteor Shower Peak Diminished by Bright Moon This Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseid meteor shower, known for its quantity and showy fireballs, is set to peak on the night of August 11-12. However, this year's viewing experience will be significantly compromised by a nearly full waning gibbous moon, which will be about 92% illuminated. Experts warn that the moon's glow will obscure fainter meteors, reducing the typical hourly rate of 50-100. Stargazers committed to observing the shower are advised to seek locations far from urban light pollution and hope for brighter fireballs, a phenomenon for which the Perseids are famous.</p>
