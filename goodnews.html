          <p>The Kremlin has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to hold a bilateral meeting in the near future. According to Putin's adviser, Yuri Ushakov, the summit was arranged following a proposal from the American side and work on its preparation has commenced. The announcement followed a meeting between Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, which Trump described as highly productive in efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Ushakov also noted that while a trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had been suggested, the upcoming summit will be exclusively between the U.S. and Russian leaders.</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reached an agreement with Liverpool to sign Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez for a fee of £46.3 million (53m euros). Nunez, who joined the Premier League club in 2022 for an initial £64 million, is now set to undergo a medical before finalizing the move. Despite scoring 40 goals in 143 appearances, he had limited starting opportunities in Liverpool's recent title-winning season. The sale is expected to provide Liverpool with a significant financial boost as they pursue other transfer targets, including Newcastle's Alexander Isak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a query about managing the urge to shop, NPR readers have shared a variety of personal strategies for exercising self-control. Common tactics include implementing a waiting period by leaving items in an online cart or on a wishlist to see if the desire persists over time. Other creative approaches involve turning shopping into a game by picking out items without buying them or satisfying the 'thrill of the hunt' at a library or thrift store. The suggestions emphasize a shift towards more intentional consumption, with some readers advocating for finding deeper, non-material sources of fulfillment to transform the impulse to buy altogether.</p>

          <p>The tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons, once a niche hobby, has exploded into a popular form of spectator entertainment, selling out large venues like Madison Square Garden. This phenomenon, known as 'actual play,' features comedians and actors playing D&D for live and online audiences, attracting millions of viewers. Shows like 'Dimension 20' and 'Critical Role' have driven this growth, fostering a more diverse player base that now includes as many women as men. This new era of visibility is credited with fueling a golden age for the game, encouraging more people than ever to start their own home-based D&D groups.</p>

          <p>The National Football League has officially banned the use of smelling salts by players on the field, citing significant safety concerns. The league's decision is based on FDA warnings and the risk that the substance can mask the symptoms of serious injuries like concussions. Smelling salts, which are ammonia inhalants, create a physiological jolt that some athletes use for a perceived increase in alertness. However, there is no scientific evidence they enhance performance, and their use can lead to a player with a concussion making their injury worse by triggering a sudden head movement or returning to play prematurely.</p>

          <h2>Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown Advocates for Higher Gambling Taxes to Fund Social Programs</h2>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is urging Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase taxes on the gambling industry to finance the removal of benefit restrictions for families. Brown argues that the 'undertaxed' gambling sector is a straightforward source of revenue to address the 'social crisis' of child poverty. He supports a proposal from the IPPR think tank to raise taxes on online gambling, which could generate an estimated £3.2 billion annually. This amount would be sufficient to scrap the two-child benefit cap and the overall benefit cap, measures that anti-poverty groups have long campaigned against. (not investment advice)</p>

For students already at IU seeking standard admission, the minimum grade required in all courses will be raised from a B to a B+ for the 2025-26 cohort, and further to an A- for the 2026-27 cohort. Additionally, starting in fall 2026, the school will eliminate automatic direct admission for high school applicants based on GPA and test scores. Instead, it will adopt a comprehensive review process that evaluates overall potential, academic rigor, and expressed interest in business through a new inventory form.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As climate change fuels more frequent and intense wildfires globally, experts are focusing on strategies to make forests more resilient to fire. Key methods include converting flammable monocultures, like pine or eucalyptus, back into more fire-resistant native deciduous forests. In the short term, reducing 'fuel loads' by clearing dry undergrowth through mowing, grazing, or controlled burns is crucial. Other tactics involve creating and maintaining wide, vegetation-free firebreaks, which can be watered to slow a fire's advance. These proactive forest management techniques are seen as essential for adapting to a hotter, drier planet where fire is an increasing threat.</p>

          <p>SoftBank Group has reported its second straight quarter of profit, largely driven by a significant $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Fund technology investment arm. The Japanese conglomerate's fiscal first-quarter profit of 421.8 billion yen far exceeded analyst expectations. The positive performance of the Vision Fund was attributed to gains in publicly traded companies like Grab and private investments in firms such as Indian food delivery service Swiggy. This result will be welcomed by investors as the company continues to make substantial, high-profile investments in the artificial intelligence sector, including a proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the tendency of political leaders and institutions to seek rigid control is ill-suited for tackling today's complex 'polycrisis' of climate breakdown, economic instability, and rising fascism. The author suggests that this 'power over' mindset stifles creativity and prevents meaningful change. Instead, she advocates for leaders and institutions to 'let go' and 'embrace uncertainty,' a concept usually confined to self-help. Applying this to governance could foster collaboration, pluralist thinking, and humility, creating more resilient democracies capable of navigating a world characterized by radical uncertainty and surprise.</p>
