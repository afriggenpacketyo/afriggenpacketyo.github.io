          <p>While digging trenches in Lima, Peru, utility workers unexpectedly discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy in a remarkable state of preservation, including a full head of dark brown hair. Archaeologists believe the remains belong to a woman from the Chancay culture, which predates the Inca Empire by several centuries. The discovery highlights the rich archaeological heritage of the Peruvian coast, where the dry desert climate naturally mummifies remains. The city of Lima alone is home to approximately 400 archaeological sites, making such finds not uncommon.</p>

The 39-year-old fighter described the modest, low-key event as a "new beginning" as he aims to rebuild his career and confidence.

          <p>According to a top economist at China International Capital Corporation, China's ubiquitous third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay provide the nation with a significant comparative advantage in the global race to develop stablecoins. The argument posits that these platforms already function much like stablecoins, as they are extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency and are backed by central bank reserves. This existing infrastructure and its mature regulatory framework could allow China to stay ahead in the evolving field of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>
