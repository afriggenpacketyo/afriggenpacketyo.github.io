        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists and hairstylists are advising against going to bed with wet hair, citing several health and cosmetic risks. When hair is wet, it becomes more fragile and susceptible to breakage from friction against a pillowcase, leading to split ends and long-term damage. Furthermore, the damp, warm environment created on the scalp overnight is an ideal breeding ground for fungi and bacteria. This can lead to scalp irritation, dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, or folliculitis, while also potentially transferring bacteria to pillowcases and contributing to facial skin breakouts.</p>

          <h2>FICO to Incorporate 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Loan Data into Credit Scores</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit scoring company FICO will begin incorporating data from "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) loans into some of its credit scores this fall, reflecting the growing popularity of installment payment services. This change aims to give lenders a more complete financial picture, potentially helping some consumers build credit while penalizing those who make late payments. The move addresses a blind spot for lenders, but it also highlights that BNPL services often lack the same consumer protections as traditional credit cards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes highlighted the blockchain's growing integration into mainstream finance, with major institutions building on its infrastructure. Robinhood announced it would offer tokenized U.S. stocks on an Ethereum-based network, causing its stock to surge, while Deutsche Bank is developing a tokenization platform on a similar network. Despite market volatility, institutions are reportedly drawn to Ethereum for its stability, security, and decade-long operational record without downtime. This institutional adoption signals a shift from speculative hype to practical utility, positioning Ethereum as a core component of future financial systems. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in renewable energy by launching a large-scale floating solar power station in the coastal waters of Qingdao, Shandong province. Developed by state-owned Sinopec, the project is part of a broader initiative that, combined with a similar project from May, will form a massive offshore photovoltaic power generator. The two projects are expected to generate 16.7 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, which will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 14,000 tonnes. The panels' proximity to the water's surface also helps cool them, boosting their energy generation efficiency.</p>

          <p>Wales suffered its 18th consecutive international loss, falling 24-19 to Japan in a match played in extremely hot and humid conditions in Kitakyushu. Despite leading 19-7 at halftime, the Welsh team wilted in the second half as Japan, led by captain Michael Leitch, mounted a comeback. The game featured multiple water breaks and an extended halftime to cope with the severe weather. A 71st-minute try by Halatoa Vailea sealed the victory for Eddie Jones' Japanese side, dropping Wales to a historic low of 14th in world rankings.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest and its champion, Joey Chestnut, framing the event as an honest, if bizarre, reflection of American culture. The author describes the contest as a spectacle of excess and self-loathing that cuts directly to the consumerist core of many American activities. While acknowledging the grotesque nature of competitive eating, the article also views it as a form of punkish satire, holding a mirror to a society obsessed with consumption. The piece argues that sport, even in this extreme form, reveals something profound about national character and its dysfunctions.</p>

          <p>The long-standing debate over whether people from different cultures perceive the world differently has been revisited by two recent studies with conflicting findings. One study found that people from Western societies were more likely to see rectangles in the Coffer illusion, while people from rural Namibia tended to see circles, supporting the "carpentered world" hypothesis. However, another study dismantled this explanation for the well-known Müller-Lyer illusion, showing it affects non-human animals and even people blind from birth. The discrepancy suggests that perceptual diversity is complex and that we all live in perceptual echo chambers shaped by our unique experiences.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, public swimming is officially permitted in designated areas of the Seine River in Paris. The reopening is a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics, for which the city invested approximately €1.4 billion to improve water quality and reduce pollution from sewage and urban runoff. Three supervised swimming zones have been established with changing rooms, showers, and lifeguards, offering residents and tourists a new way to cool off. This milestone fulfills a long-standing promise by city officials to clean up the iconic river for public enjoyment and climate adaptation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have successfully restored damaged outer ear tissue in mice by activating what they describe as a disabled "genetic switch." The study, published in the journal 'Science,' found that the mice's inability to regenerate was linked to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. By reactivating this pathway, scientists were able to achieve complete restoration of lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application remains a distant goal, the findings offer significant hope and provide a new direction for research into organ regeneration in mammals.</p>

While the patient's experience was positive, his surgeon warns that AI can be unreliable and should not replace professional medical advice.
