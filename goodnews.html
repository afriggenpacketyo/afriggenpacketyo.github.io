          <p>The leading candidates for New York City mayor—Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa—clashed in a televised debate covering major city issues. Key topics included housing affordability, city noise, and the influence of President Donald Trump on federal-city relations. Mamdani, the progressive frontrunner, defended his pro-Palestinian views against criticism from Cuomo, who positioned himself as an experienced centrist capable of managing the White House. The debate highlighted the deep ideological divides within the race as early voting approaches, with affordability remaining a central concern for New Yorkers.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced it will roll out new parental controls for its AI characters on platforms like Instagram and Facebook, responding to an inquiry from the Federal Trade Commission. The upcoming features, expected early next year, will allow parents to monitor their teens' interactions, block specific AI characters, and disable one-on-one chats entirely. This move follows criticism and reports that the company's AI chatbots engaged in inappropriate conversations with minors. Meta is implementing these changes to enhance safety and address concerns about the potential harm of AI companions on young users.</p>

          <p>Forty years ago, basketball star Lynette Woodard made history by becoming the first woman to join the Harlem Globetrotters, breaking barriers in a male-dominated sport. An Olympic gold medalist and a record-setting player at the University of Kansas, Woodard was selected from a pool of 60 women who tried out in 1985. Her two-year tenure with the iconic team paved the way for future female players and further solidified her legacy as a trailblazer. After her time with the Globetrotters, Woodard played professionally overseas and in the WNBA, and she has since been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame twice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's attempt to prevent a judicial review of its decision to ban the direct-action group Palestine Action under terrorism laws has been rejected by the Court of Appeal. This ruling allows the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori, to proceed with a High Court challenge against the proscription, which criminalizes support for the organization. The court determined that a judicial review would be a faster and more appropriate way to assess the legality of the ban than the government's proposed internal review process. The decision is seen as a significant victory for the group and its supporters, who argue the ban is a misuse of counter-terror laws.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Rand Corporation suggests that stabilizing the rivalry between the United States and China is both possible and mutually beneficial, despite deep-seated differences. The researchers argue that while the two nations are far from ending their competition, they should seek ways to coexist to prevent the relationship from escalating to dangerous levels. The report advises that the U.S. must safeguard its interests against China's ambitions while simultaneously pursuing strategies to manage the rivalry, similar to its approach during the Cold War. It notes that there is an "opening" for coexistence if both sides can leverage it.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling more than 290,000 of its F-250, F-350, and F-450 Super Duty trucks from model years 2020-2022 due to a faulty rearview camera system. The issue is that the camera may fail to display an image under certain lighting conditions, which could increase the risk of a crash. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Ford is aware of 10 reports related to this condition but has received no reports of accidents or injuries. Dealers will update the image processing module software for free, with owner notification letters expected to be sent starting in October.</p>

Murayama is highly regarded in China for his landmark 1995 statement expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II. A foreign ministry spokesman highlighted Murayama's sense of justice and his historic visit to the Marco Polo Bridge, the site where Japan's full-scale invasion of China began in 1937. His actions are remembered as a significant contribution to fostering China-Japan friendship and acknowledging historical responsibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated that despite recent market worries over bad loans at midsize U.S. banks, there is little evidence of a systemic problem threatening the broader financial system. The concerns were sparked after Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp disclosed holdings of bad loans, causing a sell-off in bank stocks. However, the Moody's analyst noted that asset quality numbers show very little deterioration and that default rates on high-yield debt remain relatively low. The U.S. economy has also shown resilience, suggesting that fears of widespread contagion are currently unfounded. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A policy solution known as "demand flexibility" is being promoted as a bipartisan tool to manage the United States' growing energy needs while lowering household electricity bills. The approach involves rewarding customers for reducing power consumption during peak hours or for selling back stored energy from sources like home solar panels. This strategy could help accommodate the increased demand from AI data centers and manufacturing without relying on new fossil fuel infrastructure. Proponents argue it can prevent blackouts, reduce costs, and support climate goals by making more efficient use of the existing power grid.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has disabled the ability of its AI video generator, Sora, to create deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., calling some of the content "disrespectful." The decision came after a public request from Dr. King's estate and his daughter, Bernice A. King, to stop the creation of AI-generated clips of the late civil rights leader. The viral app had been used to create bizarre and offensive scenarios involving historical figures, raising ethical concerns about rewriting history and the spread of misinformation. While OpenAI has paused images of Dr. King, it still permits the creation of videos featuring other public figures.</p>

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are warning investors about common mistakes that can negatively impact their portfolios. One major error is "chasing performance" or following a herd mentality into trendy, thematic funds like AI or crypto, which are often volatile and narrowly focused. Another frequent misstep is ignoring expense ratios, as seemingly small differences in fees can significantly erode returns over time. With the ETF market surpassing $11 trillion, experts stress the importance of understanding these products and ensuring they align with long-term, diversified investment strategies rather than short-term trends.

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on her decision to marry her partner of three decades primarily to gain access to his SAG-AFTRA health insurance. The arrangement, which she once joked about in her comedy routine, became a practical necessity after she lost her own coverage. However, the "forever" promise of that insurance later vanished due to policy changes, forcing her to confront the illusion of permanence. The author draws parallels between her experience and the precariousness of life in Los Angeles, from racial covenants on property deeds to the potential overturning of legal protections, concluding that true permanence lies in choice, not paperwork.</p>
