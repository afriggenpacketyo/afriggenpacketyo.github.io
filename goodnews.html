          <h2>Expert Argues for Introducing Smartphones to Children as Young as Three</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to popular movements advocating for delaying smartphone access until middle school, some experts propose a different approach: introducing phones to children as young as three. The article suggests this should be a highly intentional and gradual process, starting with limited functions like a family photo album and slowly adding features like a camera or parent-selected audiobooks. This method aims to make technology a managed, conversational part of a child's development, teaching digital literacy from an early age. Proponents argue this strategy better prepares children for an increasingly tech-dependent world, turning the device into a tool for learning rather than a forbidden fruit.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 NFL season begins, each of the 32 teams faces unique questions and narratives that will define their campaigns. The Philadelphia Eagles start their Super Bowl title defense, while teams like the Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions face 'Super Bowl or bust' expectations after years of contention. Much attention is on quarterback development, including Kyler Murray in Arizona, Caleb Williams in Chicago, and rookie Cam Ward in Tennessee. Other major storylines include coaching changes in Dallas and New Orleans, significant offseason acquisitions like the Packers trading for Micah Parsons, and the ongoing question of whether the Kansas City Chiefs' dynasty can continue its dominance.</p>

          <p>Following China's recent Victory Day military parade, renowned mathematician Shing-Tung Yau emphasized the fundamental importance of mathematics and physics in developing advanced weaponry. In an interview, Yau stated that cutting-edge military technology, including the AI-powered drones and information warfare equipment showcased at the event, relies heavily on original innovations in basic sciences. He warned that without a strong foundation and deep accumulation in these fields, a nation's technological progress could be constrained by others. His comments underscore the strategic link between academic research and national defense, particularly as warfare becomes increasingly reliant on intelligent and sophisticated systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising popularity on social media, the article examines the scientific backing for the benefits of creatine supplements. Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate can help increase lean muscle mass and improve athletic performance, particularly in activities requiring short bursts of energy. However, these benefits are contingent on combining the supplement with resistance training. While there is emerging but less conclusive evidence for other claims, such as improved bone health and cognitive function, experts consider creatine to be very safe for most adults. They advise consumers to choose pure creatine monohydrate products certified by third-party programs to avoid adulterated supplements.</p>

          <h2>Young Eagle's Visit to Famous Big Bear Nest Sparks Speculation It's a Returning Offspring</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A juvenile bald eagle recently visited the famous Big Bear nest of eagle couple Jackie and Shadow, leading observers to believe it may be their daughter, Gizmo, who fledged earlier this summer. The young eagle exhibited several features matching Gizmo, including specific tail feather patterns, a distinctive "Mona Lisa smile," and a gap in its left wing feathers. While eaglets often return to the nest shortly after their first flight, it is unusual for one to come back months later. The visit has thrilled thousands of fans who follow the eagles on a 24-hour webcam, providing a heartwarming moment after a dramatic nesting season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread panic about students using AI to cheat, new research suggests that the overall rates of academic dishonesty have not significantly increased since the advent of tools like ChatGPT. An education researcher explains that cheating has long been prevalent, with studies from before the AI era showing high percentages of students engaging in such behaviors. Early data indicates that while some students now use AI to write entire papers, AI has primarily captured a share of the existing market for plagiarism and unauthorized assistance. The article argues for a more nuanced conversation, focusing on why students cheat and how to adapt educational goals for an AI-filled future.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka has demonstrated remarkable consistency, reaching the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam tournaments, a feat she continues at the US Open where she will face Jessica Pegula. However, her powerful style has often been undermined by mental errors at critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. This year, she has fallen short in the final or semi-final of all three previous majors. To overcome this hurdle, Sabalenka has added doubles champion Max Mirnyi to her coaching team to help manage her emotions and maintain composure during high-pressure situations.</p>

          <p>An international anti-piracy coalition, the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment (ACE), has successfully shut down Streameast, the world's largest illegal live sports streaming service. In collaboration with Egyptian police, the operation targeted the network which had garnered over 1.6 billion visits in the past year by offering pirated streams of major sports like Premier League football and Formula One. The shutdown is being hailed as a major victory for sports leagues and broadcasters who lose significant revenue to such large-scale piracy. Two men were arrested in Egypt in connection with the operation, which also uncovered a complex money laundering scheme.</p>

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta is reportedly considering a lawsuit against the Football Association (FA) after being cleared of all spot-fixing charges. The Brazilian player was accused in May 2024 of deliberately receiving yellow cards to influence betting markets, allegations that caused an £80 million transfer to Manchester City to collapse. An independent commission cleared him of all four charges, and newly published written reasons criticized the FA's investigation, particularly its reliance on an internal investigator rather than an independent betting data expert. Paqueta's legal team is now exploring all options in response to the lengthy and damaging investigation.</p>

          <p>As cars in America last longer than ever, owners of aging vehicles face a complex decision when it's time to part ways: sell, donate, or recycle. The article explores these options through the story of a 20-year-old minivan, weighing its remaining usefulness against its increasing repair costs and environmental impact. Donating a functional beater to a charity can provide transportation for a family in need. Alternatively, recycling through certified programs like SHiFT ensures that high-polluting engines are taken off the road while salvaging valuable parts for reuse and remanufacturing, minimizing landfill waste and turning an old car into a source of recycled materials.</p>
