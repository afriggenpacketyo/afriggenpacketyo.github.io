          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of more than $220 million worth of cocaine during multiple interceptions in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Operations in August and September resulted in the capture of several drug-smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America. The crew of the Cutter Midgett offloaded over 21,000 pounds of cocaine in San Diego, while the Cutter Diligence offloaded another 8,700 pounds in Florida. The Coast Guard released an image of one alleged drug boat on fire, stating it is standard procedure to sink such vessels after seizing narcotics to prevent maritime hazards.</p>

Arriving as the U.S. team was trailing in the morning matches, the president was greeted with chants of "U-S-A" from the crowd. He briefly met with golfers Bryson DeChambeau and Ben Griffin on the first tee. An avid golfer himself, Trump has remained engaged with the sport, and his presence was seen by some players as a morale boost for the U.S. team.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will permit Boeing to resume issuing its own airworthiness certificates for certain 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a sign of returning regulatory confidence. This authority was revoked in 2019 for the MAX and 2022 for the 787 following fatal crashes and production defects, respectively. Under the new arrangement, the FAA and Boeing will issue the safety certifications on alternating weeks. The regulator stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's production quality and will allow FAA inspectors to focus on other areas of surveillance, though production caps on the MAX remain in place.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 'Rule of Thirds' for Retirement Income Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 12:57:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A retirement income strategy known as the "rule of thirds" is gaining attention as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. The approach involves converting one-third of retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or kept liquid for unexpected costs. This strategy aims to balance financial security with flexibility, providing a stable income floor that may reduce stress during market volatility and allow for more confident spending in retirement.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has initiated a new position in Nike, citing confidence in the apparel company's long-term turnaround strategy under CEO Elliott Hill. The move comes after a period of underperformance for the stock, attributed to challenges in China, an overemphasis on direct-to-consumer sales, and increased competition. The "Win Now" strategy focuses on core product categories and key markets, while also repairing relationships with retail partners like Amazon. The club views the recent stock pullback as a buying opportunity, anticipating improved margins once excess inventory is cleared. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its 'Gold Card' residency program at a price of $1 million, a significant reduction from the initially proposed $5 million. This move has made the U.S. visa one of the most competitively priced 'golden visa' options globally, sparking immediate interest from wealthy individuals, particularly from China and India. The program, which promises residency in record time, aims to generate substantial federal revenue, with plans to issue 80,000 cards. However, the program faces potential legal challenges as it uses executive workarounds of existing immigration law set by Congress.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled a series of massive infrastructure partnerships, signaling its ambition to become a dominant force in AI on the scale of a hyperscaler.

CEO Sam Altman stated that delivering the next era of AI will require trillions of dollars in data center construction, acknowledging the immense execution risk and energy requirements.

          <p>A 17-year-old from Marion County, Florida, who was the subject of an Amber Alert, has been found safe. The Marion County Sheriff’s Office stated that the initial report of the teen, Caden Speight, being abducted by four men in a van appears to be untrue. Detectives gathered evidence contradicting the abduction story and now believe Speight may have left the area voluntarily on a bicycle with a tent. Although the circumstances changed, authorities continued to actively search for the teen, considering him endangered due to his age, leading to his safe recovery.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order paving the way for a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new corporate structure. The agreement satisfies a law requiring the app's China-based parent, ByteDance, to divest. Under the deal, a new U.S.-based joint venture will be formed with a majority of American investors, and Oracle will manage the security of U.S. user data and the content algorithm. The order declares the deal a "qualified divestiture" and pushes back the law's enforcement to allow time for the agreement to be finalized.</p>
