          <p>The stock market demonstrated its sensitivity to employment data with a rally following a positive update on nonfarm payrolls, after a previous downturn sparked by a feud between President Trump and Elon Musk. The U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, with the unemployment rate remaining at 4.2% and hourly wages increasing by 3.9% year-over-year, surpassing expectations. This report eased investor concerns about a potential labor market collapse, which is crucial for the consumption-based U.S. economy. The data suggests a balance where the economy is neither weak enough to signal a recession nor strong enough to deter future Federal Reserve rate cuts (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Used vehicle prices experienced a slight decrease in May, easing from the highs seen in April due to consumer concerns about potential tariff-related price increases, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. The index decreased by 1.5% from April to May but remains 4% higher than the previous year. Demand remains relatively strong due to low inventory levels, driven by consumers holding onto vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years. While tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market.</p>

State media reported that the vessel will be moved to a dry dock for repairs, with leader Kim Jong Un calling for swift action. The refloating process involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the ship's hull. Analysts had initially expected the repairs to take much longer, but the quick progress suggests that the hull damage was less severe than initially estimated, and the ship may be ready for sea trials sooner than expected.</p>
