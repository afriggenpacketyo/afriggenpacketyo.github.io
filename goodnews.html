          <p>President Donald Trump posthumously awarded conservative activist Charlie Kirk the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in a White House Rose Garden ceremony. Kirk, who would have been 32, was tragically killed on September 10 while speaking at Utah Valley University during the first stop of his "The American Comeback Tour." Trump lauded Kirk as a "fearless warrior for liberty" and a "giant of his generation," noting his profound influence among young conservatives and his role as a key ally. The ceremony, held on Kirk's birthday and attended by his wife Erika, took place shortly after Trump returned from brokering a significant ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is close to ending its "quantitative tightening" program, which reduces its bond holdings, and hinted at further interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to business economists, Powell noted that a considerable softening in the labor market has shifted the balance of risks towards employment concerns over inflation. While not committing to specific dates, his comments suggest the Fed is prioritizing job market stability. The central bank has been reducing its balance sheet since mid-2022, and Powell emphasized the need for "ample" bank reserves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite increased flight delays caused by air traffic controller shortages during the U.S. government shutdown, aviation experts firmly reassure the public that air travel remains safe. The Federal Aviation Administration is proactively implementing ground delays as a precautionary measure, prioritizing safety even as controllers are mandated to work without pay. While acknowledging the inconvenience, experts emphasize that pilots ultimately hold the final authority on flight safety, and FAA standards are not compromised. However, concerns persist regarding the potential long-term impact of unpaid work on controller performance and morale.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals a stark disconnect between Gen Z's top values—self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping people—and the priorities of hiring managers, who seek achievement, learning, and hard work. With only 2% of Gen Z aligning with employer values, frustration is prevalent on both sides. A CEO offers practical advice for "unemployable" Gen Zers, urging them to honestly assess their financial needs and consider temporarily adopting a more "work-centric" approach. This strategy, embracing "delayed gratification," is presented as a necessary step for career progression and long-term success.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasts the UK will be the second-fastest-growing G7 economy in 2025, trailing only the US, but will also face the highest inflation rate among G7 nations this year and next. This inflation is primarily driven by escalating energy and utility bills. While overall economic growth is projected at a modest 1.3%, per capita economic output growth remains low. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged public sentiment that the economy feels "stuck," pledging to address these challenges despite the mixed economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>
