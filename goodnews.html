          <p>Burberry is set to reduce 1,700 jobs globally by 2027 as part of organizational changes amid a luxury market downturn. The company's sales fell 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly less than the anticipated 7% decline. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment and early stages of turnaround efforts, CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future growth and profitability. The company also noted geopolitical tensions as a key downside risk, particularly regarding potential tariff impacts.</p>

          <p>Sony Group's shares experienced a rise of over 2% following the announcement of a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year surpassed analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of its shares to shareholders through dividends. While the outlook for the current financial year is lackluster due to potential tariff impacts, Sony clarified that the recent trade deal between the U.S. and China could alter the actual impact.</p>

          <p>BBC Director General Tim Davie has pledged to address Britain's 'crisis of trust' by expanding fact-checking services, countering disinformation, and enhancing local journalism. Davie argues that the BBC can play a crucial role in strengthening democracy, boosting education, and improving digital access. He also proposes using artificial intelligence in the BBC's Bitesize educational service to create personalized learning companions for children. Davie calls for a national plan to transition to internet-only delivery of programs in the 2030s, potentially launching a streaming media device to aid those who haven't switched to streaming services.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in home insurance premiums following a judge's ruling and adoption by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The increase aims to provide the company with a $400 million cash infusion after destructive Los Angeles-area wildfires. Despite backlash from fire survivors and state senators, Lara assured residents that he considered all options, balancing the need to protect State Farm customers and the integrity of the insurance market. The company has also agreed to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often prioritized over other qualifications, making it difficult to find the perfect fit. Family offices also compete with banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. While salaries can be high, young employees are sometimes reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a 'retirement job'.</p>

          <p>British businesses are expressing concerns that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to 'back British workers over cheap overseas labour'. However, businesses fear that British workers are either unable or unwilling to fill the gap created by potential worker shortages. The care industry, already facing 131,000 vacancies, warns that the immigration plans could have serious consequences.</p>

Despite this decrease, egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu that has decimated egg-laying hen populations. Experts predict further price declines in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks. President Trump has focused on lowering egg prices, with the USDA investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures.</p>
