          <p>Fair Isaac, the company behind the widely used FICO credit score, experienced a significant stock rally of over 20% following the announcement of a new pricing model. This innovative model will enable mortgage lenders to directly license credit scores, effectively bypassing the traditional role of credit bureaus. The strategic shift is intended to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups on FICO scores, offering greater flexibility and choice to lenders in their mortgage decisions. While this development signals positive economic prospects for FICO, it led to a notable decline in the stock values of major credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. The Federal Housing Finance Agency director praised the initiative as a "Creative Solution" aimed at benefiting American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI successfully completed a $6.6 billion secondary share sale, valuing the artificial intelligence company at an impressive $500 billion. This transaction allowed current and former employees to sell their stock, with key investors including Thrive Capital, SoftBank, and Dragoneer Investment Group participating. The deal cements OpenAI's status as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. This strategic move is seen internally as a vote of confidence in the company's long-term prospects and a method to retain top talent amidst intensifying competition for AI expertise, without pursuing an immediate IPO.

          <h2>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal Reach New Distribution Agreement, Averting Blackout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 15:57:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have successfully finalized a new distribution agreement, thereby preventing a major programming blackout that would have impacted millions of customers. The resolution came after a period of tense negotiations where both media giants wielded considerable leverage, motivated to avoid public ire. A crucial point of contention involved YouTube TV's initial demand to integrate Peacock streaming service content into its packages for free, which NBCUniversal resisted, preferring a separate subscription model. This amicable settlement ensures that popular channels such as NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, and Bravo will remain available to YouTube TV subscribers, marking a positive outcome for consumers.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. chipmaker Intel have surged over 50% in the past month, significantly increasing the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake to approximately $16 billion. The Trump administration made an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, funded by grants from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. This remarkable rebound, coupled with recent investments from Softbank and Nvidia, signals renewed confidence in the troubled chipmaker, whose shares had hit a decade-low earlier this year. Intel is now trading at its highest level in 18 months under its current leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have made $90,000 home equity loans more affordable, with monthly payments now lower than earlier this year or last. A 10-year loan at 8.34% costs $1,108.18 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% costs $871.03. While these rates are more favorable, the article advises homeowners to also consider Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), which currently offer rates below 8%. Borrowers are encouraged to weigh the pros and cons of acting now versus waiting for further rate reductions, mindful of potential refinancing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers from Purdue University are preparing an expedition to the South Pacific, claiming "very strong" evidence suggests they have located Amelia Earhart's long-lost plane in a lagoon on Nikumaroro island. A "visual anomaly" identified as the Taraia Object, visible in satellite images since 1938, will be the focus of the November investigation using sonar and magnetometers. This potential discovery could finally confirm the theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan were marooned on the island after their 1937 disappearance. Purdue, which originally funded Earhart's aircraft, hopes to transport the plane back to the university if identified.</p>
