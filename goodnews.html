          <p>A Kyodo News survey shows Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating increased to 37%, up from 31.7% in May.  The rise is attributed to public support for a policy shift to increase rice production amid shortages and record-high prices.  The disapproval rating decreased to 48.4%, while opinions on the government's response to rising rice prices remain divided.</p>
