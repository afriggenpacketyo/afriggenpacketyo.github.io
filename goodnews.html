        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 60 weight-loss drugs are currently under trial in China, positioning the country to compete with popular medications like Ozempic in a market valued at US$150 billion. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, which is years ahead of its expiration in other global markets. This early expiration is expected to pave the way for numerous cheaper, generic alternatives from Chinese manufacturers. Analysts predict this influx of competition will significantly drive down prices, making these treatments for diabetes and obesity more affordable and accessible for a wider population.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to multiple drug trafficking and organized crime charges in a US federal court. Known as "El Raton," Guzman Lopez admitted to his role in leading the Sinaloa Cartel alongside his brothers following their father's extradition and conviction. His plea agreement includes charges of coordinating the trafficking of fentanyl, cocaine, and other substances into the US, as well as money laundering. In exchange for his cooperation with prosecutors, he is expected to receive a reduced sentence, marking a significant development for US authorities targeting cartel leadership.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Issues Temporary Order Against Allegedly Discriminatory Immigration Stops in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 21:37:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting immigration stops based on factors such as race, language, or location, ruling they likely violate the 4th Amendment. The order came in response to a lawsuit by immigrant rights groups alleging that federal agents were unlawfully targeting brown-skinned individuals in places like Home Depot parking lots and carwashes without reasonable suspicion. The judge found substantial evidence supporting these claims, which have reportedly terrorized communities and disrupted the local economy. This ruling represents a significant, albeit temporary, legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A decade after its initial release, Lord Huron's song "The Night We Met" has become an unexpected global sensation, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify. The wistful indie folk ballad, which was not a hit in 2015, gained a new life after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed, largely fueled by its widespread use in videos on TikTok, where it has been embraced for its emotionally resonant lyrics. The song's enduring and growing appeal illustrates the power of streaming and social media to resurrect older tracks and turn them into modern standards.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both appearing in the championship match for the first time. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically had an uneasy relationship with grass courts but has found formidable form during the tournament. Anisimova, a former teen prodigy who took a break from tennis for her mental health, is now realizing her potential with an aggressive, free-swinging style. The final will likely hinge on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's underdog freedom.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine of 'Australia first,' aiming to recalibrate the nation's relationships in an era of rising global tensions. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While reaffirming the importance of the US alliance and the AUKUS security pact, the speech signals a move toward greater sovereignty and self-determination. This strategic shift comes as his government navigates the complex dynamics of its relationships with both the United States and China.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old from Massachusetts who is non-speaking due to autism and apraxia, has been accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). For the first 14 years of his life, Viraj was unable to communicate, and many assumed he was severely intellectually disabled. However, his single father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his right thumb, unlocking his ability to communicate via an iPad. This breakthrough revealed a brilliant mind, and in just three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus, graduating high school and earning a near-perfect ACT score, a victory for the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state, which alleges the social media platform uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit young users. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok is intentionally designed to keep children engaged for longer periods, increasing their exposure to ads and prompting purchases. The judge ruled that the state's claims about the app's defective and dangerous features were specific enough to move forward. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions targeting the design of tech platforms rather than their user-generated content.</p>
