          <p>Experts suggest that affordable credit card interest rates are unlikely in the near future due to the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to rate cuts and lenders' concerns about default risks. The article highlights that even if the Fed begins cutting rates, card issuers will consider factors such as delinquency rates and operating margins before lowering APRs. Consumers are advised to explore debt repayment strategies, hardship rate reductions, and debt consolidation options to manage their credit card debt effectively while waiting for potential rate drops.

These expenditures could include infrastructure improvements like rail lines and bridges, cybersecurity enhancements, and advanced technology development.

HELOCs can be advantageous for taking advantage of falling interest rates, consolidating credit card debt, and tackling home improvements. However, they are not recommended for funding vacations or building pools, due to the risk of using your home as collateral.
