          <p>Air Canada is set to restart its flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The strike, which lasted less than 12 hours, had stranded over 100,000 travelers globally during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the workers back, citing economic risks and referring the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for arbitration. The airline anticipates a full return to normal operations will take several days, with some cancellations expected in the interim as it stabilizes its schedule.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but remains a significant threat, with maximum winds of 125 mph. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, prompting considerable flash flood warnings. Forecasters expect Erin to re-intensify after a temporary weakening cycle and turn north, steering between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. While a direct mainland landfall is not anticipated, dangerous surf and rip currents are expected along the eastern seaboard.</p>

          <p>A home gardener is raising awareness about the environmental risks posed by Dame's Rocket, a wildflower with beautiful purple blooms that is actually an invasive species. In a widely shared video, she demonstrates the necessity of removing the plants before they seed to prevent them from outcompeting and displacing native flora. This action is crucial for maintaining local biodiversity, as native plants provide essential food and habitat for pollinators like bees and butterflies. The article emphasizes that such individual efforts contribute to healthier ecosystems and inspire broader environmental consciousness.</p>

          <p>After nearly 25 years apart, an undocumented immigrant in California was emotionally reunited with his elderly parents from Zacatecas, Mexico. The reunion was made possible by a program that helps Mexican citizens secure temporary visitor visas to see family members in the U.S. from whom they have been separated by immigration status. The article captures the profound personal cost of long-term separation, detailing the family's reliance on phone calls and remittances over the decades. It highlights both the joy of the reunion and the precariousness of life for immigrant families divided by the border.</p>

          <p>This article briefly touches on the redevelopment of an ex-industrial area in Washington, D.C., located north of Massachusetts Avenue. To attract new residents and businesses, authorities rebranded the neighborhood, once known colloquially as "Swampoodle," with the trendier name "NoMa." This naming strategy was part of a broader urban renewal project in the 1990s and 2000s aimed at transforming the area near the city's main railway station. The rebranding effort sought to create an identity similar to other fashionable districts like New York's NoMad or Soho.</p>

          <p>Australia has officially granted asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activist who fled the city in 2020 while facing criminal charges related to the 2019 protests. Hui, a former lawmaker, confirmed that he and his family have been granted visas, expressing gratitude for the protection offered by the Australian government. In his statement, he reflected on the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He also urged Australia to do more to help other activists who remain jailed in Hong Kong.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal reflection, the author describes how her initial indifference to Renaissance art transformed into a profound connection as she gained more life experience. She recounts how trauma, and later pregnancy and motherhood, allowed her to see the emotional depth in works by artists like Caravaggio, Piero della Francesca, and Raphael. The essay posits that the ability to be moved by such art is tied to personal growth and an empathy that develops over time. This newfound appreciation allows for a connection not just with the art itself, but with the universal human experiences it depicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a £190 million summer spending spree on key players like Martin Zubimendi and Viktor Gyokeres, Arsenal appears poised to make its strongest challenge for the Premier League title in years. The article suggests that manager Mikel Arteta has successfully built a squad with increased depth, goal-scoring threat, and a balanced age profile, with most key players entering their peak years. The new signings have eliminated a previous drop-off in quality between starters and substitutes, raising expectations for success this season. The team has also adopted a more direct, fast-paced attacking style to break its 21-year league title drought.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured the "canal killer," responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. The detective met with suspect Bryan Patrick Miller under the pretense of a casual dinner to surreptitiously collect his DNA from a water glass. Miller, known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character, was identified as a person of interest through genetic genealogy. Eleven days after the meeting, the DNA from the glass was confirmed as a match to evidence from the crime scenes, leading to his immediate arrest and eventual conviction.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is currently hosting a major exhibition of works by 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, on loan from Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery. According to the gallery's deputy director, the exhibition is curated to specifically emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and connection to Russian culture. This framing comes as Ukraine has also claimed Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine when it was part of the Russian Empire, as part of its own national cultural heritage. The exhibition highlights the ongoing cultural and diplomatic ties between China and Russia.</p>
