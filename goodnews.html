        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies within the next decade to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort focused on predicting and preventing illnesses, which includes a ¬£650 million investment in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that this gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows an earlier announcement of a study analyzing the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies, marking a significant step towards personalized and preventative healthcare. The NHS hopes that such measures will allow for earlier interventions and improved health outcomes for the population.</p>
