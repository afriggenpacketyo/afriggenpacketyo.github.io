          <p>Emmet Sheehan made a strong return to the Dodgers after recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitching four innings and allowing only one run. Justin Wrobleski followed with five innings of relief, but the Padres rallied to tie the game in the ninth after a throwing error. Will Smith then hit a walk-off home run to secure the Dodgers' 4-3 victory, overshadowing the bullpen's fatigue after consecutive bullpen games. Sheehan's performance offers an intriguing option for the Dodgers' shorthanded rotation in the second half of the season, highlighting his improved strength and understanding of the game.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster to reveal stunning frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in London. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the wealth of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art also shows a blend of classical ideas with local influences, such as the inclusion of mistletoe, and the team hopes to find the missing fragment containing the artist's name. The discovery highlights the early commitment and investment the Romans made in London, viewing it as more than just a provincial outpost.</p>

          <p>With increasing tariffs, businesses are employing "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials or dimensions to fit into more favorable harmonized system codes. This legal practice involves strategic design choices that result in different tariff classifications and duty rates. Companies in sectors like consumer goods and garments are finding it relatively easy to implement these strategies, while more regulated sectors face greater challenges. The article provides examples of companies tweaking products to qualify for lower tariffs, emphasizing the need to balance redesign with honest product representation.</p>
