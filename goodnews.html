          <h2>Bank of England Cuts Interest Rates Amid Global Economic Uncertainty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 09:59:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England has reduced interest rates to 4.25%, marking the fourth cut in the past year, driven by a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey cited concerns about the unpredictable global economy, particularly US tariffs, while acknowledging the potential impact of a UK-US trade deal. The decision was not unanimous, with the rate-setting committee divided between a larger cut and no change, reflecting concerns about the global trade war's potential hit to economic growth being offset by lower energy bills and inflation. This move aims to balance controlling inflation with supporting economic growth, as the UK anticipates stronger growth in the first quarter, influenced by US firms stockpiling goods before tariffs take effect.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, addressing concerns about their safety and potential. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA to create proteins within our cells, with mRNA vaccines using strands of mRNA to code for viral proteins, triggering an immune response without altering a person's DNA. The article emphasizes that mRNA vaccines have been studied for decades and are now being explored for various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Despite some lawmakers pushing to ban them and the government cutting funding, scientists maintain that mRNA therapies hold great potential.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party secured enough seats in the House of Commons to form a government in Canada, falling short of a majority. Key figures like Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost their seats. The Liberals won 169 seats, while the Conservatives have 143 seats. Both parties saw a rise in their share of the national vote, mostly at the expense of smaller parties, with the NDP seeing a large drop in its share of the popular vote.</p>
