          <p>A Democratic National Committee panel has recommended redoing the elections of David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta as party vice-chairs due to alleged violations of the party's charter during the February vote. Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg, challenged the election, claiming the DNC improperly combined questions, giving male candidates an advantage. Hogg contends the move is politically motivated due to his efforts to reform the party, particularly his push to primary some Democratic politicians. The article highlights the internal divisions within the DNC regarding Hogg's leadership and reform efforts.</p>

          <p>To foster lasting trust and align security interests, China needs to demonstrate openness, consistency, and a commitment to multilateral dialogue with ASEAN countries. Cambodia's recent decision to allow warships from multiple nations, including Vietnam, Russia, and Japan, to access its Ream naval base signals an effort to dispel the notion that it is solely a Chinese outpost. This move aligns with China's stated vision of an inclusive regional security framework, emphasizing peaceful resolution of disputes, particularly in the South China Sea, by directly concerned sovereign states, as articulated in Beijing's Global Security Initiative.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by the oil and gas sector, as well as tech and finance industries, according to a World Bank report. While the World Bank projects continued growth, it also warns of slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs. President Bola Tinubu's government has implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but these reforms have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with high poverty and inflation rates remaining concerns.</p>

          <p>A museum dedicated to the Holocaust and the history of Jews has opened in Brnƒõnec, Czech Republic, at the site where Oskar Schindler saved 1,200 Jews during World War II. The museum is housed in a renovated spinning mill and displays the history of Schindler, his wife Emilie, and the L√∂w-Beer family, along with testimonies of Holocaust survivors. The project was driven by Daniel L√∂w-Beer, whose predecessors owned the factory before it was stolen by the Nazis.</p>

          <p>Scientists are in a race to discover why the Universe exists, with teams in the US and Japan building detectors to study neutrinos. The US-based Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese Hyper K project are both aiming to find answers by studying the differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos. The scientists hope to understand why matter and antimatter didn't cancel each other out after the Big Bang.</p>
