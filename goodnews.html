          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order approving a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a nationwide ban. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture, with American investors like Oracle holding a majority stake, and limits Chinese parent company ByteDance's ownership to less than 20%. Under the deal, Oracle will host American user data and review the app's code for security, while TikTok's recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained solely on U.S. user data. The order extends the enforcement pause on the divest-or-ban law to January 2026 to allow the agreement to be finalized.</p>

For Android users, the Samsung Health app provides similar functionality, allowing users to add medication details, set schedules, and receive refill reminders. The article also recommends third-party apps like MediSafe and MyTherapy for those seeking more specialized tools, and suggests smart pill dispensers as a hands-off solution to prevent missed doses, particularly for older adults.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang delivered a speech at the United Nations calling for a renewed commitment to multilateralism and a stable global order, while implicitly criticizing the United States' isolationist policies. Without naming President Trump, Li warned against a "Law of the Jungle" approach where might dictates right, stating that such a path risks global division and regression. He urged nations to collaborate more closely to find common interests and promote inclusive economic globalization. Drawing on the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, the premier emphasized the peace and prosperity that have resulted from adherence to global rules and collective action.</p>

          <p>China's stock markets are experiencing a significant rally in 2025, drawing substantial interest from both domestic and foreign investors. The Shanghai Composite reached a decade high, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is up 30%, driven by government signals to support economic growth and the market. With limited alternative investment options due to a slump in the property sector, Chinese retail investors are re-entering the market, boosting sentiment further. This renewed confidence has also attracted foreign capital, with Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management recently reopening positions in Alibaba for the first time in four years.

          <p>OpenAI has unveiled a series of massive partnerships aimed at building the infrastructure required for the next generation of artificial intelligence, with commitments potentially reaching trillions of dollars. The company announced a deal with Nvidia for up to $100 billion to build data center capacity, and an expanded $400 billion "Stargate" project with Oracle and SoftBank.

          <p>President Trump traveled to Bethpage Black on Long Island, New York, to attend the first day of the 45th Ryder Cup, a prestigious biennial golf tournament between the United States and Europe. The president stated he was there to "represent the United States," and his presence was welcomed by top American player Scottie Scheffler, who said it would provide a boost to the U.S. team. An avid golfer and owner of several courses, Trump has been actively involved in the sport, including hosting LIV Golf events and participating in merger negotiations between LIV and the PGA Tour. The U.S. team entered as favorites but fell behind in the early matches.</p>

          <p>The Brooklyn-based rock band Geese has released a new album, "Getting Killed," which showcases an intense and unpredictable blend of punk, free jazz, and other eclectic influences. The album is characterized by its raw energy, complex time signatures, and the distinctive vocal style of frontman Cameron Winter, which has drawn comparisons to Radiohead's Thom Yorke. The article praises the band for moving the rock genre forward with music that reflects the disorienting nature of modern life, fighting the colonization of the mind by digital content. While noting some areas for refinement, the review concludes that Geese has achieved something rare by suggesting an exciting future for rock music.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull discovered in China suggests that the human lineage may have diverged from ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than previously believed. The study, published in the journal Science, found that the skull, known as Yunxian 2, exhibits a mix of traits from both the early human forerunner Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that early humans dispersed primarily from Africa, suggesting East Asia played a more significant role in hominin evolution. While some experts find the research provocative, others caution that more evidence is needed to confirm these potentially transformative conclusions.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has seized more than $220 million worth of cocaine in a series of recent drug interdictions in the Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Cutter Midgett intercepted four alleged smuggling vessels off the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America, seizing over 21,000 pounds of cocaine. In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized another 8,700 pounds of cocaine from a boat north of Panama.

          <p>The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation, held steady at an annual rate of 2.9% in August, aligning with economists' expectations. The headline inflation rate saw a slight increase to 2.7%, while personal income and spending both rose more than anticipated. These figures suggest that President Trump's tariffs have had a limited impact on consumer prices so far. The stable inflation reading is unlikely to alter the central bank's current trajectory, with policymakers still anticipating two more interest rate reductions before the end of the year.

The festival, which originated in 1818 as a harvest celebration, features large beer tents, fairground rides, parades, and traditional Swabian food. Organizers hope to match last year's attendance of 4.6 million, though they acknowledge that Germany's current economic conditions could impact consumer spending at the event.</p>

          <p>Shares of Paccar, the parent company of truck manufacturers Peterbilt and Kenworth, rose by approximately 5% following President Trump's announcement of a new 25% tariff on imported heavy trucks. The tariff, effective October 1, is intended to protect domestic manufacturers from what the administration calls unfair foreign competition. According to a Bank of America analysis, Paccar's domestically produced trucks cost more than those made by competitors in Mexico. The new tariff is expected to address this price disparity, placing Paccar in a more advantageous market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>HSBC has announced a "world-first" trial where it successfully used quantum computing to optimize its algorithmic bond trading processes. In collaboration with IBM, the bank combined classical computing with IBM's Heron quantum processor, resulting in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of bond price predictions. This enhancement allows traders to better estimate the likelihood of a trade being filled at a quoted price, which can lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The trial provides the first empirical evidence that quantum computers can solve practical, complex problems in finance, signaling a new frontier for the industry.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed a terrorism charge against Liam Og O hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. The charge stemmed from an incident where O hAnnaidh, who performs as Mo Chara, waved a Hezbollah flag during a London concert in 2024; Hezbollah is a proscribed terrorist organization in Britain. The chief magistrate ruled that prosecutors had missed the deadline to bring the charge by one day, rendering the proceedings unlawful.
