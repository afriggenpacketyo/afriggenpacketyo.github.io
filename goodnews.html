          <p>Productivity software company Notion has surpassed $500 million in annualized revenue, largely driven by the successful integration of artificial intelligence features. The company, which introduced its AI assistant before the public launch of ChatGPT, is now launching a customizable agent to further meet enterprise demand from clients like Nvidia and Volvo. Despite its growth and having over 100 million users, Notion faces significant competition from tech giants like Microsoft, which has launched a similar product called Loop.

          <p>During a joint press conference, President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer addressed several key global issues, revealing areas of both agreement and divergence. Trump criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin for the war in Ukraine but also indicated he is seeking to retake control of Bagram airbase in Afghanistan due to its proximity to China's nuclear facilities. While the leaders disagreed on the UK's impending recognition of Palestinian statehood, Starmer's firm stance against Hamas earned praise from Trump. The discussion also touched upon UK defense spending, online safety, and US trade tariffs.</p>

          <p>During a press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump hinted at forthcoming "good news" regarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, suggesting a ceasefire could be near. Trump expressed a sense of obligation to resolve the conflict, which has caused millions of deaths, but also voiced his disappointment with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, "He's let me down." Despite campaigning on his ability to end the war in a day, Trump admitted the negotiations have been more difficult than anticipated. The remarks came at the conclusion of his successful three-day state visit to the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>A wave of youth-led protests across Asia, in countries like Nepal, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, has successfully challenged established governments, leading to resignations and policy reversals. These Gen Z-driven movements, fueled by digital connectivity and anger over corruption and economic inequality, have drawn comparisons to the Arab Spring. While some nations, like Sri Lanka, have achieved a degree of stability post-protest, others face uncertain futures. Experts note that while social media has been a powerful tool for mobilization, the long-term success of these movements will depend on their ability to institutionalize their demands for reform.</p>

          <p>In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, a team of eight female athletes is preserving Mexican culture through the traditional equestrian sport of escaramuza. This synchronized performance involves riders in traditional 'adelitas' dresses executing precise maneuvers on horseback while riding sidesaddle. The sport traces its roots to the women who assisted soldiers during the Mexican Revolution, and it requires a deep bond between rider and horse, as well as extensive training and balance. For participants like Flor Arroyo and Jannely Villa, escaramuza is a powerful connection to their heritage and a way to ensure their cultural traditions are passed down.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented its first interest rate cut since December, reducing its benchmark rate by a quarter-point to a range between 4% and 4.25%. This move is expected to have varied effects on consumers, with immediate relief likely for those with home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and a preemptive decline already seen in mortgage rates. However, the impact on high-interest credit card debt will be minimal, and savers may see reduced returns on high-yield savings accounts. Officials anticipate further rate cuts, potentially offering more significant relief for borrowers over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision has sparked a debate within Ukrainian society, with some supporting the move and others viewing it as unfair to active soldiers.

          <p>A new paper in Nature Food proposes that the extreme suffering of chickens bred for rapid growth can be prevented for just pennies per hour of pain averted. Researchers at the Welfare Footprint Institute calculated that switching to slower-growing chicken breeds could eliminate about 33 hours of disabling pain per bird at a cost of around 45 cents per pound for producers. While this change would slightly increase consumer prices and may have a marginal environmental impact, the authors argue the immense animal welfare benefits are substantial. The study aims to introduce a "welfare footprint" metric into food policy discussions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut is lowering costs for conventional mortgages, its impact on reverse mortgages is more complex. Reverse mortgage rates are influenced by a broader range of factors than just Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite. However, lower rates can still benefit retirees by increasing their total borrowing capacity, as the formula used to calculate accessible equity is rate-sensitive. Retirees considering this option should compare quotes from multiple lenders and carefully choose between fixed-rate products for predictability and adjustable-rate options to potentially capture further rate declines.
