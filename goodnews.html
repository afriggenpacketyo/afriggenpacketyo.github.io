          <p>A 550-pound British bomb from World War II was discovered near a bridge in Dresden, Germany, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from the city center. Authorities established a 1,000-meter exclusion zone and began defusing operations once the area was cleared. Such discoveries are a regular occurrence in major German cities, a lasting legacy of Allied bombing campaigns during the war. This event highlights the ongoing efforts to manage unexploded ordnance and ensure public safety decades after the conflict ended.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney's fiscal third-quarter earnings exceeded analyst expectations, largely due to the continued growth of its streaming services and increased consumer spending at its theme parks. The direct-to-consumer segment saw a significant rise in revenue and subscribers for Disney+ and Hulu. However, these gains were partially offset by a decline in the traditional linear TV business, which faced lower advertising revenue and viewership. The company's experiences segment, including parks and cruises, reported robust growth, indicating strong consumer demand for in-person entertainment.</p>

          <p>McDonald's announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, signaling a significant turnaround in its U.S. market. The fast-food giant's domestic same-store sales grew by 2.5%, reversing previous declines, a success attributed to popular promotions like a meal tie-in with the "Minecraft" movie. International markets also showed strong performance, with notable sales growth in the UK, Australia, and China.

          <p>Recently released FBI data for 2024 indicates a significant nationwide decrease in crime, challenging the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave often used in political rhetoric. The annual report shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime, with murders falling by 14.5% to levels not seen since the 1960s. Incidents of reported sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault also declined. These figures, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, suggest that crime rates were at historic lows during the final full year of the previous administration, directly contradicting claims made during the election campaign.</p>

          <p>Drugmaker Novo Nordisk reported a 67% year-over-year increase in sales for its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy, though the figure fell slightly below analyst expectations. The company is navigating a complex U.S. market, facing demands from the Trump administration for lower drug prices and competition from cheaper compounded versions of its treatments. In response, Novo Nordisk is emphasizing its direct-to-consumer sales channel, which offers the drug at a lower cash price. The company reiterated its full-year outlook while acknowledging that the prevalence of compounded drugs remains the largest factor impacting its U.S. market share.</p>

          <p>UK Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated that football clubs in crisis, such as Sheffield Wednesday and Morecambe, can "absolutely" be saved from collapse. Both clubs are facing severe financial issues, including delayed wage payments and embargoes. Nandy emphasized that a new independent football regulator, set to launch later this year, will have the power to intervene, including forcing owners to sell in dire circumstances. She highlighted the importance of these clubs to their communities and cited the need for stronger ownership tests to prevent such situations, referencing the 2019 collapse of Bury FC as a catalyst for the new legislation.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate, China has announced it will waive tuition for the final year of public kindergarten, starting this autumn. The policy, which also includes subsidies for private kindergartens, is part of a broader government strategy to lower the financial burden of raising children and encourage more births. The move aims to alleviate pressure on families who are already struggling with a weak economy and a real estate slump. The central and local governments will share the cost of subsidizing the schools to offset their loss of tuition revenue.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, some residents frustrated with the city's slow response to safety requests have begun painting their own crosswalks at dangerous intersections. One such DIY project near Stoner Park in Sawtelle was initially removed by the city, sparking a community outcry. In response, the city reversed course and announced it would officially install the crosswalks. This phenomenon highlights a broader tension between community-led safety initiatives and bureaucratic processes. Advocacy groups see these actions as a direct reaction to the city's failure to address its high rate of pedestrian-related traffic incidents.</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California system must reconsider its policy that prohibits hiring students without legal documentation for on-campus jobs. The court found that the UC's justification for the policy—fear of potential federal litigation—was insufficient and that the practice is discriminatory under state law. While the ruling does not force the university to immediately overturn the policy, it requires a re-evaluation based on proper legal criteria. This decision is a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argue the policy denies students crucial financial and career-advancing opportunities.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee discusses his new film, "Highest 2 Lowest," a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa's 1963 thriller "High and Low" and his fifth collaboration with actor Denzel Washington. Lee explains that the New York-set film explores deep moral questions, forcing the audience to consider what they would do in a high-stakes kidnapping scenario. Despite an 18-year gap since their last project, Lee says the chemistry with Washington was immediate, highlighting the actor's improvisational genius. The film also emphasizes the importance of a strong, loving Black family, a theme Lee says is central to both his and Washington's values.</p>
