          <p>An American woman living in Milan shares her experiences renting a 1,227-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment for $1,850 a month, detailing the renovations she and her husband undertook. Despite the common hesitation in the United States regarding renovations to rental properties, the Italian government offers tax incentives for home improvements, even for renters. The couple was able to save roughly $33,400 between government rebates and a rent pause from their landlord, while making their apartment feel more current and more like them. The article emphasizes the importance of leisure time in Italy, highlighting the tradition of aperitivo and family-friendly activities.</p>

          <p>UK strawberry growers are reporting a "stonking start" to the season, with warmer days and cooler nights resulting in sweeter fruit. The dry spring has contributed to a good crop, and growers are noticing a combination of good size and marked sweetness. While some farmers express the need for rain, irrigation systems are in place to mitigate the effects of extreme weather. Consumers can look forward to a summer filled with flavorful strawberries, and are encouraged to experiment with pairings like black pepper, balsamic vinegar, or chilli to enhance the fruit's natural sweetness.</p>

The European relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, believes that an agreement to reduce border queues would be a sensible objective, though it may require the UK to align with certain EU standards. Concerns have been raised that this could lead to the UK becoming a "rule taker," but the government insists on maintaining control over migration and assessing contributions to EU projects on a case-by-case basis.</p>

          <p>Boeing's new 777X aircraft will not feature engine chevrons, which are typically used to reduce jet engine noise. This is due to advancements in engine design, specifically the General Electric GE9X engines, which incorporate new nozzle designs and ceramic matrix composite materials for heat resistance. These innovations enable a more compact exhaust stream, reducing friction and vortices without compromising engine thrust. The GE9X engine also utilizes a honeycomb architecture for acoustic disruption, further minimizing noise pollution.</p>

          <p>A CDC study indicates a significant decrease in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant women and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalizations for babies under seven months old have decreased by as much as 56%, and by as much as 71% in newborns. Experts attribute this decline to the effectiveness of the new preventative measures, and suggest that increased uptake could lead to even greater reductions in RSV hospitalizations in the future.</p>
