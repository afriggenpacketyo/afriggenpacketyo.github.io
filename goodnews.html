          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address hundreds of senior U.S. military officers at a rare gathering at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. According to officials, Hegseth will personally deliver his message about restoring the "warrior ethos" to the U.S. military and present new standards to achieve this goal. The unusual meeting has raised questions regarding security needs and travel costs, as it summons a significant number of high-ranking officers from around the world for what might be a brief address. The Pentagon plans to record the meeting for future public distribution.</p>

          <p>Team Europe established a significant early lead on the first day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black, winning the first three matches in a historic start on American soil. Despite a partial recovery from Team USA in the afternoon sessions, which included a dominant win by Cameron Young and Justin Thomas, Europe ended the day with a 5.5 to 2.5 point advantage. European players Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood were standout performers, both going undefeated, while top American players like Scottie Scheffler struggled.

          <p>An AI-powered, interactive holographic-style avatar of the late Stan Lee is being featured at the Los Angeles Comic Con, allowing fans to ask questions and engage with the comic book legend's persona. The "Stan Lee Experience" uses a large language model fed with decades of Lee's interviews, writings, and public appearances to generate responses within specific "guardrails" to keep the conversation focused on his universe. The technology, developed by Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, is seen as an entry point into Lee's storytelling legacy. Organizers hope it will help maintain and expand his legacy for new generations of fans.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, investors should closely monitor next week's nonfarm payroll report, as it will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates. A strong jobs number could deter the Fed from implementing another rate cut. Key corporate earnings are also on the docket, including reports from cruise operator Carnival, payroll processor Paychex, and athletic apparel giant Nike. Cramer suggests that Paychex's performance will serve as a reliable indicator of the broader economy's health, while Nike's report is considered particularly significant for the consumer sector.

          <p>Wag Hotels, a pet boarding and daycare chain, has agreed to a $150,000 settlement in a consumer protection lawsuit brought by several California district attorney's offices. The lawsuit alleged that the company neglected animals and failed to report dog bites as required by law. These allegations followed a media investigation that revealed claims of understaffing, inexperienced employees, and improper care of pets. While Wag Hotels admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement, the Santa Clara County District Attorney emphasized the importance of holding caretakers to high standards when entrusted with pets, which are considered family members.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares its 15th five-year plan, which outlines the nation's socio-economic development strategy, the role of Hong Kong is being closely examined. Analysts suggest the city could play a crucial and unique part as a "superconnector" between mainland China and global markets, especially as its economy shows signs of recovery. Hong Kong's position within this national blueprint will likely determine the level of policy support and resources it receives from the central government. The plan will be a key indicator of how Beijing intends to leverage the city's financial and business strengths in its broader economic strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The article suggests this gathering could create an opening for a U.S.-North Korea summit, potentially mediated by China and South Korea, echoing diplomatic maneuvers from 2018-2019. With rising tensions on the Korean peninsula, the forum offers a valuable opportunity for dialogue and consensus-building among key regional players.
