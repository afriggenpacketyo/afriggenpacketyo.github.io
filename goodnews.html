        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal has officially completed the signing of 21-year-old defender Cristhian Mosquera from the Spanish club Valencia. The transfer involves an initial fee of approximately £13 million, and Mosquera has signed a five-year contract with an option for an additional year. A versatile player capable of performing as a centre-back or right-back, he is expected to fill the squad position left by Takehiro Tomiyasu. Mosquera was a regular starter for Valencia last season and will join his new team for their pre-season tour.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that despite a recent dip in approval ratings, President Trump has achieved significant policy victories that will have lasting positive effects. The author cites accomplishments such as securing the southern border, passing major tax cuts, striking Iran's nuclear facilities, and implementing tariffs. The piece argues that these bold actions required expending political capital, causing short-term dissatisfaction among some voters. The author believes the long-term benefits of these policies will ultimately vindicate the president's strategy and improve his standing.</p>

He expressed that the market's negative reaction was unwarranted given their strong performance metrics. The segment also noted that Alphabet's increased capital expenditure outlook is a positive sign for semiconductor companies like Broadcom and Nvidia, which are also held in Cramer's charitable trust. The article concludes by listing other stocks discussed during the show. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant jump, becoming the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge appears to be driven by retail investors on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, who targeted the stock due to its high short interest. A new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney also generated buzz for the brand. This phenomenon follows similar volatile trading patterns seen recently with other companies like GoPro and Krispy Kreme, fueled by coordinated individual investor activity.</p>

          <p>Two wallabies that escaped from a private enclosure in Mouscron, Belgium, prompted a multi-day, cross-border pursuit involving police and firefighters. One of the marsupials was safely captured in a residential garden in northern France after several days on the loose. The second wallaby, however, remains at large, and authorities are relying on public sightings to locate it. The owner of the animals was on vacation when they escaped, and footage of the creatures hopping through urban areas has since gone viral on social media.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, has launched a new political party alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana. The yet-unnamed party aims to "take on the rich and powerful" and offer a grassroots, community-led alternative to what they describe as Labour's top-down control and the divisive politics of Reform UK. The new venture will campaign on a platform to the left of Labour, focusing on issues like wealth redistribution and anti-war efforts, and seeks to capitalize on energy from the left of British politics.</p>

          <p>Three British nationals arrested for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have avoided a potential death sentence. The drugs were reportedly disguised in packets of Angel Delight, a powdered dessert mix. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were instead given a 12-month sentence by a judge. Considering time already served, they could be released by early 2026. While Indonesia has severe penalties for drug trafficking, it has maintained a temporary moratorium on executions since 2017.</p>
