          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he intends to use as Air Force One. The administration plans to retrofit the plane for presidential use, and it will eventually be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation. This move comes as the modernization of two existing Boeing 747s for Air Force One faces significant delays and cost overruns. The new commercial Boeing 747-800 costs roughly $400 million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is increasingly concerned about societal polarization, particularly regarding the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The German domestic intelligence service has classified the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist," but the party is challenging this in court. There is a debate on whether to ban the AfD, with opponents arguing it would further divide society, while supporters insist that enemies of democracy should not be in a position to destroy it. The media's coverage of the AfD is also under scrutiny, with calls for journalists to clearly label the party as outside the democratic spectrum.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in decision-making, particularly in creative fields like television. Diller argues that while data can inform, it cannot predict the public's appetite or replace simple human instinct. He shares anecdotes from his time at ABC, including the development of "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker," to illustrate the power of trusting one's gut feeling.</p>
