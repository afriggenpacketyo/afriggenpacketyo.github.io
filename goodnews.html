          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, would add veteran leadership and playmaking to a roster that already includes James Harden and Bradley Beal. Frank emphasized the team's desire to enhance its ballhandling and noted that any player joining would understand they would likely be in a reserve role. The potential signing reflects the Clippers' strategy to build depth for a championship run.</p>

          <p>After years of growth, the popularity of learning Mandarin is waning in many Western countries, including the United States, New Zealand, and Britain. University enrollments for Mandarin in the U.S. have dropped significantly from their peak in 2013, with similar downward trends seen in secondary schools in New Zealand and universities in the UK. While the language's growth continues modestly in some European nations, it is no longer widely seen as the essential "language of the future" it was once hailed as, reflecting a broader shift in geopolitical and cultural focus.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is driven by the dual pressures of the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has suggested that the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK could supplement, or if necessary, replace the US security guarantee for Europe. The move signals a recognition that European nations must take on greater responsibility for their own defense.</p>

The Lions dominated the first 50 minutes, building a substantial lead that made the outcome feel inevitable and subdued the atmosphere. While Australia scored two late tries after the Lions made substitutions, their comeback was too late to threaten the result. Analysts suggest the Wallabies appeared underprepared, and the Lions have more potential to unlock, raising questions about the competitiveness of the remainder of the series.</p>
