        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) Commission has announced a new strategy that includes lifting the long-standing restrictions on whole milk in schools. This move is part of a broader plan with over 120 initiatives aimed at combating childhood chronic diseases, which also addresses issues like toxic food dyes and misleading health advertisements. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated the goal is to realign the nation's food and health systems based on scientific evidence rather than special interests. The policy shift would require updates to national dietary guidelines and USDA school nutrition standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metro bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership. The transformation, spearheaded by CEO Dawn Distler, focused on directly addressing passenger needs by redesigning routes for better frequency, including 15-minute service on key lines, and expanding to seven-day-a-week operation. This was achieved without a budget increase, partly by hiring drivers based on customer service skills. The success highlights the impact of prioritizing passenger feedback in public transportation planning and operations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed plans that could remove the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. The change would allow individual banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move aims to reduce "payment friction" for larger purchases like grocery shopping, it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that card providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would be expected to implement robust security measures for high-value transactions.</p>

          <p>Voters in Northern Virginia's 11th congressional district are participating in a special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly. The race pits Democrat James Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to Connolly, against Republican Stewart Whitson. The district is heavily Democratic, and a victory for Walkinshaw would narrow the Republican majority in the House to 219-213. A key issue in the election has been President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, as the district has one of the highest concentrations of federal employees in the country.</p>

          <p>China's largest government-backed research fund is now accepting applications for the study of stablecoins, signaling Beijing's increasing focus on the digital asset class. The National Natural Science Foundation of China will provide grants for research into global stablecoins and the development of cross-border monitoring systems. This move indicates a cautious yet strategic interest, as the country has previously banned decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin over financial stability concerns. The research aims to provide policy suggestions for how China can manage the challenges and opportunities presented by the growing global stablecoin market.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Suggests Companies with Aggressive Stock Buybacks Are Outperforming</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 18:56:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, citing analysis from Goldman Sachs, companies that are aggressively repurchasing their own shares are being rewarded by investors, even as the overall pace of buybacks slows. These companies, dubbed "buyback aristocrats," have consistently reduced their share counts over the past decade and tend to perform well, particularly when the economy is slowing. Cramer highlighted Apple and Wells Fargo as examples where significant buybacks signal management's confidence in their companies' futures. This strategy is seen as a way to reduce the supply of stock and support share prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum to increase enforcement of transparency and accuracy laws for direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertisements, with a particular focus on social media and digital platforms. The administration plans to send hundreds of cease-and-desist and warning letters to companies, online pharmacies, and social media influencers who fail to properly disclose risks and side effects. The action aims to use existing regulations to ensure patients receive balanced information, rather than creating new rules or an outright ban. This move follows criticism of the industry's advertising practices from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

          <p>England delivered a commanding performance in their World Cup qualifier, defeating Serbia 5-0 in a decisive away match in Belgrade. The victory, described as the best of manager Thomas Tuchel's tenure, saw goals from Harry Kane, Noni Madueke, Ezri Konsa, and Marc Guehi. The team displayed strong attacking flair and defensive solidity, silencing the typically hostile home crowd from the start. The win solidifies England's position for World Cup qualification and provides Tuchel with positive selection dilemmas, as several younger players excelled in the absence of established starters like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.</p>

          <p>Shares of Oracle soared 27% in after-hours trading after the company projected massive future growth in its cloud infrastructure business, driven by major AI-related contracts. This optimistic forecast overshadowed the company's quarterly earnings and revenue, which narrowly missed analyst expectations. Oracle reported its remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted revenue, have skyrocketed to $455 billion, bolstered by deals with companies like OpenAI. The company now anticipates its cloud infrastructure revenue will reach $18 billion in fiscal year 2026, signaling its aggressive push to compete with larger cloud providers.

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated their populations. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia is a major killer of koalas, causing blindness, infertility, and death, with infection rates reaching as high as 70% in some colonies. With this approval, researchers hope to secure funding for a large-scale rollout to wildlife hospitals and wild populations, offering new hope for the iconic species' survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that reportedly runs up to 100 times faster on certain tasks than conventional systems. The model mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons, allowing it to learn from significantly less training data while maintaining high speed. Notably, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, rather than relying on dominant Nvidia hardware. This development is strategically important for China's goal of achieving AI self-sufficiency amid U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor technology.</p>
