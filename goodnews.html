          <h2>Federal Reserve Officials Express Concerns Over Tariffs and Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 14:47:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting revealed concerns among officials regarding the labor market, inflation, and the potential impact of tariffs. While most agreed it was premature to lower interest rates, some governors dissented, advocating for a rate cut. Policymakers acknowledged risks to both inflation and employment, with varying opinions on which posed the greater threat. President Trump's tariffs were a key point of discussion, with uncertainty surrounding their effects on inflation and the labor market. The meeting highlighted the difficult tradeoffs the committee might face if inflation remained high while the labor market weakened. Decisions on rates would hinge on each variable's distance from the Committee's goal and the anticipated timeframes for closing those gaps. Optimism surrounding the economy is mixed due to these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

Democratic members faced police escorts to ensure their presence, leading to protests. The House and Senate committees have both passed the redistricting bill, with further votes expected.

Filings with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics revealed 690 transactions, including purchases of bonds from T-Mobile U.S., United Health, Home Depot, and Meta. Companies, governments, and other groups issue bonds to raise capital for various purposes, with investors receiving interest payments. Some of the companies whose debt is now owned by Trump have been directly affected by his policies or business dealings.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of GCSE results day, students and parents are debating whether rewards or financial incentives can motivate teens to achieve better grades. Some parents offer cash or gifts for top grades, while others focus on praising effort and involvement throughout the school year. Experts suggest that rewarding effort is a more sustainable strategy than focusing solely on grades. They also caution that cash rewards can make achievements feel transactional and create tension among friendship groups. The article suggests that intrinsic motivation and parental support are more effective in the long term. The results of this approach may be positive.</p>

The city must also provide $60,000 in grant funding to a non-profit for homeless services. The settlement aims to address the homelessness crisis in the city.</p>
