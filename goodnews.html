          <p>The Canadian government has withdrawn its planned digital services tax on U.S. technology firms, prompting the resumption of trade talks with the United States. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations over the tax, which he had called a blatant attack. The 3% levy would have affected companies like Google and Amazon and was a major point of contention. Prime Minister Mark Carney's office confirmed that negotiations will now continue toward a new economic and security relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase TikTok, with their identities to be revealed soon. This development follows the 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations due to national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline, indicated that any deal would likely need approval from Beijing. The fate of the popular social media platform in the U.S. remains uncertain pending a potential sale.</p>

The fitness of key players like Lauren James remains a central question, as does the relative inexperience in the goalkeeping position.

However, British farmers have criticized the agreement, arguing that agriculture was used as a bargaining chip, particularly with concessions made on U.S. beef and ethanol imports.

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, and recent studies are exploring the cause. Research from Chinese universities suggests that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a key factor. This system creates a low-frequency deceleration that can provoke queasiness in passengers. The findings highlight an unexpected challenge in the transition to new energy vehicles, affecting passenger comfort and health.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, has voiced concerns that the expanded Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to fixture congestion. The tournament, held in the United States, leaves little recovery time for players and gives a significant advantage to rival teams not participating. Guardiola acknowledged the arguments made by other managers about the relentless schedule but noted that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by football's governing bodies. City is set to face Al-Hilal in the tournament's last 16.</p>
