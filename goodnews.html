          <p>Google Cloud experienced significant global outages on Thursday, leading to disruptions for various internet services including OpenAI and Shopify. The outages, which began in the late morning Pacific Time, affected multiple Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Shopify reported being aware of the issue impacting several services, while OpenAI noted problems related to single sign-on and other login methods. Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud's leader, announced later that all services were restored and expressed regret for the disruption caused to customers. Optimism score of 60.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the United States has continued to rise, reaching nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This increase is attributed to various factors, including changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising costs of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped significantly since 2016. Experts suggest this decline could be due to adolescents delaying sexual activity or increased contraceptive use. Optimism score of 75.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure to Meta as part of a $14.3 billion deal, where Meta will acquire a 49% stake in the AI startup without voting power. Jason Droege, the current chief strategy officer, will succeed Wang as CEO of Scale AI. This move reflects Meta's commitment to bolstering its AI efforts, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg prioritizing AI development amid competition from OpenAI and Google-parent Alphabet. Despite the acquisition, Scale AI assures that Meta's investment and Wang's transition will not impact its existing customer relationships or data privacy. Optimism score of 70.</p>

          <p>The FIFA Club World Cup is underway in the U.S., featuring 32 teams competing for a substantial $1 billion prize pool. This revamped version of the tournament has faced criticism from players concerned about an already packed schedule and sluggish ticket sales. Despite the controversies, the tournament offers a significant financial incentive for participating teams, with the winner potentially earning up to $125 million. The event marks FIFA's attempt to create a more global club tournament and provides the U.S. with an opportunity to host a major soccer event before co-hosting the World Cup in 2026.

          <p>The European Union finds itself on the sidelines as the United States and China engage in high-stakes trade talks aimed at stabilizing the global trading system. Despite hosting two rounds of these talks on European soil, the EU has been largely relegated to observing the negotiations' impact on its own trade relationships. European officials are closely monitoring the situation, recognizing that the EU's economic fortunes are increasingly tied to the decisions made by Beijing and Washington. One expert described the EU's position as being "victims of two elephants trampling on global trade," highlighting the vulnerability of the continent's economy to the actions of the two superpowers.

          <p>North Korea announced the successful repair and relaunch of a 5,000-ton destroyer that was damaged in a failed launch attempt last month. Leader Kim Jong Un attended a ceremony at the Rajin shipyard to mark the achievement, revealing plans to build two more destroyers of the same type annually. During the May 21 incident, the destroyer tipped over, causing damage, but Kim ordered its repair before a ruling party meeting. The newly launched warship is scheduled to be handed over to the navy around mid-2026. Optimism score of 65.</p>
