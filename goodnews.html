          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has commented on the career of forward Marcus Rashford, who is currently on loan at Barcelona from Manchester United. Tuchel stated that while Rashford has "no limits" to his potential, he warned the 27-year-old to avoid future regrets by consistently performing at the highest level for both his club and country. Rashford has had a promising start in Spain, but his career has been at a crossroads after falling out of favor at Manchester United. The manager emphasized that reaching one's personal best regularly is the key challenge for a player with his level of talent.</p>

          <p>A major step toward ending the two-year war in Gaza was achieved with a significant hostage and prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas. As part of a U.S.-brokered plan, the remaining living Israeli hostages were returned, while Israel released nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, leading to emotional reunions on both sides. U.S. President Donald Trump, addressing Israel's parliament, hailed the moment as a "historic dawn" for the Middle East before attending a peace summit in Egypt. While the initial phase is complete, significant challenges remain for the plan's later stages.</p>

          <p>The U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is being framed as a significant diplomatic achievement for President Donald Trump, who celebrated the deal at a summit of world leaders in Egypt. This accomplishment has garnered widespread praise and marks a potential turning point after two years of devastating conflict. However, this analysis notes that while the initial phase of hostage and prisoner exchanges is complete, the long-term success of the peace plan is not guaranteed. Future phases, including the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza, present formidable challenges that will require sustained diplomatic pressure to overcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the unique development of cumbia music in Ecuador, which began in the late 1960s by blending traditional Andean sounds with Colombian tropical rhythms. Pioneers like Polibio Mayorga created a new musical identity by "tropicalizing" the often-stigmatized music of the Ecuadorian highlands. Later, orchestra leaders such as Medardo Luzuriaga popularized the genre nationwide, creating a lasting cultural legacy. The genre continues to evolve with forms like tecnocumbia, performed by popular all-female groups that mix Indigenous rhythms from Ecuador and Peru into a danceable format.</p>
