          <p>The Trump administration is set to revoke the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. Nvidia shares rose following the announcement, with the company expressing its support for the administration's new direction on AI policy, stating it will allow America to lead the next industrial revolution and create high-paying U.S. jobs. The rule, proposed by the Biden administration, would have organized countries into tiers with varying restrictions on AI chip exports, and was scheduled to take effect on May 15. Optimism is high that this move will stimulate technological innovation and economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a comprehensive trade agreement with the United Kingdom, the first since imposing "reciprocal" tariffs. The deal is expected to strengthen the relationship between the two countries. While Trump touted the agreement as a done deal on Truth Social, 10 Downing Street indicated that negotiations were still ongoing. The UK is affected by separate U.S. tariffs on imports of steel, aluminum, and foreign-made cars, and this deal may signal a broader shift in trade policy.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge has dismissed most of the claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, including stars like Tom Brady, Gisele B√ºndchen, Kevin O'Leary, and Stephen Curry. The ruling narrows the scope of a multidistrict litigation accusing them of using their fame to market a fraudulent platform. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of FTX investors, failed to demonstrate that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried's misconduct to be held liable for promoting the exchange. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's catastrophic collapse in November 2022, which wiped out billions of dollars in customer funds and triggered investigations worldwide.</p>
