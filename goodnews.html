        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a significant coffee boom, with consumption rapidly expanding beyond major cities into the countryside. This trend is fueled by a growing number of rural cafes that leverage unique natural settings to attract social media-savvy customers. While the coffee industry is now valued at $42 billion and expected to continue its double-digit growth, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this influencer-driven business model, as the novelty for consumers may fade quickly. The article highlights the cultural shift as coffee challenges tea's traditional dominance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in the opening of NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. This signing came shortly after the team lost a key defensive player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who reportedly agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been an important contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, brings strong three-point shooting to the team, having shot over 42% from beyond the arc last season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government has launched a "landmark" review of its parental leave and pay policies, aiming to modernize a system that critics have called outdated and flawed. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have been largely unchanged for decades. Campaigners have praised the move, noting that issues like low take-up of shared leave and unaffordable paternity pay need to be addressed. The current statutory paternity leave is the least generous in Europe, and the system's complexities are seen as a barrier for many working families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new wave of younger investors is significantly shaping market trends by backing companies with bold, forward-thinking concepts rather than established fundamentals. He suggests these investors are rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit for their innovative approaches, viewing them as potential future powerhouses, while penalizing more traditional companies. This shift indicates a "story-dominated market" where the potential of an idea is valued highly, often over immediate earnings or Federal Reserve policy considerations. These investors are more focused on individual stock narratives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet observed significant price increases for consumers resulting from recent U.S. tariffs. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making large forward purchases of inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy explained that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, also helps keep prices down, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides a corporate perspective on how businesses are navigating the uncertain trade policy environment.</p>

Investors responded positively to the news that Core is maintaining its full-year sales volume forecast for coking coal, a key product.

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills fall by 7% starting this week under the latest price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Future costs for the winter are uncertain, with geopolitical instability in the Middle East posing a potential risk to wholesale energy prices, which could reverse the current downward trend.</p>

The new jobs will include roles in research, engineering, and supply chain management. The company plans to cease its washer and dryer manufacturing in China once the Louisville plant becomes fully operational, expected by early 2027.</p>

          <p>Film producer Randall Emmett has been removed from the Writers Guild of America's "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. The move came after Emmett paid $630,000 to resolve a long-standing judgment over unpaid health benefits and compensation owed to four writers from a collapsed 2019 television project. Emmett's former company was responsible for the debt, but he stated he paid it personally because it was "the right thing to do." The resolution clears a significant professional obstacle for the producer as he seeks to move forward with new projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears of renewed inflation, recent U.S. tariffs have not yet caused a significant spike in consumer prices, according to economic data. Economists attribute this to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses. Many companies engaged in "front-loading" by stocking up on inventory before the tariffs hit, while others are temporarily absorbing the costs. Additionally, some importers are using legal loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Experts warn that these buffers are temporary and price increases could still materialize later if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>
