          <p>Myanmar's military has conducted a major raid on KK Park, a well-known cybercrime hub near the Thai border, detaining 2,198 individuals. The operation is part of a broader crackdown on online fraud, which often involves luring foreign workers under false pretenses and forcing them into criminal activities. Authorities also seized dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals used by the operation. The military government has accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group, of involvement, a claim the group denies.</p>

Healy has been a key player for the defending champions, who have already secured a spot in the semi-finals. Beth Mooney will take over as wicketkeeper, while Tahlia McGrath is set to captain the team in Healy's absence. The team is awaiting further assessment to determine if she can return later in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Chinese memory chip manufacturer ChangXin Memory Technologies (CXMT) is reportedly planning an initial public offering in Shanghai, potentially valuing the company at up to $42.12 billion. Sources suggest the listing could occur as early as the first quarter of the upcoming year, aiming to raise between 20 billion and 40 billion yuan. This move is part of China's strategic effort to establish a stronger presence in the global DRAM market, which has historically been dominated by foreign companies. The plan emerges amid a significant rally in China's semiconductor stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

The discovery centers on the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease, and a mechanism that could potentially regulate it. This breakthrough could pave the way for a new therapeutic strategy to combat prostate cancer, a disease that affects an estimated 1.5 million men globally each year. The findings offer hope for more effective treatments that can overcome resistance to current therapies.</p>
