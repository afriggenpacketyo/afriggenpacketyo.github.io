          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked connection between personal finance choices and their impact on the climate crisis, highlighting how pensions, investments, and banking decisions can inadvertently support fossil fuel projects. Sustainable alternatives are available, but many people are unaware of the significant role their money plays in funding the fossil fuel industry. Experts emphasize the difficulty in precisely quantifying personal finance's contribution, but stress that banks use our money to grow their business and attract investors. Shifting to green finance alternatives is a way for customers to send a message, but more power lies in citizens demanding politicians regulate the financial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of Tokyo is considering a program to temporarily accept international students from Harvard University if they are affected by potential U.S. government restrictions. This initiative follows a similar program launched in 2022 to support researchers and students displaced by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, providing research labs and accommodation free of charge. The U.S. government's move to potentially end Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students is under review following a temporary injunction issued by a U.S. federal district court. The Japanese university is currently exploring the details of how such a program would be implemented.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The LEVA robot, developed by ETH Zurich, is designed to autonomously navigate environments and handle heavy cargo, combining wheels and legs for versatile movement. LEVA utilizes GPS, lidar sensors, and cameras to perceive its surroundings, enabling it to avoid obstacles and align itself for cargo pick-up and drop-off. What sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without human intervention, securing boxes weighing up to 187 pounds using powered hooks. This technology could lead to faster, more reliable deliveries, reduced labor costs, and increased efficiency in various industries.</p>

          <p>This article argues that solutions to the nation's big problems start small and local, using the author's experience as a state government official in Minnesota as an example. After mistakenly clawing back unemployment insurance payments from high school students, the author worked with the students and a Republican senator to change the law. The author contends that trust in institutions gets stronger the more local you go, and encourages people to invest in rebuilding local institutions through volunteering, subscribing to local newspapers, and supporting local businesses. The author believes that building momentum at the local level can ultimately drive change at the federal level.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron visited Hanoi, Vietnam, calling for closer cooperation between the two countries in an increasingly unstable global landscape. Macron emphasized the need for an order based on law at a time of both great imbalance and a return to power-driven rhetoric and intimidation. He signed more than a dozen agreements on defense, nuclear power and trade, including one with the Vietnamese budget airline company VietJet and Airbus to buy 20 A330-900 planes. France and Vietnam's ‚Äúsovereignty partnership‚Äù could be the central axis of France‚Äôs approach in the Indo-Pacific, Macron said.</p>
