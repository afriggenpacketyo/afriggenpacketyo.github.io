          <p>Officials have announced a significant drop in the number of individuals unaccounted for following the deadly flash floods in Texas Hill Country, reducing the count from over 100 to just three. This sharp decrease comes after extensive follow-up and verification work by local, state, and federal agencies, which confirmed the safety of many people who were initially reported as missing. The historic floods, which were particularly devastating along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County, resulted in at least 135 fatalities and have prompted calls for legislative action on improving flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has officially confirmed it will launch a full national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent and controversial confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. It will also examine the aftermath, including the eventually collapsed criminal prosecutions of 95 miners, which were based on what has since been described as discredited police evidence.</p>

While Scheffler himself humbly dismisses the comparisons as "silly," his impressive record and recently improved putting game have solidified his status as the undisputed world number one.</p>

Parents are advised to validate their child's feelings, avoid micromanaging, and model their own emotional regulation to help their children develop a strong and trusted inner voice.</p>
