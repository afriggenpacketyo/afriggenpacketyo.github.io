          <p>Nigeria has entered into a significant agreement with a leading Chinese defence company, Norinco, to establish local production of military-grade ammunition, marking a deepening of military ties with Beijing. The deal encompasses the construction of ammunition production lines, maintenance and upgrades of military hardware, battle tank servicing, and military engineering services, as well as technology transfers and training for Nigerian defence personnel. This partnership represents the latest advancement in Nigeria's growing military cooperation with China, which began in the mid-2010s after Nigeria faced difficulties securing defence equipment from the United States during the Boko Haram insurgency peak. This move aims to bolster Nigeria's defence capabilities through technology transfer and local production.</p>

          <p>A project in Iceland, the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT), is attempting to revolutionize volcanology by building a magma observatory to drill into a magma chamber and insert monitoring equipment. Volcanologists face challenges in accurately predicting eruptions, often relying on pattern recognition from past volcanic activity. The KMT aims to improve understanding of magma chambers' underlying physics, potentially leading to more precise eruption forecasts. By gathering real-time data from within an active magma chamber, researchers hope to build models that can predict volcanic behavior as effectively as weather scientists predict hurricanes, ultimately improving public safety and reducing economic disruption.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's agreements to sell advanced chips to the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have ignited internal debate about potentially outsourcing the future of the A.I. industry. These deals, negotiated by administration officials and supported by tech leaders, aim to boost American A.I. companies and expand the nation's lead in the field. However, concerns have been raised about inadequate protections preventing the technology from benefiting China and the possibility of the world's largest data centers being located in the Middle East rather than the United States. This tension highlights contradictions within Trump's policies, balancing the desire for American A.I. dominance with potential risks to national security and domestic job creation.</p>

The bill has undergone six months of review by a parliamentary committee, leading to amendments such as removing the need for a High Court judge's approval. Instead, a panel of experts will oversee the process, MPs are considering amendments to ensure no medical staff are obligated to participate and to prevent doctors from discussing assisted death with patients under 18 unless initiated by the patient. The debate is emotionally charged, with supporters emphasizing individual choice and opponents raising concerns about vulnerable individuals and the role of doctors.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments regarding birthright citizenship, debating the handling of President Trump's executive order denying automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who entered illegally or on temporary visas. The first week of Sean "Diddy" Combs' sex trafficking trial featured testimony by alleged victims, including ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, who described their relationship as marked by violence and blackmail. Prosecutors allege Combs forced two ex-girlfriends into drug-fueled sexual performances and ran a criminal enterprise that concealed those sex crimes. This case raises questions about consent and power dynamics within the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>With the NJ Transit strike underway, supplemental chartered buses will begin running on Monday to assist commuters. These buses will operate from Park & Ride lots around the state to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan or to stations of the PATH train in North Jersey. However, officials warn that these buses can only accommodate about 20 percent of train riders. Commuters with existing NJ Transit rail tickets and passes can use them on the Park & Ride service, as well as on NJ Transit buses and light rail lines, but not on other carriers.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's four-day visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, the Gulf countries displayed remarkable fanfare and pledged significant economic investments. Qatar and the U.S. agreed on a $1.2 trillion "economic exchange"; Saudi Arabia promised to invest $600 billion in the U.S.; and the UAE committed to a 10-year, $1.4 trillion investment framework. These gestures and agreements signal the Gulf states' desire to deepen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic agendas. The visit underscored the Gulf's preference for business-first presidents like Trump, who symbolizes fast money, big defense, and access to American tech.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Defense Ministry Urged to Establish UFO Office</h2>

          <p>Japan's Defense Ministry has been urged to establish an office dedicated to addressing UFOs, formally known as unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), by a cross-party group of lawmakers. The proposal emphasizes that UAP sightings pose realistic and serious national security concerns. The lawmakers are advocating for a Japanese version of the U.S. All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, which was founded in 2022 to address UAP through scientific analysis and data-driven approaches. The proposed office would regularly report investigation progress to parliament and disclose information to the public, aiming to secure territorial airspace and waters.</p>
