          <p>Space technology firm Firefly Aerospace has raised the expected share price for its initial public offering to between $41 and $43, which could value the company at over $6 billion. This updated range would raise nearly $697 million, an increase from the previous target of a $5.5 billion valuation. The move reflects growing investor interest in the space sector, with companies like SpaceX achieving high valuations. Firefly, known for its Alpha rockets and lunar landers, has seen significant revenue growth and holds partnerships with NASA and major defense contractors like Northrop Grumman.

          <p>Following a weak jobs report, market sentiment is leaning towards the Federal Reserve implementing an interest rate cut in September, a move expected to boost stock markets. This comes amid controversy over the jobs data itself, which has been politicized. Separately, analysis from Morgan Stanley indicates that major tech companies, or "hyperscalers," are projected to significantly increase capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, with spending expected to grow 56% in 2025. This sustained investment signals strong confidence in the long-term profitability and demand for generative AI technologies across the tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant surge of over 20% after former President Donald Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced criticism for its perceived double entendre and for being out of touch. Trump's endorsement on social media reversed a recent slump in the stock's performance, highlighting the powerful, and often unpredictable, impact of cultural and political discourse on market behavior. The event has also generated a massive spike in online search interest for the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

Finishing with a time of 1:42.27, he placed second overall in the men's final, nearly catching the champion and securing a spot at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. His performance, which involved an explosive final 200 meters where he moved from seventh to second place, has been hailed by some as one of the most impressive athletic feats in history.

          <p>Liverpool's 16-year-old forward, Rio Ngumoha, is generating significant excitement after a standout performance in a pre-season friendly against Athletic Bilbao at Anfield. The England Under-17 international scored a goal and provided an assist in the opening minutes of the match, continuing a strong summer showing. His impressive dribbling and attacking prowess have led fans and pundits to speculate whether he could break into the first-team squad this season. The context of recent changes in Liverpool's front line, including the tragic death of Diogo Jota and the sale of Luis Diaz, could create an opportunity for the young talent.</p>

          <p>As Skydance Media's $8.4 billion acquisition of Paramount is set to close, new Chairman and CEO David Ellison has unveiled a new leadership structure for the company. The shake-up sees former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell appointed as president and retains only one current top executive, George Cheeks, who will now chair the TV media division. Other key appointments include Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein as co-chairs of Paramount Pictures, and former Netflix programmer Cindy Holland to run streaming services. This new team is tasked with reviving the legendary entertainment company, a process that is expected to include significant cost-cutting measures and a strategic shift in operations.</p>

          <p>Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and his wife, radio host Vick Hope, have announced the birth of their son, Micah. In a social media post, Harris shared a series of photos from the home birth, including a graphic image of the placenta and what appeared to be placenta encapsulation pills. The post has divided fans, with many offering congratulations and praising the couple for normalizing the realities of childbirth. Others expressed surprise and discomfort with the explicit nature of the photos, one of which was later hit with an age restriction by the social media platform. The practice of consuming the placenta is controversial, with limited scientific evidence to support its purported health benefits.</p>

          <p>After a decade of investigation, scientists have identified the cause of a mysterious wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along the Pacific coast of North America. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found to infect shellfish. The epidemic, which began in 2013, has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star population declining by about 90%. The discovery provides a crucial breakthrough, allowing researchers to potentially develop strategies to help the critically endangered species recover, which is vital for the health of the entire marine ecosystem, including kelp forests that have been overgrazed by sea urchins in the sea stars' absence.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were originally set to take effect this week. This suspension provides time for both sides to implement the broader trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and former President Trump. The political agreement, which includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission stated it is working with the U.S. to finalize the details of their joint statement on the deal.</p>

          <h2>New Study Finds Eating Minimally Processed Meals Leads to Double the Weight Loss Compared to Healthy Ultraprocessed Foods</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A randomized controlled clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight when eating a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over eight weeks, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This occurred despite both diets meeting the UK's official nutritional guidelines for fat, sugar, salt, and fiber. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, beyond just nutrient content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 60% Rule for Reverse Mortgages and Its Impact on Senior Borrowers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the "60% rule" significantly impacts senior homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year. The regulation was designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their home equity too quickly, thereby promoting long-term financial stability. However, for seniors facing immediate large expenses, this cap can be a challenge, potentially forcing them to seek other, more expensive forms of credit to cover their needs while they wait to access the remainder of their funds.

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his debut in the horror genre with the new film "Weapons," where he plays a father searching for answers after his child and others mysteriously disappear. Brolin described the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to explore themes of masculinity, particularly how a man who represses emotion reacts when the thing he cares about most is taken away. Although new to acting in horror, Brolin noted that the genre was a significant part of his childhood. After 41 years in the film industry, he said he continues to seek out roles that challenge him and push his creative boundaries.</p>
