          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth place among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming the third position. The United States and Germany remain the top two donors, respectively. The decline in Japan's aid is attributed to the yen's depreciation and the resumption of projects delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the decrease, Japan considers ODA a vital diplomatic tool for promoting a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>
