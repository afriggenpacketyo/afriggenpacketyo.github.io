          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses operating in China are reporting increased difficulties due to regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is advocating for a more favorable policy environment characterized by clear, fairly enforced, and consistently applied rules. Despite these challenges, British firms are maintaining a substantial engagement with the Chinese market, although confidence in China's long-term outlook has declined. Escalating tensions between China and the U.S. are causing delays in investments, both in China and globally, for firms with exposure to the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never purchased rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark perceived as insensitive amid a national rice shortage. The comment highlighted the government's struggle to resolve the rice shortage, which has significantly increased prices for Japanese households. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister in an attempt to mitigate the political fallout. The shortage has been attributed to long-standing policies protecting small farmers, hindering new entrants and leaving agricultural land uncultivated.</p>

Meyer emphasized the measure is about compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice, ensuring Delawareans can face their final moments with peace and control.

          <p>Thames Water has decided to "pause" its controversial bonus scheme for senior executives following public and governmental criticism. The scheme, which could have provided bonuses amounting to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, was linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan for the troubled company. Downing Street deemed it unacceptable for executives to reward themselves after years of mismanagement, and the company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat. Thames Water has faced heavy criticism for sewage discharges and leaks, and the government has been on standby to place the company into special administration.</p>

While surveys show a gender gap in support of far-right parties, young women stand out as more politically interesting due to their increasing turn towards the left. Research indicates that young people hold more progressive values, and the gender gap is driven by a sharp leftward shift among young women. Centre-left parties should focus on the priorities and values of female voters to transform the political debate and mobilize young women to vote.</p>
