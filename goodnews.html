          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 04:41:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data, which will likely be the determining figure for the 'triple lock' policy. This rise would add over £500 annually to the new state pension, bringing it to £12,534.60 per year. However, concerns are growing as this increase pushes the pension closer to the frozen personal tax allowance of £12,570, potentially dragging more retirees into the tax net. The triple lock system, which guarantees an annual pension increase by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or wage growth, continues to be debated due to its rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark stock index closed above the 45,000 mark for the first time, leading gains across Asia-Pacific markets. The rally was reportedly spurred by positive comments from President Donald Trump regarding U.S.-China trade negotiations. South Korea's Kospi also hit a new record after the government canceled a planned capital gains tax hike, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw slight declines. In the U.S., major indices also closed higher as investors anticipated an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, with the S&P 500 closing above 6,600 for the first time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK will feature a blend of royal pageantry and high-stakes political meetings. The agenda includes a formal greeting and carriage procession with King Charles at Windsor Castle, a state banquet, and a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. Key discussion topics are expected to include new UK-US investment deals in technology and energy, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and Britain's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. British officials are also reportedly wary of potential discussions around sensitive issues like migration and Trump's past association with Jeffrey Epstein, hoping the visit focuses on strengthening diplomatic and economic ties.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is seen as a welcome distraction for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government is facing significant domestic challenges. Recent weeks have seen the resignation of his deputy, the dismissal of the U.S. ambassador, and large-scale protests over immigration, leading to plummeting approval ratings for Starmer's Labour Party. The U.K. is rolling out full royal pageantry for the visit, which Starmer hopes will yield positive news on trade and investment, including deals in technology and energy. Despite their political differences, Trump has expressed a fondness for the U.K., which the British government may see as a crucial asset during this turbulent period.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield orchestrated a game-winning 80-yard drive in the final moments, culminating in a Rachaad White touchdown run with just six seconds left to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans. The dramatic finish marked Mayfield's second consecutive game-winning drive to open the season, a feat only one other Buccaneers quarterback has accomplished. The win was a reversal of fortune from the teams' 2023 meeting, where the Texans scored in the final seconds to win. Despite a late touchdown run by Nick Chubb that gave Houston the lead, the Texans were unable to hold on.</p>

          <h2>UK to Introduce 'Hillsborough Law' with Duty of Candour for Public Officials</h2>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The bill includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to fail to act with honesty and integrity, aiming to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen in tragedies like the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, the Grenfell Tower fire, and the Post Office scandal. Hillsborough campaigners, who had feared the legislation would be weakened, have welcomed the news. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law would change the balance of power, ensuring the state can no longer hide from the people it serves.</p>

          <h2>The Science Behind How Women's Rugby Teams Track Menstrual Cycles to Optimize Performance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 01:17:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly tracking their athletes' menstrual cycles to tailor training and nutrition, recognizing the period as a 'fifth vital sign' of female health. Symptoms like fatigue and cramps can impact performance, so teams use apps and daily questionnaires to monitor players' cycles. Based on this data, coaches and physios can make informed adjustments, such as reducing training intensity or adding mobility sessions, without sidelining players. Nutritionists also adapt meal plans to replenish nutrients, while some teams use supplements like 'Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail' to manage pain, ensuring players can perform at their peak throughout their cycle.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to eliminate the 'not proven' verdict from its unique three-verdict legal system. Critics argue the verdict is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims, while some defense lawyers believe it offers an additional safeguard for the accused. To balance this change, the bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The wide-ranging legislation also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and the creation of a new victims and witnesses commissioner.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has stressed the importance of developing a unified domestic market as a crucial strategy for China to gain an advantage in global competition and achieve its development targets. In an article for the Communist Party's theoretical journal, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and cutthroat price competition among companies. The directive encourages industry associations to guide firms toward prioritizing product quality over low prices. This echoes a previous government call to crack down on destructive price wars and phase out obsolete industrial capacity to foster a healthier economic environment.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, the former chief financial officer of Elon Musk's rival AI company, xAI, to oversee its substantial infrastructure spending. This move marks the latest development in the escalating feud between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were co-founders of OpenAI before a public falling out. Liberatore will manage the contracts and capital behind OpenAI's massive compute strategy, including a reported $300 billion deal with Oracle. The hiring comes as OpenAI transitions towards a for-profit structure, a move Musk has legally challenged, further intensifying the competition between the two leading AI ventures.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a "framework" agreement regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok, potentially paving the way for American ownership of the popular social media app. The breakthrough occurred during trade negotiations in Madrid, with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announcing that the commercial terms have been settled, pending final approval from Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping. According to sources, technology company Oracle is part of a consortium that would enable TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a nationwide ban over national security concerns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Los Angeles Dodgers plan to use Shohei Ohtani primarily as a starting pitcher in the postseason, the team has not ruled out deploying him as a reliever in high-leverage situations. Team officials acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could necessitate using him out of the bullpen, similar to how starter Walker Buehler was used to clinch the 2024 World Series. However, MLB's two-way player rules present a complication: if Ohtani enters as a reliever, the Dodgers would lose his potent bat as the designated hitter once he leaves the mound. This tactical constraint means any potential relief appearance would have to be carefully weighed against the cost of losing him as a hitter.</p>
