          <p>Newcastle United has successfully negotiated a £55 million deal to acquire forward Yoane Wissa from Brentford before the transfer deadline. The agreement, which includes an initial £50 million fee plus £5 million in add-ons, was reached after Wissa publicly expressed his desire to leave the club. This move is part of Newcastle's strategy to strengthen their attack, particularly following the record-breaking sale of striker Alexander Isak to Liverpool. Wissa, who turns 29 this week, is seen as a proven Premier League talent capable of filling the offensive gap for the Magpies.</p>

          <p>In a personal column, a writer shares her experience of becoming an "empty nester" after her third and youngest child departs for college, ending a 27-year period of active parenting. She describes the sudden quiet and lack of structure as disorienting, missing the daily rhythms and even the chaos that children bring to a household. To cope with this significant life change, she creates a list of resolutions for herself, such as maintaining a routine, eating proper meals, and finding new activities. The article reflects on the profound shift in identity and daily life that parents face when their children grow up and leave home.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art's new David Geffen Galleries building is preparing for its 2026 opening by installing its first commissioned artwork, a photo sculpture by artist Todd Gray. The piece, titled “Octavia Butler’s Gaze,” is being mounted on the vast concrete walls designed by architect Peter Zumthor. The installation process highlights unique features of the new space, including a specialized glazing technique being applied to gallery walls instead of traditional paint. The museum's curatorial approach will focus on creating dialogues between different cultures and eras rather than chronological or regional groupings.</p>

          <p>A former Macy's parking structure at the iconic, now-closed Westside Pavilion mall in Los Angeles has been transformed into a 201-unit luxury apartment complex. The project, named Overland & Ayres, reflects a growing trend of repurposing defunct shopping centers into mixed-use properties, including much-needed housing. The rest of the former mall, famous for its appearance in the film "Clueless," is being converted by UCLA into a major research facility. The new apartments feature high-end amenities and offer a housing solution in a prime location, convenient for those working at the new research center or nearby job hubs.</p>

          <h2>Norwegian Energy Giant Equinor Pledges Support for Orsted Amid U.S. Offshore Wind Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 05:47:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwegian state-backed energy company Equinor has pledged nearly $1 billion in new capital to support Denmark's Orsted, the world's largest offshore wind developer. This move signals confidence in the sector despite sustained attacks on offshore wind projects by the Trump administration, which recently canceled significant federal funding for related infrastructure. Equinor, Orsted's second-largest shareholder, intends to participate in a planned rights issue and will nominate a candidate to Orsted's board. The investment comes as Orsted's stock has plummeted, partly due to political uncertainty and project halts in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Annual house price growth in the UK slowed to 2.1% in August, down from 2.4% in July, according to data from lender Nationwide. This cooling of the market comes amid reports that the government is considering a significant overhaul of property taxes, including stamp duty and council tax, in the upcoming Autumn budget. While mortgage rates have eased slightly following the Bank of England's latest interest rate cut, housing affordability remains a major challenge for many prospective buyers. Experts suggest that comprehensive tax reform could help improve market mobility and efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

Shares of BAE Systems, the company building the frigates, rose by 3%, with other European defense firms also seeing significant gains. In the health-care sector, Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk saw its stock climb after releasing favorable trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy, suggesting superior heart disease risk reduction compared to rivals.

          <p>ScotRail, the Scottish government-owned train operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel during busy weekday rush hours. The policy aims to make rail travel more affordable and encourage commuters to switch from cars to trains, with some key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow becoming nearly 50% cheaper. This decision follows a pilot scheme that ended in 2024. The government expects the move to cost between £40 million and £45 million annually, which will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger revenue.</p>

          <p>A research team in China has created the world's first rubber band-like material that can efficiently convert body heat into electricity, a breakthrough that could lead to self-charging wearable devices. The material combines elasticity with high thermoelectric conversion, a property previously unattained in flexible materials. By harnessing the temperature difference between the human body (around 37°C) and the surrounding air, this technology could provide a constant power source for devices like smartwatches. This innovation offers a potential solution to the need for bulky batteries and frequent charging in the growing market of wearable electronics.</p>

          <p>Hedge funds are increasingly using options to wager that China's yuan will continue to rally against the U.S. dollar, with some traders targeting a rate of 7 or stronger by year-end. This growing confidence is attributed to expectations of further policy support from Beijing and a potential shift in U.S. interest rate policy. The demand for options that profit from a rising yuan has picked up as the dollar has come under pressure. This market sentiment reflects an improving outlook on Chinese assets, supported by fiscal measures and perceived progress in U.S.-China trade discussions. (not investment advice)</p>
