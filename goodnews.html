          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to maintain control of the California National Guard, but emphasized a portion of the ruling as a victory. Newsom stated that the court rejected Trump's claim of unchecked authority over the National Guard and affirmed that the President is not above the law. The court's ruling prevented Trump from federalizing the California National Guard at will and avoiding judicial scrutiny, which Newsom's office hailed as a crucial check on presidential overreach. Despite this, the conflict continues as Trump retains control of the National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles to manage riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

Durov stated that all his children will have equal rights to the inheritance to prevent conflicts after his death. While officially recognizing six children with three different partners, Durov has fathered over 100 children through sperm donations to a fertility clinic. The article also mentions that Durov's children will not have access to their inheritance for 30 years, as he wishes them to live like normal people and build their own lives independently. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, describing them as absurd.</p>

The condition, where one eye is weaker than the other, is best corrected before the age of seven.

The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more.

          <p>China has been urged to use the resumption of visits to Tibet by Indian pilgrims to improve relations between the two countries after years of tensions. Earlier this year, China said it would allow pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer to follow two pilgrimage routes after a five-year suspension caused by Covid controls and ongoing cross-border tensions. It is open to Indian citizens with valid passports who wish to travel to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar for religious reasons. The pilgrimages are usually organised by the Indian government and involve treks through the Lipulekh Pass in Uttarakhand or Nathu La Pass in Sikkim.</p>

          <p>Japan's Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are scheduled to make a state visit to Mongolia from July 6 to 13, marking the first such trip by a Japanese emperor. During the visit, the imperial couple will lay flowers at a memorial to commemorate Japanese nationals who died in internment camps after World War II. The itinerary also includes attendance at the opening ceremony of Naadam, Mongolia's largest annual festival. It will be the imperial couple's first overseas goodwill visit since their trip to Britain last June.</p>
