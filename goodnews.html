        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu, an assortment of common cold viruses, is prevalent among new university students due to factors like close living quarters, late nights, poor diet, and stress, which collectively suppress the immune system. Immunologists explain that students are exposed to a cocktail of novel respiratory viruses, and their compromised immunity makes them highly susceptible to prolonged symptoms that often feel worse than a typical cold. While generally not serious, the illness can significantly impact academic performance and social life, underscoring the critical importance of rest and healthy habits even amidst the intense social pressures of freshers' week. Students are advised to seek medical help if symptoms persist or worsen, to rule out more serious bacterial infections.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated Israel is 'on the verge of a very great achievement,' expressing hope to announce the return of all hostages from Gaza 'in the coming days' under a proposed peace plan. President Trump also affirmed Israel's agreement to an initial withdrawal line and warned Hamas to act quickly or face consequences. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are set to begin in Egypt, with a senior Israeli official indicating a halt in IDF offensive activity is meant to allow Hamas to organize hostage releases. The situation remains delicate, balancing hopes for peace with underlying military and political complexities.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, 64, has been elected leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on its 70th anniversary, positioning her to become the country's first female prime minister after two previous attempts. Known as a staunch conservative and a protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, she aims to revive his 'Abenomics' economic vision and has recently softened her stance on social issues to include childcare support. Her personal experiences inform policy proposals on women's health and caregiving, while her political career has seen her serve in senior government roles and build a reputation as an outspoken conservative voice. This marks a significant moment for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>Thousands gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism for a ceasefire deal proposed by President Trump, which Hamas has accepted. Protesters, many crediting Trump for the progress, voiced their fervent desire for the return of hostages held since October 7, 2023, and for a return to normalcy. The U.S. plan includes a hostage-for-prisoner exchange, phased Israeli withdrawal, and a technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza. Despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's claims of military success leading to Hamas's shift, many protesters distrust his motives, fearing he might sabotage the deal to remain in power, reflecting deep societal divisions.</p>
