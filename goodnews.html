          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock on the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City, injuring dozens. The boat hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park, causing passengers to fall as they were waiting to disembark. Thirty-five people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and twenty-two were transported to local hospitals for treatment. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which follows a similar event a month prior when a Mexican navy training ship struck the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights for American citizens from Israel, with two flights departing from Tel Aviv to Athens carrying approximately 70 individuals, including family members and lawful permanent residents.

The State Department has also issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel, urging Americans not to travel there due to ongoing conflict and unrest. Meanwhile, other evacuation efforts are being organized by private organizations and state governments, as tensions between Israel and Iran intensify.</p>

          <p>General practices in England are facing increasing demand for appointments, leading to a frustrating "8am scramble" for patients trying to book same-day slots. Receptionists often bear the brunt of patient frustration, with limited appointments available and high call volumes. The government has pledged additional funding to improve access, including online booking and expanded healthcare teams to alleviate pressure on GPs. While this model aims to provide doctors more time for complex cases, the overall situation remains challenging, with record numbers of appointments offered but demand still outpacing capacity.</p>

          <p>Pop-punk band South Arcade is finding success by tapping into Y2K core, a growing interest in the culture of the late 90s and early 2000s. The band's sound is influenced by artists like Rihanna, Korn, and Justice, creating music reminiscent of MTV and 90s slasher movie soundtracks. Despite being born at the start of the millennium, band members draw inspiration from older siblings and friends, bringing a nostalgic feel to their music. They gained traction on TikTok, connecting with both fans who experienced the Y2K era and younger audiences discovering it for the first time.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, giant statues of Michael Jackson were erected around the world to promote his album HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I. These statues followed Jackson on his global tour, but their fates have varied greatly since then. Some statues have been lost, destroyed, or locked in storage, while others remain on display in unexpected locations. One statue stood for decades at a McDonald's in the Netherlands before being removed due to controversy, while another resides in a defunct nightclub in Austria. These statues serve as a reminder of Jackson's global impact and enduring legacy.</p>

          <p>Social media is filled with advice on how to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone, but experts warn against relying on quick fixes. While cortisol is essential for bodily functions, too much can lead to health problems. Many social media hacks, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, lack scientific evidence and may not address the underlying causes of stress. Therapists and experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes, cautioning that simplistic solutions can prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment.</p>
