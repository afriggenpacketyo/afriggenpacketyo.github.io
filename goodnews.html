          <p>Newcastle United has cancelled 45 tickets purchased by a school for their Champions League home game against Barcelona, angering fans who struggled to obtain tickets. The High School of Dundee, located nearly 200 miles away, had bought the tickets in good faith after being approached with an offer. The Newcastle United Supporters Trust expressed dismay, noting the difficulty many fans faced in securing seats. It was determined that the tickets were acquired through unauthorized reselling, leading to the cancellation of the original season tickets.</p>

The fintech company, recognized for its buy now, pay later services, priced shares at $40 on Tuesday, amassing $1.37 billion for both the company and its existing shareholders. Klarna's entry into the public market serves as a test of Wall Street's enthusiasm for its business direction, particularly its expansion into banking with debit cards and personal deposit accounts in the U.S. The company faces regulatory hurdles in the U.K. concerning BNPL loans.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 2.9% in August compared to the previous year, aligning with economists' expectations that prices would slightly increase due to President Trump's tariffs. The CPI measures changes in prices for everyday consumer goods and services, and this increase edges away from the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. Economists attribute the rise to the Trump administration's tariffs, which U.S. businesses pay and pass on to consumers. The Federal Reserve has been hesitant to cut rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation, but signs of strain in the labor market may open the door for a rate cut.

          <p>Opendoor announced that Kaz Nejatian, former Shopify executive, will be the new CEO, and Keith Rabois, co-founder, will be chairman, leading to a 36% stock increase. The moves follow Carrie Wheeler's resignation as CEO after pressure from investors, including Rabois. The company was at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq in May, but recently attracted retail investor interest, gaining "meme stock" status. Opendoor went public through a special purpose acquisition company in 2020 and operates by buying and selling homes using technology.</p>

          <h2>Lasry Doubts Ballmer Circumvented NBA Salary Cap</h2>

          <p>Former Milwaukee Bucks owner Marc Lasry expressed skepticism that L.A. Clippers owner Steve Ballmer attempted to circumvent the NBA's salary cap by working with a third-party company to pay Kawhi Leonard. Lasry stated that he has always found Ballmer to be honorable and a gentleman. The allegation stemmed from a report that Leonard signed a $28 million sponsorship deal with Aspiration, in which Ballmer invested $50 million. Ballmer and the Clippers have denied the allegations, and Aspiration has filed for bankruptcy, with its co-founders charged with fraud.</p>

          <p>Family offices are increasing their investments in stocks while reducing their allocations to private equity, according to a Goldman Sachs survey. The average allocation to public equities rose to 31%, while private equity dropped to 21%. This shift is notable for U.S. and Americas-based family offices, with concerns about geopolitical risks and inflation influencing investment decisions. Family offices are also using public equities and ETFs to invest in artificial intelligence, and they are making opportunistic plays in private equity secondaries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than 300 South Korean workers arrested in a U.S. immigration raid are being sent home after being detained for allegedly working illegally at a South Korean-invested electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia. The incident sparked outrage in South Korea and threatened to hinder economic cooperation between the two countries. The U.S. has agreed to allow the workers to reenter the United States in the future and transport them to the airport without restraints. The incident stems from a lack of visa quotas for skilled South Korean workers.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has ruled that husbands can take the surname of their wives, overturning a law that barred them from doing so. The court deemed the law as gender-based discrimination, a victory for two couples who brought the case forward. Parliament will now amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the ruling. The couples argued that the law was archaic and violated equality rights enshrined in the constitution.</p>
