          <p>Following a major energy agreement between the European Union and the United States, stocks for liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant rise. The deal, which involves the EU purchasing $750 billion in US energy, is intended to decrease Europe's reliance on Russian gas and oil. Companies involved in LNG exportation and infrastructure, such as Cheniere and New Fortress Energy, saw their share prices climb. This energy pact is a key component of a larger trade deal that also includes new tariffs and substantial EU investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California first-year students for the fall 2025 term, according to new data. This move addresses public demand for prioritizing in-state students, with the system-wide admission rate for Californians rising to 77%. The data also shows continued growth in racial diversity and an increase in students who are the first in their family to attend college. Despite financial pressures, UC also increased admission offers to international students to ensure a diverse student body and secure revenue from nonresident tuition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the FOMC is not a government agency subject to the federal "Sunshine Act," which mandates open meetings. The lawsuit was filed by a known ally of President Trump who has been critical of the Fed's interest rate policies. The judge questioned whether the legal action was a publicity stunt for the new investment fund.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 4% Rule and Its Application to Annuities for Retirees</h2>

          <p>A well-known retirement income strategy, the "4% rule," suggests that retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings for at least 30 years. This article explores how the rule applies when annuities are part of a retirement plan. It serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income from an annuity against what could be drawn from a traditional portfolio. While an annuity might offer a higher payout rate and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks the inflation adjustments and flexibility of the standard 4% rule.

          <p>The Trump Organization has filed a federal lawsuit against unnamed online merchants for allegedly selling counterfeit merchandise on major platforms like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay. The complaint accuses these sellers of marketing "inferior imitations" of Trump-branded products, including T-shirts, hats, and mugs, without proper licensing. The company is seeking a court order to stop the use of its trademarks, compel the marketplaces to destroy the counterfeit goods, and shut down the responsible seller accounts. This legal action targets the unauthorized use of the brand's intellectual property in the booming online marketplace.</p>

However, the recent trade deal with the European Union and a strong global growth backdrop have led to increased optimism. While tariffs are still seen as a drag on growth, the risk of a severe recession is now considered to be easing. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit was filed by Planned Parenthood in response to a provision in a recent tax bill aimed at defunding the organization.

The two-year POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants in the intensive lifestyle program not only boosted their mental abilities but also appeared to slow the cognitive declines typically associated with aging, scoring similarly to people one to two years younger. These findings suggest that proactive lifestyle changes can alter the trajectory of brain aging.</p>
