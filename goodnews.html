          <p>The Trump administration, through Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has released 230,000 previously classified documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. These files, now available on the National Archives website, contain details about the FBI's investigation, internal memos, and information concerning potential leads in the case. The release aims to provide greater transparency on the nearly 60-year-old investigation into the civil rights leader's murder in Memphis.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Reverse Mortgages Could Offer Financial Relief for Seniors in Current Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:17:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns over Social Security's future, reverse mortgages are being presented as a viable financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older. This financial product allows seniors to convert their home equity into cash payments without the burden of immediate monthly repayments, which is particularly advantageous in a high-interest-rate environment. The article suggests this option can supplement retirement income and may be easier to qualify for than other large loans, given high home equity values. However, it is noted that this is not a universal solution for all seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage containing prebiotic fiber and cane sugar, set to be available this fall. This move comes four months after the company acquired Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, for $1.95 billion, signaling a strategic shift towards health-conscious consumers. The launch reflects a broader industry trend of adapting to declining traditional soda consumption by incorporating functional ingredients. The new product aims to capture a share of the growing market for gut-health-focused drinks.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has officially signed winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal reportedly worth an initial £65 million. The 25-year-old Cameroon international has signed a five-year contract with the club, calling it a dream move to the team he supported growing up. Mbeumo's transfer follows a productive season where he scored 20 Premier League goals, and he is manager Ruben Amorim's third major signing of the summer.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For Americans struggling with high credit card debt, debt management programs offer a potential solution by consolidating payments and negotiating lower interest rates with creditors. However, enrollment is not automatic and typically requires meeting three key criteria. Prospective participants must demonstrate a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new consolidated payment. They must also have a manageable amount of unsecured debt, as these plans do not cover secured loans like mortgages. Finally, individuals must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which often include closing credit accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

NPH is caused by excess fluid in the brain and can affect balance and cognition.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced a major change to its long-standing business model, confirming it will end its open seating policy and begin offering assigned seats on January 27, 2026. This move abandons the carrier's iconic first-come, first-served boarding process in favor of a system that allows customers to select specific seats and purchase options like extra legroom. The airline is also overhauling its boarding sequence, grouping passengers by seat location. This shift follows other recent changes, such as ending its "bags fly free" policy, signaling a new revenue strategy.</p>

The move was strongly condemned by local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, who called the military presence "inappropriate." A Pentagon spokesperson stated the withdrawal was prompted by the return of stability to the city.</p>

De Gelder also recommends maintaining eye contact with the animal, as sharks prefer to ambush their prey from behind. As a final resort, he suggests pushing firmly on the shark's sensitive nose to drive it away. His advice comes amid recent shark sightings off the U.S. East Coast.</p>
