          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift and NFL player Travis Kelce announced their engagement via an Instagram post, featuring photos of the proposal and accompanied by Swift's ballad "So High School," widely believed to be written about Kelce. The announcement, which quickly garnered over 18 million likes, showcased Swift's cushion-cut diamond ring and a romantically staged woodland setting. Travis's father, Ed Kelce, later shared details, revealing the proposal took place roughly two weeks earlier in a Lee's Summit, Missouri garden, followed by joyful video calls to family. Fans reacted with immense enthusiasm, considering the engagement a significant and deeply relatable moment in Swift's carefully cultivated public persona and journey.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Football League (AFL) player Mitch Brown has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history, a significant moment for global professional men's sports. Brown, who played for the West Coast Eagles, disclosed that the burden of concealing his sexuality played a "huge" part in his decision to retire, and he hopes his announcement will create a more inclusive environment for others. He criticized the AFL's "hyper-masculinity" and recalled hearing numerous homophobic comments on the field, emphasizing the urgent need for cultural change. Experts believe Brown's candidness about the sport's issues could significantly influence behavior and acceptance at clubs across Australia.</p>

          <p>European markets opened higher, with traders keenly anticipating the quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia, which serves as a crucial bellwether for the global technology sector and the burgeoning artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia's substantial market value and significant weighting in the S&P 500 give it an outsized influence on US market performance. France's CAC 40 index rebounded, recovering from recent investor anxieties sparked by potential political instability after opposition parties indicated they would not support Prime Minister Francois Bayrou in an upcoming confidence vote. The pan-European Stoxx 600 also experienced broad-based gains across various sectors, contributing to a relatively strong month overall for the regional index. (not investment advice)</p>

The 10th test flight achieved crucial developmental milestones, including its first successful payload deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, the relighting of its Raptor engine in orbit, and a stress trial of its reusable heat shield. Following stage separation, the reusable Super Heavy booster executed a controlled splashdown in the Gulf Coast, with the spacecraft completing its run and splashing down in the Indian Ocean. This success is vital for SpaceX's commercial dominance, NASA's Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon, and advances Elon Musk's broader aspirations for Mars colonization.</p>

          <h2>China's Property Market Shows Recovery Signs with Improved Developer Earnings</h2>

          <p>China's embattled property market is showing tentative signs of recovery, as major developers like state-owned China Resources Land (CR Land) and privately-owned Sunac have posted improved interim financial results. CR Land's first-half net profit increased by 16.2% to 11.9 billion yuan, bolstered by a 25.8% rise in property development revenue and strong retail sales from its shopping centers. Sunac, a significant private developer, managed to narrow its interim loss by 14.4% to 12.8 billion yuan, primarily due to reduced operating and financing costs. These positive outcomes suggest that government stimulus measures and a recovering retail consumption environment are beginning to stabilize an industry that previously grappled with severe debt and sluggish sales.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century walrus tusk figurine, which curators believe to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. The partially damaged 1.2-inch piece depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, challenging the popular image of Vikings as wild or savage. Curator Peter Pentz suggests the figure, possibly an ancient board game piece representing a king, could even be King Harald Bluetooth, signifying high status. Originally discovered in Norway in 1796 and subsequently forgotten in museum archives, its detailed and smiling expression stands in stark contrast to other simpler Viking-era human depictions, rendering it a truly unique archaeological find.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Lewis Hamilton's challenging inaugural season with Ferrari, where he has faced struggles for competitiveness and has frequently been out-qualified by his teammate Charles Leclerc. While acknowledging a natural adaptation period to a new team and Leclerc's exceptional talent, the article delves into Hamilton's recent performance trends and his difficulties adjusting to the current generation of Formula 1 cars, which demand a distinct driving style. The piece also thoughtfully explores the inevitable question of age, as Hamilton turned 40 this year, and how biological aging can subtly affect an athlete's adaptability and sustained peak performance. It speculates whether forthcoming rule changes next year could potentially better suit his ingrained driving style.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system, designed to enhance the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants. The China Institute of Atomic Energy conducted this proof-of-principle simulation for a passive heat removal system specifically for integral fast reactors, marking a significant breakthrough in the development of fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional thermal reactors that use slow neutrons and water for cooling, fast reactors utilize high-energy neutrons, making them more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding new fissile material from consumed fuel. This technological advancement is crucial for improving nuclear safety and promoting long-term sustainability in energy production.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, representing a notable recovery from steeper drops in prior months, which signals the initial effectiveness of Beijing's campaign against "involution," or excessive price wars. Profits at major industrial firms collectively fell 1.7% in the first seven months, with the mining sector experiencing a significant decline, while the manufacturing and utilities industries saw improvements. Statistician Yu Weining attributed this recovery to government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels, which in turn improved corporate profitability. Analysts suggest that while the "anti-involution" campaign carries both political and economic motivations, deflationary pressures are likely to persist until broader market consolidation and the exit of uncompetitive firms occur.

Fearnley also had to contend with a rambunctious heckling fan who notably switched allegiance mid-match. His rapid ascent in the world rankings over the past 15 months, soaring from outside the top 500 to cracking the top 50, has been remarkable despite his relative inexperience at the Grand Slam level. He is now set for a rematch against German third seed Alexander Zverev in the second round.</p>

Although originally intended to be unearthed in "hundreds of years," the capsule was recovered early to facilitate the construction of a new children's cancer center.
