          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could reach a value of $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan involves awarding Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious market capitalization, production, and profitability goals. To receive the full award, Tesla's market cap would need to grow to $8.5 trillion, and the company must meet targets for vehicle delivery, robotaxi deployment, and humanoid robot production. This proposal follows a Delaware court's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018. (not investment advice)</p>

Hamilton, who faces a five-place grid penalty for the main race, set the fastest time. The session was briefly interrupted by a red flag after a driver went off track and spread gravel on the circuit. Several other drivers also experienced minor incidents, while Mercedes driver George Russell ended his session early due to a power loss issue with his car.</p>

          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday as investors reacted to a U.S. jobs report that showed a significant slowdown in hiring, reinforcing expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The weak American labor data led to a decline in the U.S. dollar, boosting European indices like the Stoxx 600. In corporate news, shares of Danish wind farm developer Orsted fluctuated after it secured shareholder approval for a major rights issue while also slightly lowering its earnings guidance. The market's positive reaction suggests investors are prioritizing monetary easing over concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An internal NFL report from the 2024 season reveals a wide disparity in ticket revenue among its 32 teams, with the San Francisco 49ers generating the most and the Tennessee Titans the least. The 49ers collected $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, significantly above the league average, while also charging the highest average price for general admission seats. The data highlights how teams contribute to a shared revenue pool, known as the visiting team's share, which is then redistributed among all franchises. This financial structure helps support league-wide parity and funds programs for stadium construction and renovations.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a major renovation initiative across its U.S. locations, aiming to create more welcoming and accessible environments for all customers. As part of a plan to update roughly 1,000 cafes by 2026, the company is reintroducing more seating, using cozier design elements like dark wood paneling, and implementing features such as less harsh lighting for light-sensitive individuals. This effort marks a strategic shift to restore the brand's reputation as a "third place" for customers to gather, moving away from a recent focus on mobile orders and grab-and-go service. The changes are intended to encourage customers to stay longer and improve the overall cafe experience.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur on September 7, 2025, and will be visible across Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, creating a spectacular "blood moon" effect. This phenomenon happens when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that envelops the lunar surface. Sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere gives the moon a distinct reddish-orange hue, with the intensity of the color indicating the amount of dust and clouds present. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye and provides a prolonged astronomical event for skywatchers.</p>

          <p>India has announced a major simplification of its Goods and Service Tax (GST) system in an effort to stimulate domestic demand and counteract the economic impact of recent U.S. tariffs. The reforms, dubbed GST 2.0, will reduce the number of tax slabs and lower rates on items like apparel and footwear, aiming to ease the financial burden on businesses and consumers. This strategic move comes shortly after the U.S. imposed harsh 50 percent tariffs on Indian goods, leaving the country facing significant economic pressure. The overhaul is intended to boost manufacturing, improve cash flow, and lower inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The process of joining a college sorority, particularly in the American South, has become so competitive that a cottage industry of professional rush coaches has emerged. These coaches, who can charge thousands of dollars, train young women on conversation skills, wardrobe choices, and social etiquette to help them secure a bid from an elite sorority. Driven by social media trends like #BamaRush, the demand for these services is growing, with some parents viewing it as an essential investment in their daughters' social and future professional networks. Critics, however, point out that this trend further exacerbates the exclusivity and homogeneity of the Greek system.</p>

          <p>New legislation signed by President Trump has increased the cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change primarily benefits taxpayers in high-tax states who itemize their deductions, although the benefit begins to phase out for those with a modified adjusted gross income above $500,000. Tax experts suggest that affected individuals can maximize the new limit through strategies like prepaying property taxes or fourth-quarter state income taxes before the end of the calendar year. The cap is scheduled to revert to $10,000 in 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a White House dinner, Google CEO Sundar Pichai thanked President Trump for his administration's "constructive dialogue" following a favorable court ruling in the company's landmark antitrust case. The U.S. Department of Justice case found Google held an illegal monopoly but the judge ruled against breaking up the company, a decision that added $230 billion to its market capitalization. During the exchange, President Trump incorrectly claimed the lawsuit was initiated by the Biden administration, when it was in fact filed during his first term. Pichai also praised the administration's AI action plan, highlighting the ongoing collaboration between big tech and the government.</p>

          <p>Germany's new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, has reaffirmed the government's commitment to achieving climate neutrality by 2045, despite facing resistance and calls to prioritize economic recovery. While some members of the ruling coalition have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of current climate targets, Schneider insists that climate protection remains a top priority. A career politician with limited prior experience in environmental policy, he aims to work quietly behind the scenes to build international consensus and avoid the highly politicized domestic debates of recent years. His approach focuses on finding pragmatic solutions and ensuring climate policy is implemented fairly.</p>
