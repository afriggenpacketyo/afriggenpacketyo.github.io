          <p>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS experienced a rise during their U.S. public market debut on Friday, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. This listing comes after more than 15 years of planning, marked by postponements and a Brazilian government investigation into corruption within the company. JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company, has faced opposition to its U.S. listing due to its history of corruption and bribery allegations. The SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April, with shareholders approving the move the following month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is hosting a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army in Washington, D.C., the capital's first major military parade in more than three decades. Military parades in the U.S. are relatively rare, typically held to celebrate the end of a war or the return of military personnel. The last major military display was in 1991 to mark the end of the Gulf War, which drew some pushback over its cost. Presidential inaugural parades have also included military personnel, but these have become less common since the 1960s.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. military prepares for a parade, Cmdr. Emily Shilling, a transgender Navy pilot barred from service, reflects on patriotism. Shilling, president of Sparta Pride, notes that "military might does not equal patriotism," but rather, dedication to service. She is the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's ban on transgender service members. Shilling, eligible for retirement in September, chose to voluntarily separate from the military to retain benefits, but feels she was coerced into the decision.</p>

Veteran investors should hold steady, consider buying more if gold is below the recommended portfolio limit, and remember the initial reasons for investing. (not investment advice)</p>
