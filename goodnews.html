        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's Liberal Democrat party has suggested using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to clear the nation's significant asylum application backlog. The proposal includes establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of asylum caseworkers to 4,000. According to the party's home affairs spokeswoman, this emergency measure is necessary to secure the funds and resources required to quickly end the government's costly reliance on hotels for housing asylum seekers. The plan is part of a broader call for a more efficient and humane immigration system.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session that was halted by a record six red flags. The session was repeatedly interrupted by crashes, including one by McLaren's Oscar Piastri in the final segment, which hampered his and his teammate Lando Norris's performance. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments after the last restart, narrowly beating Williams' Carlos Sainz. The chaotic conditions led to a surprising starting grid, with other top drivers like Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton failing to advance to the final top-10 shootout.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, a British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and have returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, who are in their 70s and 80s, had lived in Afghanistan for nearly two decades running a charitable training program. They were detained in February, with the Taliban claiming they had broken local laws, though specific reasons were never disclosed. Their release was secured following Qatar-brokered negotiations, and they were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to Heathrow Airport, expressing a desire to eventually return to Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>Great Britain's hopes for a first Billie Jean King Cup title were dashed after a 2-0 defeat to the United States in the semifinals. The tie was decided after Katie Boulter lost a hard-fought match against world number seven Jessica Pegula, who rallied to win 3-6, 6-4, 6-2. Earlier, Britain's Sonay Kartal was defeated by Emma Navarro in another close three-set battle. The U.S. team, the most successful in the competition's history, will now advance to the final to face defending champions Italy, while Great Britain is left to reflect on its third semifinal appearance in four years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new powers to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. The intervention marks the first use of "golden share" rights, a condition of the company's $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel that grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit the shutdown, U.S. Steel reversed its decision and announced the facility would continue operations. This move underscores President Trump's increasing direct involvement in corporate and industrial policy.</p>

          <p>In an interview at The Atlantic Festival, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She described her decision to re-enter the public sphere with a 2014 Vanity Fair essay as a way to reclaim her narrative and serve as a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky noted that younger generations have been more receptive to her story, questioning the power dynamics at play during the scandal. She also discussed the cultural shifts since the 1990s, including the rise of the #MeToo movement and new language to describe experiences like gaslighting and slut-shaming.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has sparked hopes for improved bilateral relations, though significant tensions remain. During the conversation, which both sides described as productive and constructive, the leaders discussed trade frictions and a deal concerning TikTok. Following the call, President Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting with Xi at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea and a potential visit to China early next year. However, analysts caution that major points of friction, such as U.S. tariff threats and confrontations in the Taiwan Strait, could undermine this positive momentum.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by rising tuition costs and political turmoil in the United States. Data indicates a steady increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants reporting a significant spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the lower cost of education overseas is a primary motivator, as median tuition in Europe can be substantially cheaper than at U.S. public universities. Students also cite concerns about the domestic political landscape and a desire for a more international perspective as key factors in their decision to pursue higher education abroad.</p>

Rowan now operates 90 studios across the U.S., employs roughly 800 people, and generated over $70 million in revenue last year.

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful ultraviolet A (UVA) rays even when sitting indoors near a window. While windows and clouds can filter out most UVB rays, which cause sunburn, UVA rays can still penetrate deeply into the skin. This "silent killer" exposure is associated with accelerated skin aging, collagen damage, and an increased risk of skin cancer without causing a noticeable burn. To protect against both types of radiation, Dr. Friedman recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher, even on cloudy days or when spending extended time indoors.</p>

The plan seeks to move away from boxing's reliance on disparate promoters and sanctioning bodies toward a centralized, UFC-style model.

In California, the growth occurred in cities that already boast some of the highest median incomes in the country, largely due to the high-paying tech industry.
