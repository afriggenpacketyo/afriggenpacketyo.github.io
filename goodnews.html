          <p>Amazon's Zoox has officially entered the robotaxi market with its launch in Las Vegas, offering free rides in its purpose-built electric vehicles that lack steering wheels or pedals, marking a significant step in the autonomous vehicle industry. Zoox aims to expand its services to San Francisco, Austin, and Miami, and the company differentiates itself from competitors like Waymo and Tesla by designing its robotaxis from the ground up rather than retrofitting existing cars. The company emphasizes rider experience, featuring bidirectional wheels, comfortable seating, and large windows for sightseeing, and the launch follows years of testing and development, including a recent software recall to improve safety. While the company acknowledges the challenges ahead, including ensuring safety and achieving profitability, Amazon is committed to Zoox's long-term vision. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI) surprisingly fell 0.1% in August, signaling a potential easing of inflationary pressures, which could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, and the core PPI, excluding food and energy, also declined by 0.1%. The services sector experienced a 0.2% drop in prices, driven by a significant slide in trade services prices, while goods prices saw a slight increase of 0.1%, and the report is being closely watched for indications of whether policymakers will proceed with an anticipated rate cut. While inflation remains above the Fed's 2% target, officials have expressed confidence that easing housing and wage pressures will push prices lower, and the Fed is also monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on U.S. imports. The market reaction was muted, with traders awaiting the consumer price index print, and the report is expected to support the likelihood of an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

Avelo plans to use the new Embraer jets to modernize its fleet, betting on the planes' seating configuration and quieter cabins to attract customers, and Embraer's E2 jets have been outsold by competitors despite their fuel efficiency. Avelo's CEO highlighted the aircraft's performance, size, and efficiency as ideal for the airline's growth, and the order signifies a strategic move for Avelo to enhance its customer experience and expand its network.

          <p>Experts are weighing in on whether to use home equity to pay off student loans, a strategy that can simplify repayment by consolidating multiple loans into one, but it also carries risks, and using a home equity loan or HELOC can reduce interest rates and lower monthly payments, particularly for those with high-interest private student loans. However, it's crucial to consider the risk of losing valuable loan benefits associated with federal loans, such as Public Service Loan Forgiveness and flexible repayment programs, and homeowners risk foreclosure if they default on the home equity loan. Before proceeding, it is important to shop around for lenders, compare costs, and understand the potential risks and benefits, as this financial move requires careful consideration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The producer price index (PPI) posted an unexpected 0.1% decline in August, leading to increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, and the core PPI, excluding food and energy, also fell by 0.1%, further fueling speculation of monetary easing. The tame reading prompted President Trump to call for immediate rate cuts, criticizing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, but market reaction was muted, with traders awaiting the consumer price index print. The report provided positive news on inflation fundamentals, with the service sector experiencing outright deflation and goods prices rising only slightly, and analysts believe the PPI print essentially rolled out the red carpet for a Fed rate cut next week. The CPI reading is expected to have more weight, as it is the final big data point before the Fed's rate decision. (not investment advice)</p>
