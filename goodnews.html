          <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered remarks at a Juneteenth celebration in Galveston, Texas, where he criticized what he described as "ongoing efforts to erase history." Biden appeared to allude to his successor, President Trump, without explicitly naming him, particularly regarding attempts to remove the moral stain of slavery and rename military bases named after Confederate officers. He highlighted his administration's work in making Juneteenth a federal holiday, emphasizing the importance of remembering America's story and acknowledging the nation's past. Biden received recognition from local officials for his role in establishing Juneteenth as a national holiday, underscoring the significance of the event. The former president emphasized that while darkness can hide much, it can erase nothing. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to withhold transportation grant funding from states that do not cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. Chief U.S. District Judge John McConnell granted a preliminary injunction in a case brought by 20 states, asserting that the Trump administration's conditions on funding were coercive and unrelated to the purpose of transportation funding. McConnell emphasized that the government failed to establish a connection between cooperating with ICE and the objectives of the Department of Transportation. The ruling protects states from potential disruptions to transportation services and infrastructure projects, which are integral to daily life. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has maintained its benchmark lending rates following a reduction last month, as a trade agreement with the United States alleviates some concerns about economic growth. The People's Bank of China kept the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor a consensus reached in Geneva, which allows for trade in rare earth and tech while suspending tariffs. Nomura economists suggest that Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus, but may still ramp up policy support later in the year.

          <p>President Trump marked Juneteenth with a post on Truth Social arguing that the United States has "too many non-working holidays," which he claims are costing the country billions of dollars. The post did not explicitly mention Juneteenth, but it coincided with the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. While federal and state government offices, banks, and stock exchanges are generally closed for Juneteenth, private businesses are not required to close. Trump had previously honored Juneteenth during his presidency and acknowledged its importance. The optimism score for this article is 55.</p>
