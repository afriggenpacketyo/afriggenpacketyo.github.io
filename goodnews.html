          <p>Nvidia surpassed Wall Street expectations for its quarterly earnings and revenue, projecting continued robust sales growth above 50% for the current quarter, signaling persistent strong demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company's data center division is integral to the global AI expansion, with an estimated $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending anticipated by the end of the decade. Although data center revenue slightly missed some estimates and H20 chip sales to China were absent, Nvidia's overall revenue still climbed 56%. The firm also authorized an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in its future trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Will Smith is facing accusations of employing artificial intelligence to generate a fake crowd in a YouTube video that allegedly depicted scenes from a recent tour performance. Sharp-eyed fans identified several purported inaccuracies, including distorted facial features and a disembodied arm within the audience, leading to widespread online speculation. Smith had posted the clip, captioned, "My favorite part of tour is seeing you all up close," prompting critics to question the authenticity of the footage. This incident has ignited debate about the use of AI in entertainment and the potential for misleading digital content.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that focusing on China's fundamental "needs" rather than its perceived "wants" is essential for de-escalating the US-China rivalry and fostering global stability. It argues that Beijing's foreign policy and domestic actions are primarily driven by critical internal constraints, such as maintaining economic growth, ensuring food and energy security, and preserving social order, which are paramount for the Communist Party's legitimacy. The article highlights that slowing economic growth and significant energy reliance motivate China's push for indigenous innovation and diversified supply chains. This "needs-first" perspective could offer deeper insights into China's vulnerabilities and provide avenues for more effective international diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Armagh musician Martin Rafferty from Northern Ireland has successfully broken the Guinness World Record for the longest busk, performing continuously for over 24 hours. This impressive feat was made even more remarkable as Rafferty accomplished it despite having a broken thumb, enduring challenging conditions, particularly during the cold early morning hours. He has expressed intentions to continue playing for a total of 30 hours, aiming to significantly exceed both the official and unofficial records. The "buskathon," held in Armagh's Market Street, also serves as a fundraiser for a local Christmas toy appeal, showcasing a remarkable blend of personal resilience and community support.</p>

          <p>Tennis player Daniil Medvedev received a $42,500 fine from the US Open for unsportsmanlike conduct and racket abuse during his first-round match. The incident unfolded after the chair umpire awarded his opponent, Benjamin Bonzi, an additional first serve due to a photographer's disruption at match point. Medvedev, who was the 2021 US Open champion, reacted with intense frustration, repeatedly striking his racket against his chair and engaging in a verbal altercation with the umpire, which further agitated the crowd. This substantial fine highlights the tournament's strict stance on player behavior.</p>

          <p>Botswana has achieved a remarkable public health triumph, reducing its childhood HIV infection rate by over 98% since the 1990s, effectively eliminating mother-to-child transmissions. Once grappling with an epidemic that saw one in eight infants infected, the nation established robust prevention infrastructure, offering free antiretroviral therapies and comprehensive prenatal and maternal care. This sustained political commitment and domestic investment enabled Botswana to become the first country with a high HIV prevalence to attain the World Health Organization's Gold Tier status for eradicating vertical transmissions. Its success now serves as a vital blueprint for other African nations, demonstrating that an AIDS-free generation is an achievable goal.</p>

          <p>The new movie "Splitsville" examines the profound cultural anxieties surrounding romantic commitment and the pursuit of self-discovery within contemporary relationships. The film opens with a dramatic car crash and a revelation of infidelity, setting the stage for a couple's chaotic venture into nonmonogamy. This article explores how the movie mirrors humanity's fundamental struggle between the needs for security and freedom, a psychological dichotomy highlighted by psychotherapist Esther Perel. It suggests that the modern illusion of boundless romantic choices, intensified by dating apps, often results in perpetual dissatisfaction as individuals constantly seek what their current partners cannot provide.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, is scheduled to visit the UK in September for a charity event, marking his first return since his appeal for police protection was denied. He will participate in the WellChild Awards, an event celebrating children with serious illnesses, where he will present an award and give a speech, maintaining his long-standing patronage. This brief visit sparks speculation about a possible meeting with King Charles, following recent reports of reconciliation efforts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rigorous new study from Stanford economists indicates that generative artificial intelligence is having a significant and disproportionate impact on entry-level workers in the US job market. Since 2022, early-career employees, aged 22 to 25, in fields highly exposed to AI such as software engineering and customer service, have experienced a 13% decline in employment. In contrast, more experienced workers in the same sectors and individuals in less AI-exposed occupations have maintained or increased their employment. The research suggests AI excels at "codified knowledge" but is less capable of replicating the "tacit knowledge" and soft skills acquired through years of practical experience, necessitating career adaptation.</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has unveiled the initial electric vehicle (EV) models that qualify for a substantial £3,750 discount under a new government grant scheme. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among those receiving the maximum reduction, while 26 other models are eligible for a £1,500 discount. This £650 million scheme, spanning three years, aims to significantly lower the upfront cost of EVs, making them more competitive with petrol and diesel counterparts, and thereby accelerate adoption ahead of the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales. The initiative seeks to overcome a key barrier for consumers, despite ongoing concerns about charging infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

Net income for the period reached $381 million, or $4.71 per share. This revised outlook accounts for current tariffs, which the company has managed through targeted price adjustments.

The proposed changes would allow for an average of 182 days let over multiple years, and permit up to 14 days of charity donations to count towards this target. This initiative responds to widespread criticism that the existing 182-day rule is detrimentally affecting the tourism sector and imposing undue financial pressure on businesses.
