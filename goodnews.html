          <h2>Weight Loss and Diabetes Drugs: Understanding Potential Mood Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 05:00:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the potential mood changes associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists, medications used for weight loss and diabetes management. While some studies suggest a link between these drugs and mental health complications like anxiety and depression, others attribute mood changes to genetic variations or the emotional impact of obesity and type 2 diabetes itself. Doctors emphasize the importance of monitoring patients for mood changes and taking a holistic approach to weight loss, offering mental health support alongside medication. They also stress that weight loss can positively impact mood, self-esteem, and overall well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the short-lived implementation of President Trump's aggressive tariff policies, dubbed "liberation day," which involved a blanket 10% tariff on all imports and higher rates on specific countries. The measures triggered global market instability and drew criticism from business leaders. After just 40 days, Trump reversed course, pausing the tariffs and making exemptions for certain goods, particularly those from China. The episode highlighted the administration's inconsistent trade strategy and raised concerns about the economic impact of tariffs on consumers and businesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's proposed "one big, beautiful bill" and Ronald Reagan's ambitious budget reconciliation in 1981, known as Reaganomics. Both initiatives aimed to reshape federal fiscal policy through tax cuts and increased military spending, utilizing the budget reconciliation process to bypass filibusters in the Senate. Reagan's program promised economic stimulus through tax cuts, while Trump's includes similar tax and spending cuts, alongside policy directives. The article also highlights the role of unelected officials, such as Elon Musk in Trump's administration and David Stockman in Reagan's, in driving these significant policy changes.</p>

          <p>After a quarter-century drought, the New York Knicks have reached the Eastern Conference finals, marking a significant transformation from a struggling franchise to a legitimate title contender. A series of strategic trades and free-agent signings by President Leon Rose has reshaped the team, culminating in a roster that is now challenging for the championship.

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with the police investigating the theft. Locals suspect the statue was either vandalized or melted down for cash, but do not believe the disappearance was politically motivated. The statue, which replaced a wooden version that was previously set on fire, had been criticized for its unesthetic appearance and failure to capture the likeness of the former first lady. The statue's disappearance has not been met with widespread mourning in Sevnica, which has otherwise capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, finding that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The findings also indicate that early settlers split into groups isolated in different environmental settings, providing a new genetic and cultural understanding of present-day South American communities.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a "flexible approach" in courting Taiwan's remaining allies, as evidenced by the attendance of delegations from Haiti and St Lucia at a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, these countries participated in the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum, underscoring Beijing's efforts to exert diplomatic pressure on Taipei.
