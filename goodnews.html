          <p>In a recent interview, President Trump stated that he was unsure if he was obligated to uphold the Constitution, deferring to his lawyers' interpretation of the law. He also mentioned that he would not seek a third term, despite previous teases about the possibility. Additionally, Trump indicated that he would not fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell before his term concludes in 2026. This article highlights the president's ambiguous stance on fundamental aspects of his role and responsibilities within the U.S. government.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About Over-Reliance on Egg Freezing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:05:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed path to motherhood, highlighting its high costs and uncertain outcomes. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center emphasizes that egg freezing is a gamble with risks at multiple stages, including the thawing process, fertilization, and implantation. The financial burden, with costs upwards of $12,000 per cycle plus storage fees, further complicates the decision. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, critics argue this could be to retain female employees rather than support their family planning choices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly viewed as a way for women to extend their reproductive years and make family planning decisions on their own terms. The number of egg freezing procedures has significantly increased in recent years, with many women seeing it as a way to avoid rushing into partnerships or feeling pressured by their biological clocks. While acknowledging it is not a guarantee, women who have chosen to freeze their eggs emphasize the importance of education and open conversations about fertility options. Doctors also note the increasing trend of younger women freezing their eggs to preserve their options for the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Egg freezing is gaining traction as a method for women to preserve their fertility, involving hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. The process can cost between $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, with additional storage and fertilization fees. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, many women pay out of pocket, viewing it as an investment in their future reproductive options. Experts emphasize that egg quality decreases with age, making the 20s an optimal time to freeze eggs, and highlight the importance of considering the procedure's costs and limitations.</p>

          <p>A recent report by Savills indicates that over half of first-time homebuyers in the past year received financial assistance from family members, averaging around ¬£55,572 in loans or gifts. This trend is attributed to high mortgage rates and rising rental costs, which have made it challenging for young buyers to enter the housing market. Despite a slight decrease from the previous year, family support remains a crucial factor for many first-time buyers seeking to secure better mortgage deals amidst tough lending criteria.</p>
