          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched a new feature called "study mode" within ChatGPT, designed to assist students by guiding them through problems step-by-step rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address educators' concerns about AI being used for cheating and to encourage critical thinking among its large student user base. When using study mode, students will receive guiding questions for homework, test preparation, and learning new subjects. The feature will be available for most ChatGPT users and will soon be integrated into ChatGPT Edu, the version designed specifically for universities, as part of OpenAI's effort to improve learning with AI.</p>

          <h2>French Beach Town Imposes Fines for Inappropriate Attire to Maintain Respect and Hygiene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:51:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The French seaside resort of Les Sables-d’Olonne is enforcing a ban on tourists wearing only swimwear in the town center, imposing fines up to $175 for violations. The town's mayor stated the rule is a matter of respect for local residents and basic hygiene in public spaces like shops and markets. This crackdown is part of a broader trend of vacation destinations addressing issues related to overtourism and tourist behavior. The campaign, under the slogan "respect doesn’t go on holiday," clarifies that swimwear is appropriate on the town's extensive beaches but not within the main town area itself.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, a move that would solidify its position as the largest U.S. credit card issuer. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the high-growth but financially challenging consumer card business would mark the end of a difficult chapter. The partnership had faced regulatory scrutiny and concerns over potential loan losses. For Apple, a deal with the more experienced JPMorgan could bring greater stability to its credit card operations after a period of rapid expansion under Goldman's management. The transition would represent a significant shift in the consumer finance landscape.</p>

          <p>A Welsh zoo has announced the birth of four rare Sumatran tiger cubs, marking the largest litter born in the UK and offering new hope for the critically endangered species. The cubs, born at Manor House Wildlife Park, are part of a European breeding program designed to maintain genetic diversity among the tiger population, of which fewer than 400 remain in the wild. Officials at the park kept the news private for six weeks to allow the cubs to settle in with their mother. These cubs will eventually join the global breeding program to help secure the future of their species.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers suggest that recent expansions to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) could make building affordable housing more profitable, potentially helping to address the severe housing shortage in the U.S. A recently passed bill increased the amount of available credits and lowered financing requirements, which is expected to help produce or preserve over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite this support, developers still face challenges from high interest rates, construction costs, and local opposition (NIMBYism). The article notes that while investor interest in the affordable housing space is growing, proposed cuts to federal rental assistance could create new obstacles.</p>

The podcast, known for its deeply personal and revealing conversations with celebrities and public figures, has been a significant part of Maron's life and career. While he believes it's the right time to stop, he acknowledges the challenge of moving on from the nourishing, real-time connections the show provided and the need to expand his social life outside the studio.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning American singer Ciara has become a citizen of Benin under a new law that offers nationality to the descendants of people taken from Africa during the transatlantic slave trade. The West African nation enacted the law as part of an initiative to strengthen ties with the African diaspora and promote cultural tourism. Ciara's citizenship ceremony took place in the city of Cotonou, with the government calling it a symbolic and historic gesture of extending a hand to those torn from the land by history. Benin joins other countries like Ghana in creating a pathway to citizenship for descendants of enslaved Africans.</p>

          <p>A painting purchased for just £150 at a house clearance in Cambridge has been authenticated as an original work by Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and is now expected to sell for up to £30,000. The piece, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' was part of a series illustrating 'The Arabian Nights' that Dalí was commissioned to create in the 1960s. An anonymous art dealer who bought the work discovered it had been previously attributed to Dalí at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s before its attribution was lost. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dalí scholars and highlights the potential for finding hidden treasures.</p>

Trump appeared to make headway with Starmer on increasing humanitarian aid to Gaza and signaled a shorter deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire.

          <p>A review of Eloghosa Osunde's novel 'Necessary Fiction' highlights its exploration of chosen families among queer Nigerian characters who feel alienated from their biological kin. The novel presents kinship not as an inherited obligation but as an act of sustained intention, a theme that resonates in a world of increasing isolation. The article draws a parallel to the television show 'Pose,' arguing that both works offer a vision of how meaningful connections can be forged. By focusing on the creation and affirmation of these bonds, the novel provides a model of kinship that could be a remedy for the modern "loneliness epidemic."</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, partly due to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and a surge in U.S. imports as firms rushed to beat new taxes.

The report noted that a modest, albeit fragile, decrease in trade tensions has contributed to global economic resilience. However, the IMF warned that the boost from import "front-loading" will likely fade and that persistent uncertainty could still lead to weaker growth. (not investment advice)</p>
