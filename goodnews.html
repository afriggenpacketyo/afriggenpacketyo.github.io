          <p>This article discusses three insurance policies that seniors should consider this spring to enhance their financial protection. Medicare supplemental insurance can cover co-pays and deductibles not covered by traditional Medicare. Long-term care insurance can help with costs associated with nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides a payout to beneficiaries after death. The article advises seniors to research their options and secure coverage sooner rather than later, as prices generally increase with age. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban fluoride in tap water, a move signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis. The law prohibits local governments from adding fluoride to water systems, citing concerns about overexposure. This decision contrasts with the views of dentists and public health advocates, who consider water fluoridation a safe and effective way to maintain dental health. Miami-Dade County had already voted to remove fluoride from its water ahead of the statewide ban, sparking controversy over potential long-term health consequences, as this article highlights the debate surrounding the new law.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The research suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The study also found that early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to the development of distinct genetic traits. Researchers believe the new genetic data shows natural barriers, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Andes mountain range, led to the isolation of these Indigenous groups.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told lawmakers that the FAA has resorted to buying replacement parts on eBay and using 3D printers due to the agency's aging air traffic control system. Duffy stated that the FAA is trying to replace hundreds of radars and build new control towers to overhaul the system. The FAA has not cut any air traffic controllers, and the layoffs and voluntary buyouts that hit the federal workforce earlier this year excluded safety positions.

          <p>The Supreme Court is reviewing the White House's effort to overturn birthright citizenship, a right enshrined in the Constitution since the 1800s. President Trump has used questions about citizenship to power his political rise, often arguing that birthright citizenship encourages immigration and exhausts local resources. The issue before the court is whether federal judges have the power to block presidential actions through nationwide injunctions. A ruling in Trump's favor could allow him to implement his order ending automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and certain foreign residents.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that the U.S. could face an increase in supply shocks, a week after the central bank held interest rates steady. He suggested that higher real rates could unleash greater inflation volatility. Analysts have also warned that U.S. companies could face inventory shortfalls due to tariff-induced supply chain issues. Powell acknowledged that the economic environment has changed since the Fed's last strategy meeting in 2020, and the central bank is weighing the economic risks posed by the Trump administration's tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will revisit the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children, citing potential health risks. This decision aligns with a wave of bills restricting fluoride use, including bans in Utah and Florida. The FDA will review the safety of these products by October 31, despite concerns from dentists and researchers who believe the evidence supporting the move is weak. The agency cited concerns about the gut microbiome, I.Q. levels, and thyroid issues.</p>

          <p>A second air traffic control facility in Colorado experienced a communications outage after a series of disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. The 90-second outage occurred after another facility in Philadelphia had two radar outages. Controllers in Colorado used another frequency to relay instructions to pilots, and the FAA is investigating. Federal officials have downplayed the consequences of the outages, while working to install a third fiber-optic line at the Philadelphia facility and make other upgrades.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration is planning to revisit its approval of the food additive ADA (azodicarbonamide), which is used to whiten cereal flour and improve baking bread dough. This announcement comes after concerns over its safety and the fact that it is banned in Europe due to the potential formation of a possible carcinogen. The agency will also review the safety of other ingredients, including BHT and BHA, which have faced similar concerns. The FDA plans to implement a modernized, evidence-based prioritization scheme for reviewing chemicals in the food supply.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court pressed an attorney for the federal government on how President Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship would be implemented amid legal challenges. The justices questioned the ability of district judges to block a president's policies nationwide. Concerns were raised about the practicalities of implementing a policy denying citizenship at birth, and the government's timeline to develop such a policy. The case is a test of district judges' power to block a president's policies nationwide.</p>
