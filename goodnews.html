          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska discusses her experiences navigating Washington D.C.'s political landscape in her new memoir, "Far from Home." Murkowski, a third-generation Alaskan, emphasizes her commitment to her constituents and her independent approach to politics, noting that she was re-elected through the support of Alaskans across party lines after losing in the Republican primary. She highlights her dedication to representing the diverse needs of her state and expresses concern over Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, regardless of the president's party. She stresses the importance of maintaining relationships to effectively serve Alaska, even with those she disagrees with. The senator did not vote for Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is projected to experience historically low results in the Tokyo assembly election, signaling challenges for his minority government ahead of the House of Councillors race. Yuriko Koike's regional party, Tomin First no Kai, is expected to gain prominence, emphasizing policies focused on quality of life. The election results are viewed as a reflection of voter sentiment on national issues, including inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. Shinji Inoue, head of the LDP's Tokyo chapter, acknowledged the party's failure to effectively communicate its message regarding price hikes. </p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher after the United States struck key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on the expectation that Washington's involvement would lead to a resolution of the conflict, despite Iranian rhetoric. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain gained. Egypt's EGX30 saw a significant increase. Analysts suggest that the Gulf markets have distanced themselves from the conflict, supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped isolate them from significant market impact.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reem Raouda, a conscious parenting expert, identifies five common phrases that can make children resistant to listening and suggests alternative approaches to foster cooperation. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Raouda argues that these phrases trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while alternatives that respect a child's autonomy and acknowledge their feelings promote a more positive and collaborative dynamic. She emphasizes that the key to getting kids to listen is creating conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>
