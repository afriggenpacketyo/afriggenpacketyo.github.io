Watkins, a two-time Wooden Award winner and AP Player of the Year, stated her focus is on healing to return to the game she loves. Her absence is a significant blow to USC's title hopes, though the arrival of top prospect Jazzy Davidson is expected to help fill some of the void.

          <p>This article discusses 'energy vampires' in friendships—individuals who drain one's energy through excessive complaining, self-focus, or lack of interest in others. Psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani identify signs like an excessive need for attention and subtle mood-chipping. They suggest strategies for handling such friendships, including honest conversations about feeling unheard, setting clear boundaries on time or topics, and changing shared activities to reduce dominance. The goal is to protect one's well-being while potentially maintaining the relationship.</p>

          <p>CM Energy's president, Wang Yongxin, highlighted the critical need for Hong Kong to establish a robust supply chain for green methanol to meet its sustainable marine fuel targets. While Hong Kong has achieved liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a reliable upstream-to-downstream system, including tax-free mainland-produced fuel. The company's new dual-fuel vehicle carrier, CM Hong Kong, currently uses one-quarter green methanol, despite its higher cost, anticipating increased usage from 2027 due to European carbon emission tariffs.</p>

          <p>Tutu Atwell, a diminutive Rams receiver, dramatically sealed a 27-20 comeback victory over the Indianapolis Colts with an 88-yard touchdown catch from Matthew Stafford.

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, known for its windmills, plans to charge tourists a €17.50 entry fee starting next spring to manage overcrowding. With 2.6 million visitors annually—a massive number for its 100 residents—the influx has led to privacy issues, with tourists entering gardens and houses. The fee, which includes museum and windmill access, aims to reduce numbers and fund maintenance and infrastructure. Local businesses, however, fear a significant loss of shoppers due to the increased cost for visitors.</p>
