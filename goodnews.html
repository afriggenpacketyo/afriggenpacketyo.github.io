          <p>Hundreds of items owned by the late filmmaker David Lynch were sold at an estate auction in Beverly Hills, an event described as "Lynchian." The auction featured a mix of the mundane and the macabre, mirroring the stylistic undercurrents of Lynch's films. Attendees included filmmakers, actors, cinephiles, and woodworkers, all drawn by the opportunity to connect with Lynch's energy. Big-ticket items like screenplays sold for high prices, but many attendees sought items representing lesser-known aspects of Lynch's artistic output, like espresso machines and woodworking tools. The auction served as both a sale of possessions and a reflective, celebratory wake for the beloved artist.</p>

          <p>Doug Schoen, drawing on his experience advising the State Department on Serbia, argues that President Trump's strikes on Iran could ignite regime change. He draws parallels between the situation in Iran and the downfall of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia, noting widespread anger towards the government due to economic mismanagement. Schoen cites polling data indicating dissatisfaction among Iranians, particularly the youth, and points to numerous protest movements against the regime since 2009. He acknowledges the risks of encouraging regime change but believes the Iranian government is weaker than it appears, with a well-organized opposition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese state media is advocating for Beijing to proactively adopt yuan-backed stablecoins to facilitate the internationalization of the yuan. The article in Securities Times warns that delaying the development of such stablecoins could mean missing a golden opportunity, especially as the US has a head start. While unregulated stablecoins could harm the financial system, they also offer an efficient settlement tool for cross-border transactions. The article suggests that regulating stablecoins and promoting the yuan's global use might be a better solution for China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers have voluntarily agreed to streamline and reduce prior authorizations, a process that often causes delays and administrative burdens for patients and providers. Plans under insurers like CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna will implement changes to connect patients to care more quickly and reduce administrative burdens. Efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic prior authorization requests by 2027 and reducing the types of claims subject to prior authorization requests by 2026. The changes aim to benefit 257 million Americans and build on existing efforts to simplify processes.</p>

The article emphasizes the importance of prompt tick removal, careful checks, and using repellents to reduce the risk of infection. It provides guidance from CDC experts on how to stay safe, including treating clothing with permethrin and using EPA-registered insect repellents.

          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the war between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely shrugged off the escalation, with many strategists believing the conflict to be contained. The MSCI World index saw only a slight decrease, and European shares recovered early losses. Safe-haven assets also showed a muted response, with the yield on the 10-year note gaining slightly and spot gold shedding value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. dollar experienced a surge in early trading following the U.S. military strikes on Iran, driven by its traditional safe-haven status. However, analysts warn that these gains may be temporary due to underlying concerns about U.S. fiscal policy, trade wars, and weakening international demand for U.S. assets. While fears of a Strait of Hormuz closure initially boosted the dollar, analysts suggest that Iran may use asymmetric capabilities to raise the economic cost of combined US/Israeli operations. Concerns about U.S. import tariffs and heavy investor bets on the dollar's decline further contribute to the potential for a short-lived rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have discovered evidence that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may impact the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The scientists monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. They observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors induced by muons, separating the contributions of muons and gamma rays. These findings could be significant for scaling quantum processors and designing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>

While Japan traditionally maintains amicable ties with Iran, its security alliance with the U.S. remains strong. The government continues to monitor the impact of the conflict on Japan's energy supply, particularly regarding the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz.
