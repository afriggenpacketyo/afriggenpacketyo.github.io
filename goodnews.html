          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at lowering energy costs for businesses and stimulating economic growth. A key component is the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green energy levies. The strategy also includes measures to expedite grid connections for new factories, upskill British workers, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has hailed the plan as a turning point for Britain's economy, supporting key industries and creating over one million new jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a ketamine clinic at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy. This follows the opening of a private clinic offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The aim is to provide an additional option for patients who do not respond well to traditional treatments, although caution is advised due to potential risks associated with ketamine misuse.</p>

The MSCI World index saw only a slight decline, and safe havens traded mixed, indicating a limited market reaction. Analysts suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, diminishing the immediate nuclear threat. Traders are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, but the overall impact on global markets is not seen as a systemic risk.

The goal of spending 5% of GDP on defense is highly ambitious and could transform societies in Europe. While some countries are hesitant, the alliance is trying to balance these concerns with the need to present a united front against potential threats, with the summit deliberately planned as a brief exchange to not bore Trump.</p>

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support, but it also presents challenges in terms of transparency and predictability. Preliminary results based on first-choice votes will be available shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will not begin until July 1. The computerized process could lead to unexpected outcomes, potentially causing some candidates who initially lead to lose due to lack of second or third-choice votes.</p>
