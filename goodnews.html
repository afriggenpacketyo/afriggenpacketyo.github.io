          <p>An article in the People's Liberation Army Daily discusses the potential advantages of humanoid robots in future warfare, noting their tactical flexibility and strategic deterrence. The commentary references China's Tien Kung Ultra robot, which excelled in a half-marathon, as evidence of the bipedal design's ability to navigate complex environments. The article also mentions a Russian robot capable of shooting guns, highlighting the global interest in robotic military applications. This suggests that China is actively exploring the integration of advanced robotics into its military strategy, viewing it as a key component of modern warfare.</p>

The couple had been convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of millions of dollars and evading taxes, with their sentences later reduced after their initial sentencing. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, expressed gratitude and shock at the pardon, stating that it "literally came out of nowhere."

          <p>Global financial markets responded favorably to a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, causing U.S. futures to jump and oil prices to rise. The court found that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not authorize the use of tariffs. Although the White House appealed the ruling, investors took heart after months of turmoil caused by Trump's trade war. The ruling also pushed the dollar sharply higher against the Japanese yen, while stock markets in Asia and Europe saw gains. (not investment advice)</p>

Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Ben Youngs, and Alex Goode, all of whom started in England's shocking victory over New Zealand in 2012, are retiring from English rugby in the coming days and weeks. Danny Care, who was on the bench that day, is also bowing out, all of whom have given a huge amount to the English game. Care cited the mid-season retirements of generational players Joe Marler and Anthony Watson as well, noting the rise of academy players in the sport.</p>
