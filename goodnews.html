The upgrade, part of a quarterly reshuffling at the London Stock Exchange Group, comes as the brand regains traction. Schulman's turnaround plans have shown early signs of success, with the company reporting a better-than-feared decline in first-quarter sales. Burberry's share price had fallen sharply in recent years, but cost-cutting measures are expected to deliver significant savings by 2026. The optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>US flight attendants are advocating for boarding wages following a tentative deal between Air Canada and its flight attendants, which includes pay during boarding and unboarding of flights. The Air Canada strike has put pressure on management everywhere to get real in negotiations, according to the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. Airline employees in the US are covered under the Railway Labor Act, which doesn’t mandate direct hourly pay. Delta Air Lines became the first big carrier to change this in 2022.

          <p>Taylor Swift's success is attributed to her ability to saturate sugary tunes with information, creating a storytelling medium that engages listeners on both an emotional and intellectual level. Her songs interlock with other tracks and extramusical artifacts, building a larger narrative that enhances the enjoyment of each individual work. Her adventuresome approach to genre has helped her write ever richer chapters, reflecting the anxieties of her 30s. Swift's greatest legacy is overhauling pop into a vital, contemporary storytelling medium. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>A Knoxville man quit his job and moved into a trailer to save money while in school, but Dave Ramsey isn't sold on his plan.

Income is important, but financial habits also play a crucial role in financial success. Given the man's situation, pursuing IT training and developing strong financial habits are key steps towards financial stability. (not investment advice) The optimism score is 65.</p>
