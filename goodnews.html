          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' the first Kannada language book to win the award. Translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, the stories capture the hardships of Muslim women in southern India. Mushtaq's work reflects challenges faced by women due to religious conservatism and patriarchal society, focusing on lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist. The win is expected to encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients with six months or less to live. The law, effective next year, allows mentally capable adults to request a prescription to end their lives, making Delaware the 11th state to permit medical aid in dying. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options and undergo two waiting periods and a second medical opinion before obtaining the prescription. Supporters argue the law is about compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after commenting that he "never had to buy rice" because he received it as gifts, sparking public anger amid high rice prices.

          <p>Taku Eto resigned as Japan's farm minister after facing criticism for saying he doesn't buy rice due to receiving it from supporters, a remark seen as insensitive amid rising rice prices.

Research indicates that while there is a gender gap in political support, it is due to a sharp leftward shift among young women. The author suggests that center-left parties should prioritize the values of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, to transform the political debate and mobilize young women to vote.</p>
