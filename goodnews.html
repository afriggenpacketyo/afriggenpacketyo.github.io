          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump, is refusing the pardon she received for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, stating that the pardons contribute to a false narrative. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes that those involved were guilty and that the pardons are being used to perpetuate a false narrative about the Justice Department being weaponized. She worked with Senator James Risch to formally acknowledge her non-acceptance of the pardon with the Department of Justice. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other January 6 defendants who have actively sought and utilized their pardons.</p>

The association argued that the list of ‚Äúnoncompliant‚Äù sheriffs could damage the relationship between the Trump administration and law enforcement. The DHS had published the list, deeming the areas included as having a policy of limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, as prompted by an executive order from President Trump. Leaders of some cities publicly questioned the sanctuary label, with immigrant advocates arguing that sanctuary policies help build trust between communities and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a multitrillion-dollar tax and spending package, including President Trump's priorities, but experts anticipate changes in the Senate. The House bill would make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and add new tax breaks, while also cutting spending for low-income programs. Policy experts expect debate over the Medicaid provision and other changes. The Senate's version is not expected to differ drastically, but negotiations are anticipated.</p>

          <p>Advisers to President Trump are defending the administration's tariff policies amid legal challenges, insisting that they are "not going away." A federal court had ruled that Trump overstepped his authority in imposing the tariffs, but the administration is appealing the ruling. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that tariffs are a key tenet of Trump's policy agenda, while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would back the tariffs. If the tariffs are blocked, Hassett said the administration would pursue alternative ways to ensure fair trade.</p>
