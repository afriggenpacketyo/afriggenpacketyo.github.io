          <p>With average credit card debt balances around $8,000 and cumulative balances exceeding $1 trillion, June presents a crucial opportunity for borrowers to address their debt. Elevated interest rates and lingering inflation make it imperative to tackle credit card debt before it escalates further. Viable debt relief options include balance transfer credit cards, debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and credit card debt forgiveness. Borrowers should carefully evaluate their financial situation to determine the most suitable strategy for permanently reducing their credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine executed a complex and daring operation, dubbed "Spider Web," targeting Russian air bases with over 100 drones, some of which hit nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The drones were smuggled into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries and launched remotely, striking locations as far as 8,000km from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the operation took one year, six months, and nine days to prepare, resulting in significant losses for Russia. The attack demonstrates Ukraine's evolving capabilities in drone warfare and its strategic focus on degrading Russia's military assets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential interest rate cuts looming, opening a $10,000 long-term certificate of deposit (CD) this June could be a wise financial move. The Federal Reserve's rate cut campaign, paused in the first half of 2025, may resume soon, reducing CD rates. A long-term CD protects against market volatility with fixed interest rates, ensuring steady interest accumulation regardless of market changes. Savers can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest, making it a simple and safe way to grow their money while avoiding market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
