          <p>Research teams in China have made notable advancements in optical chip technology, which uses light instead of electrons for data transfer, potentially accelerating the development of powerful artificial intelligence. One recent development, known as Meteor-1, reportedly demonstrates a hundred-fold increase in computability by utilizing a high number of light channels for parallel processing. While some experts note the underlying theories are not new, the hardware implementation represents a significant engineering achievement that could help overcome the physical limitations of traditional electronic chips.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to release the first part of its final report, focusing on the human toll and victim compensation. The scandal saw thousands of sub-postmasters wrongly accused of theft due to a faulty IT system called Horizon, leading to wrongful prosecutions, financial ruin, and imprisonment for many. While this report is expected to be damning about the victims' treatment, the section assigning blame for the miscarriage of justice will not be published until a later date. Victims hope the findings will accelerate the process for full and fair compensation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual harassment or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render such confidentiality clauses void, a move Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated is necessary to "stamp this practice out." The reform follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, a former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, who broke her own NDA. The change aims to ensure that inappropriate workplace behavior is addressed openly rather than concealed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has abruptly reversed its recent decision to halt weapons shipments to Ukraine, announcing that it will send additional defensive arms. President Trump stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself against the intense attacks it is currently facing. The sudden U-turn, which came just days after the initial halt, has been described as a victory for common sense, though it has also created confusion and embarrassed the Pentagon. The move provides critical, albeit unpredictable, support for Ukraine's defense efforts amid ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister, Boris Pistorius, has put forward a draft bill that would allow the government to reactivate military conscription in specific emergency security situations. The plan is a compromise, aiming to rapidly boost armed forces if needed without fully reinstating compulsory service, which was suspended in 2011. The proposal also seeks to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay to increase the number of active soldiers and reservists. This initiative is part of Germany's response to the changed security landscape in Europe following Russia's aggression.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia has surprised markets by holding its key interest rate at 3.85%, defying economists' expectations of a cut. The central bank stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its target, noting that recent monthly data was slightly stronger than anticipated. This decision comes as Australia's economy faces a growth slowdown, and the move was met with disappointment by government officials hoping for relief for consumers. Analysts now suggest a rate cut may come in August after more comprehensive inflation data is available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is forecast to experience its third heatwave of the summer later this week, with predictions that it will be the most sustained and widespread one yet. A high-pressure system is expected to draw hot air from continental Europe, pushing temperatures to a peak of 33°C (91°F) in England over the weekend. Unlike previous heatwaves focused on the south, this event will bring hot weather to Wales, Northern Ireland, and Scotland as well. High UV and pollen levels are also anticipated, with some areas potentially meeting heatwave criteria for seven consecutive days.</p>

This new medicine, Coartem Baby, was developed by Novartis and the Medicines for Malaria Venture and is expected to be rolled out in African countries within weeks.
