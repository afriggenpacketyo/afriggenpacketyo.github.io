          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri on his final lap. The qualifying session at Silverstone was highly competitive, with Piastri's teammate Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell fourth, setting the stage for a thrilling race. Verstappen noted the challenging windy conditions and the team's choice of a low-downforce setup, which made the car fast on straights but difficult in high-speed corners. The close margins between the top drivers suggest a competitive fight for the win.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued what it describes as a "positive response" to the most recent ceasefire proposal mediated by the United States, indicating a willingness to enter negotiations to implement the framework. The proposal reportedly involves a 60-day truce, though Hamas is still seeking guarantees for a complete end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. President Trump expressed optimism about the development, suggesting a deal could be reached within the next week. The potential breakthrough comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit Washington for further discussions.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on social media, with proponents claiming the mixture of coconut water, juices, magnesium, and salt can lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical of these claims, stating there is no scientific evidence that the drink's ingredients can directly impact cortisol levels. Doctors note that cortisol is a necessary hormone and that managing stress is more complex than a single beverage. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, they recommend proven stress-reduction techniques like quality sleep and exercise instead.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the "MingKwai" Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered, exciting scholars of technology and language. The machine was a groundbreaking attempt to adapt the complex, character-based Chinese language to a mechanical keyboard, a significant challenge that had to be overcome for modern computing in China. The typewriter's ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input methods. The rediscovered artifact is now at Stanford University, offering new insights into the globalization of technology.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over a century, Parisians are legally allowed to swim in the River Seine, following a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project. The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted with the opening of designated and monitored swimming areas in the heart of the city. Officials, including Mayor Anne Hidalgo, have confirmed that the water quality now meets safety standards on most days, marking the fulfillment of a long-held dream. The reopening was met with enthusiasm from residents, eager to cool off in the iconic waterway amid high summer temperatures.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are working to reshape the public's negative perception of sharks while gathering vital data on ocean health. By studying hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay, the research team examines stomach contents to understand the animals' diet, health, and the overall quality of the marine ecosystem. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the lab's work emphasizes that healthy shark populations are indicative of a healthy ocean. Despite public fascination with sharks, researchers say securing financial support for the crucial conservation science remains a significant challenge.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage negative emotions like anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a rush of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued feeling of anger is a choice made by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat advises using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to respond, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, thereby gaining control over one's mental state.</p>

          <p>An Emory University professor shares her year-long experiment of trying 17 different hobbies, inspired by the Danish culture's emphasis on personal pursuits outside of work. She found that dedicating time to activities like tennis, woodworking, and mahjong fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit and feel less lonely. The experience reshaped her definition of self-care from passive appointments to active, skill-building engagement. She argues that hobbies are the secret to achieving balance, forcing individuals to set boundaries and build identities and communities outside of their professional lives.</p>

          <p>Florida was the most popular state for retirees in 2023, attracting a net influx of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older, according to a new analysis of census data. The state's appeal is often attributed to its sunny weather and tax-friendly policies, including no state income tax on Social Security benefits or retirement account withdrawals. Following Florida, North Carolina and Arizona were the next most popular destinations. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees, with a net loss of nearly 57,000 people in the same age group. (not investment advice)</p>
