        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule," which allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions. This rule gained renewed attention during the Trump administration's tariff regime, enabling companies to reduce costs, particularly in higher-value consumer goods and luxury products. The criteria for applying the rule include at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, sales carried out at arm's length by independent parties, proof that the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price. Moncler, an Italian luxury fashion brand, has flagged the first sale rule as providing "significant benefit" to its cost structure.</p>

          <p>China is set to receive the world's first ship dedicated to salmon farming, named Su Hai No 1, in June, marking a significant step in the country's efforts to enhance its seafood supply through offshore aquaculture. Built by Huangpu Wenchong Shipyard at a cost of $83.6 million, the vessel is expected to produce up to 8,000 tonnes of salmon annually. Unlike traditional offshore net-pen systems, the Su Hai No 1 can quickly relocate to safer waters to avoid adverse conditions and features an onboard processing facility for rapid delivery to domestic markets, reducing reliance on imported chilled salmon. This initiative aligns with Beijing's emphasis on developing the ocean economy and strengthening food security amid global climate change and geopolitical tensions.</p>

Tencent president Martin Lau mentioned the company's substantial stockpile of GPUs and its ability to achieve strong AI training results with a smaller number of chips. Baidu is emphasizing its "full-stack" capabilities, combining cloud computing infrastructure, AI models, and applications to drive down costs and improve GPU utilization.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep helps the brain flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. Researchers discovered that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.</p>

Faust contends that democracy is once again under threat, assailed by autocratic leaders, and underscores the importance of upholding the principles for which Union soldiers gave their lives.

          <p>Wild chickens have become increasingly prevalent in Miami, inhabiting residential neighborhoods and even the downtown area, and are embraced by many as an unofficial mascot. These fowl are closely connected to the cultural heritage of people who have moved to Miami from rural areas of Cuba and Latin America. In Little Havana, fiberglass rooster statues were installed in 2002 to celebrate the area's culture, further solidifying the birds' symbolic status. While some worry about the impact of development and gentrification on the chicken population, residents like Donato Ramos Mart√≠nez appreciate their presence and consider them an integral part of the community.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to lower soaring prices, with the aim of reducing them to around 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move seeks to address public criticism over the government's perceived ineffectiveness in controlling rice prices amidst broader inflation. The government plans to release approximately 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system to exert greater influence over prices. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, partly due to a poor harvest.</p>

Tripadvisor employs a three-pronged process that relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews.

          <p>President Donald Trump asserted that United States Steel Corp. will remain under American control despite a "planned partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., which aims to acquire the company. Trump emphasized that the deal is structured as an investment and partial ownership, ensuring U.S. control, otherwise he would not approve it. Trump highlighted that the agreement will create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the economy, with the bulk of Nippon Steel's investment occurring over the next 14 months. The announcement follows a review by federal agencies, but specific details of the acquisition scheme remain undisclosed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that progress has been made in talks with Iran regarding its nuclear program and suggested an announcement could be forthcoming in the "next two days." He described the talks as "very, very good" and emphasized that "real progress, serious progress" had been made. This statement contrasts with the Omani mediator's assessment, who described the progress as "some but not conclusive." The discussions focus on curbing Iran's nuclear program in exchange for lifting some economic sanctions imposed by the U.S.</p>
