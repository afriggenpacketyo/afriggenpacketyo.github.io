        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated and ranked in new league tables based on performance across seven key areas, including waiting times, cancer treatment, and financial management. Specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital secured the top positions, while Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn was ranked at the bottom, partly due to structural issues with its buildings. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to increase transparency and accountability. However, some organizations have raised concerns that the metrics used may not accurately reflect the quality of patient care.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is expected to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo. Nuno was sacked after a 3-0 defeat to West Ham, despite having led the club to its highest Premier League finish in decades last season and securing European qualification. Postecoglou, who was recently let go by Tottenham Hotspur after a difficult league campaign, is seen as a strong candidate to take over at the City Ground. If appointed, he would become the eighth permanent manager under the club's current ownership since 2017.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks center Cameron Brink is establishing herself as a new kind of WNBA star, balancing a high-profile career with a focus on inclusivity and personal growth. After a significant ACL injury cut her rookie season short, Brink used the recovery time to explore interests outside of basketball, including art and co-hosting a podcast. Now back on the court, the 23-year-old is recognized by teammates for her intentional efforts to include everyone, a trait not always common for athletes of her status. Brink is also a vocal advocate for mental health and aims to use her platform for meaningful change.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Trump administration has taken a significant step toward making healthcare more affordable by making "copper plans" widely available on the Obamacare exchanges. Previously, these plans, which feature lower premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs, were restricted to individuals under 30 or those granted a rare hardship exemption. The administration has now expanded eligibility for this exemption, a move the author claims will save families thousands and encourage uninsured individuals, particularly younger and healthier ones, to get coverage, thereby stabilizing the insurance market.

          <p>A recent court ruling in a major US antitrust case against Google resulted in the company avoiding a forced break-up, a decision influenced by the rapid emergence of generative AI. The judge, Amit Mehta, noted in his opinion that AI chatbots have fundamentally changed the search engine market, introducing powerful new competitors and potentially disrupting Google's long-held dominance. While Google was found to have illegally monopolized the search market, the judge opted for less severe remedies, such as information sharing, acknowledging that the competitive landscape is already being reshaped by AI technology.</p>

          <p>A long-running succession dispute within the Murdoch family has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over the conservative media empire. Under the deal, Lachlan will control a new trust, while his siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with shares in Fox Corp and News Corp. The three siblings, who are more politically moderate, are expected to sell their holdings and receive approximately $1.1 billion each. This resolution ends all litigation and ensures the ongoing conservative direction of outlets like Fox News after founder Rupert Murdoch's death.</p>
