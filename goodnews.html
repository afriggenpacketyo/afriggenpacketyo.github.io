          <p>E.l.f. Beauty is set to acquire Rhode, Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, for up to $1 billion in a cash and stock deal, marking E.l.f.'s largest acquisition to date. The move aims to expand E.l.f.'s presence in the skincare market, leveraging Rhode's rapid growth and direct-to-consumer model. According to E.l.f. CEO Tarang Amin, Rhode achieved $212 million in net sales within three years with only ten products, a disruption that caught E.l.f.'s attention. The acquisition is expected to close in the second quarter of E.l.f.'s fiscal 2026, with plans to roll Rhode out into retail, including Sephora, to further support growth.</p>

          <p>Lincoln Center has announced a $335 million renovation plan for Damrosch Park, aiming to upgrade the aging site and better integrate it with the surrounding neighborhood. The project, largely funded by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation, includes repairing the leaky garage roof and constructing a new amphitheater to eliminate the costs of setting up a temporary stage each summer. The most significant aspect of the plan involves opening the park to the West Side community, addressing historical divisions created during urban renewal. The redesigned park will feature tiered gardens, a lawn, and a pool, reflecting community input and aiming to create a welcoming public space.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced gains after a U.S. court blocked President Trump's imposition of some tariffs, offering investors hope that a trade war could be averted. The S&P 500 index increased by 0.8% in early trading, with Nvidia's strong earnings report further boosting the market. Analysts suggest the court ruling reduces uncertainty regarding extreme and rapidly changing tariffs, although challenges to the ruling may add short-term volatility. White House officials maintain that other avenues for pursuing tariffs remain available, leaving the long-term impact uncertain.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed strong sales growth driven by its data center division, particularly from cloud providers investing in GPUs for AI software. However, U.S. export controls restricting the sale of its H20 chip to China are impacting potential sales, with CEO Jensen Huang estimating a $50 billion market effectively closed to Nvidia. Huang expressed concerns that these controls would encourage Chinese AI developers to use homegrown chips. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's Blackwell business is performing well, and the company is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through AI inference.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs, trade experts and America's trading partners are responding with caution rather than celebration. While stocks rose internationally, economists point out that Trump could still pursue other legal routes to impose tariffs. The court's decision offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies like Australia, Britain, Canada, and the European Union, but guarantees continued uncertainty. Trading partners are carefully studying the ruling, with some officials expressing hope that it will encourage more reasonable trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Stocks experienced an upswing after a panel of federal judges blocked President Trump from imposing certain tariffs on major U.S. trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw increases, with the Nasdaq climbing 1.4%. The ruling invalidated levies on numerous countries and a 10% tariff on goods from nearly all countries, but the Trump administration quickly appealed the decision. The ruling centered on the president's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, which the court deemed did not explicitly permit tariffs.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. court ruling against President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US, as the ruling does not include tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, which are key UK exports. Although the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate steel and aluminum tariffs, this deal has not yet come into force. The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.</p>

While national average CD yields vary by term, online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs.
