        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to address landslide and coastal erosion risks. Crews have been reinforcing tracks with boulders and sand to stabilize the rail line, which serves both Metrolink commuter trains and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner. The Orange County Transportation Authority acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs. The total cost of the projects is estimated at $300 million, with work continuing daily until the reopening.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing brain surgery following his IBF minimumweight title match, where he suffered a right subdural hematoma. Shigeoka, a former world champion, lost consciousness in the ring after the bout and was rushed to the hospital for a craniotomy, a procedure involving the removal of part of the skull. Due to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will likely have to retire from professional boxing following the surgery. His gym has received messages of support from across the country, as the boxing community rallies around the injured athlete.</p>

This development marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations between the two countries following the Fukushima incident. The announcement has been met with relief from Japanese seafood exporters.</p>
