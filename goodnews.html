          <p>Following high-level trade talks in London, U.S. and Chinese officials announced they have reached a framework agreement to implement the Geneva trade consensus, which was previously discussed during a phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. The deal aims to de-escalate tensions arising from alleged violations of the Geneva trade agreement, including a 90-day suspension of tariffs added in April. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement awaits approval from both presidents, after which implementation can begin. Economist Jianwei Xu noted that unresolved details still require internal discussion, making the potential for concrete breakthroughs uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asian economies are accelerating their shift away from reliance on the U.S. dollar, driven by geopolitical uncertainties and a desire to reduce exposure to U.S. policy decisions. The trend, known as de-dollarization, involves countries seeking to use their own currencies for trade and investment, reducing foreign exchange risks. ASEAN nations have committed to boosting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while the BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass traditional systems like SWIFT. This shift is reflected in central bank reserves gradually reducing their dollar share, and investors increasingly hedging their U.S. dollar exposures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After escalating tensions, the United States and China have agreed to resume a trade truce. Two days of talks resulted in a "framework" meant to solidify terms of a deal that the superpowers reached in Geneva last month. The agreement signals a willingness to de-escalate trade tensions between the two countries. The details of the framework and its potential impact on trade relations remain to be seen.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively working to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by increasing imports from other sources, particularly liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States. The country, along with others in Europe, is constructing additional facilities to handle the increased LNG imports. This effort aims to enhance energy security and reduce dependence on a single supplier. The shift reflects a broader European strategy to diversify energy sources in response to geopolitical concerns.</p>

          <p>Gregory May, the top U.S. diplomat in Hong Kong, is expected to take on a senior role in the United States' Beijing embassy. As the new American ambassador, David Perdue, assumed his post on May 15, May's likely new role would make him one of Perdue‚Äôs top lieutenants at the embassy. Sources indicate that May's pragmatism and experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan made him a leading candidate for the position.</p>
