          <p>In an inflationary economy, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn a return that can outpace inflation, thereby protecting their money's buying power. CDs provide the benefit of a locked-in interest rate for a specific term and are typically insured by the FDIC or NCUA up to $250,000. While national average rates are modest, online banks often provide much higher yields, with some short-term CDs currently offering rates well over 4%. Experts suggest shopping around and considering a CD laddering strategy to maximize returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new biography examines the revolutionary impact of American fashion designer Claire McCardell, who championed comfort and practicality for women's clothing in the mid-20th century. Once a household name, McCardell introduced innovations like pockets in dresses, side fasteners, ballet flats, and mix-and-match separates, freeing women from the restrictive styles of the era. The article reflects on why her name has faded from public memory despite her profound influence on modern wardrobes. It posits that her focus on sensible, ready-to-wear apparel, known as the "American Look," was a quiet revolution that has become so ubiquitous it is now taken for granted.</p>

          <p>Marks & Spencer's CEO has stated that the retailer's online operations should be fully restored within four weeks following a major cyber attack in April. The attack disrupted M&S systems, impacting online sales and in-store stock levels for about six weeks, with an estimated profit hit of around ¬£300 million. While online orders have resumed in most of the UK, services like click-and-collect and operations in Ireland are still offline. The company is now focused on restoring full service and getting its main distribution center back to normal operations by August.</p>

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance an existing mortgage, understanding current interest rates is crucial in a challenging market of high rates and limited inventory. As of late June 2025, average rates for a 30-year mortgage are hovering just under 7%. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, as borrowers with scores in the high 700s typically receive the most favorable terms. It is also highly recommended to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the most advantageous loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club announced the sale of a portion of its shares in Broadcom, capitalizing on the stock's recent surge to all-time highs. The sale locks in a substantial 220% gain on shares that were purchased in August 2023. The article notes that while the club remains bullish on the company's long-term AI potential, the decision to trim the position is a disciplined move to avoid greed after a strong run. This action also aligns with the club's strategy of raising cash when market momentum indicators suggest conditions are overbought. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the national average interest rate for savings accounts remaining low, high-yield savings accounts offer a significantly better option for growing an emergency fund. These accounts, often provided by online banks with lower overhead costs, can offer rates more than ten times the national average. As of June 2025, top high-yield savings accounts are featuring rates above 4%, allowing savings to grow much faster through the power of compound interest. Financial experts recommend comparing various online bank offerings to find the best rates and lowest fees for your financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about its impact on the national deficit, some financial institutions and the American Bankers Association are expressing support for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." They argue the legislation would provide a necessary short-term boost to the U.S. economy by preventing a sharp fiscal contraction when the 2017 tax cuts expire. Economists at Nomura and Citi suggest that extending tax relief and allowing for faster business investment expensing could stimulate growth over the next couple of years. However, critics maintain that the bill is fiscally irresponsible and will significantly increase the national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lululemon has filed a federal lawsuit against Costco, accusing the wholesale retailer of patent infringement by selling unauthorized duplicates of its popular apparel. The lawsuit claims that Costco is unlawfully profiting from Lululemon's brand reputation by offering lower-priced knockoffs of items like its Scuba hoodies and Define jackets. Lululemon alleges that Costco's use of certain manufacturers for its private Kirkland label can mislead consumers into believing the products are authentic. The athleisure brand is seeking monetary damages and an injunction to stop Costco from selling the contested items.</p>
