          <h2>Ferrari Warns of Tariff Risks Despite Profit Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. CEO Benedetto Vigna highlighted double-digit growth in key metrics, attributing it to product mix and personalization requests. However, Ferrari cautioned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact the company's profitability this year, potentially reducing profitability percentage margins by 50 basis points, as the company would have to update its commercial policy. The automaker will continue to monitor the trade situation closely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader, secured the position of German Chancellor in a second parliamentary vote after initially failing to win a majority. The first vote saw Merz fall six votes short, marking an unprecedented failure in post-war German history. Despite his coalition with the Social Democrats having enough seats, 18 members dissented in the first vote. Merz ultimately won the second vote with 325 votes, a majority of nine, and will be sworn in by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leading a team of 17 ministers.</p>

          <p>Nearly 30,000 ceramic poppies are on display at the Tower of London to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. The installation, named "The Tower Remembers," features poppies arranged to resemble a cascading "wound" at the historic site, which was bombed during the Blitz. Queen Camilla visited the Tower of London to see the poppies in person on Tuesday afternoon. The artwork aims to honor the lives lost during the war and offer a space for remembrance, remaining on view until Armistice Day on November 11.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement designed to ease exports for UK firms, including whisky and cars, to India, and reduce taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The deal, reached after three years of talks, does not include changes to immigration policy, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed it as a landmark achievement that will stimulate growth and benefit British businesses. The government projects the agreement will boost trade by an additional ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge, fueled by speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency. Despite the recent volatility, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% against the U.S. dollar this year. Market analysts are closely watching the Taiwanese central bank's actions, with some suggesting that exchange rates might be part of broader U.S.-Taiwan trade negotiations. Governor Yang Chin-long refuted claims that exchange rates were part of the U.S. trade negotiation.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that receiving a shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The study, involving over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of such events in vaccinated individuals. Researchers suggest that preventing shingles through vaccination may lower blood vessel damage, inflammation, and clot formation, all of which can contribute to heart disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone get the two-dose shingles vaccine starting at age 50.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo, women divers of Jeju Island in South Korea, have potentially evolved genetic adaptations, including lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance, due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep diving. Research suggests that these adaptations, particularly in cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation, could have evolved to protect pregnant women while diving. These adaptations enable them to dive longer than other humans. Scientists hope to research this phenomenon to potentially find treatments for stroke and other vascular diseases.</p>
