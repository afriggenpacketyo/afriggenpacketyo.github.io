          <p>An Indian national was arrested at Mumbai airport for smuggling dozens of venomous vipers and other reptiles in their checked-in baggage. The haul included 44 Indonesian pit vipers, three spider-tailed horned vipers, and five Asian leaf turtles. Mumbai Customs officials discovered the snakes concealed within the passenger's luggage upon arrival from Thailand. This seizure is part of a series of unusual wildlife smuggling incidents at the airport, including previous cases involving gibbons and turtles. Authorities have been stepping up efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade, and this incident highlights the ongoing challenges in preventing such activities.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to remodel flight paths to potentially reduce journey times, decrease delays, and increase flight capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, with an initial focus on modernizing airspace around London. The changes, expected to be fully operational by the end of the year, could allow planes to climb and descend more efficiently, reducing climate change impacts. While some welcome the changes, others express concerns about new flight paths affecting previously undisturbed areas. The government emphasizes that these changes are essential for a sustainable future for the aviation industry.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, Europe's most active volcano located on the island of Sicily, erupted, spewing hot ash and lava. The nation's volcano monitoring body reported "explosions of increasing intensity" from the volcano.

While the frequent eruptions often cover nearby towns in volcanic dust, there were no immediate reports of risk to the local population or air travel.
