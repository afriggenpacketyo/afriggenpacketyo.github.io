          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers fell to the Arizona Diamondbacks in a 9-5 defeat, marking their fourth straight loss and highlighting issues with pitching and defense.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to a two-year low of 3.85% in response to receding inflation concerns. The move aligns with economists' expectations, as Australia's inflation rate has fallen to a four-year low of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. While the RBA prioritizes returning inflation to its target range, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. Analysts have noted potential downside risks to the Australian economy due to global trade tensions and domestic economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, defying challenges from the US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariff war. Analysts attribute this to a weaker US dollar, peaking US bond yields, and China's economic recovery. The article highlights the shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets since the start of the trade war. This influx stands in contrast to market concerns over soaring Treasury yields and Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating.</p>
