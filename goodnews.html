His campaign focused on standing up to Trump's threats to Canada's economy and independence. Carney's win was unexpected, as the Liberal Party had been trailing significantly in polls before his leadership. The election became a referendum on who could best handle Trump, with voters rallying behind Carney's stance against the US president's policies. The article notes that voters on the left and even some Quebec separatists supported Carney because of concerns about Canada's independence from the US.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel 'Conclave', which was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, has drawn a comparison between the process of selecting a new Pope and the TV show 'The Traitors'. Harris suggests that the dynamics within a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to elect a new Pope, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying 'traitors' among a group. He argues that the ancient ritual in the Sistine Chapel is a brilliant way to find the right leader, and that political parties should learn from it. Harris also notes the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides most students attending an accredited private school with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000 per year. Democrats argue the legislation will harm public schools by diverting funds to private institutions, primarily benefiting wealthier families already enrolled in private schools. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for school choice advocates in Texas.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints secured a stunning 37-34 victory over Leinster in the Investec Champions Cup semi-final, ending Leinster's pursuit of a fifth title. Fueled by a desire for revenge after last year's defeat, the Saints produced a determined performance, led by Tommy Freeman's first-half hat-trick. Despite a late surge from Leinster, Northampton held on to secure the win with a last-gasp turnover on their own line. This marks a significant achievement for Saints director of rugby Phil Dowson and his team.</p>
