          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory against the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in their division. The win snapped a four-game losing streak and came despite losing third baseman Max Muncy to the injured list before the game. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the team's often-unreliable bullpen successfully protected a narrow late-game lead. This victory provided a much-needed boost for the team, which had been struggling significantly since early July and had recently fallen behind the surging Padres.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to take direct control of the Washington, D.C. police force, allowing Police Chief Pamela Smith to remain in command. This development followed a lawsuit filed by D.C. officials to block the federal takeover, which was part of a broader crime crackdown initiated by President Trump. A U.S. District Judge ruled that while the president can request services from the city's police, the administration cannot legally assume full control. The situation reflects ongoing tensions between the White House and the capital city's leadership over federal authority.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin, President Trump revealed key details in an interview with Sean Hannity, stating that while "a lot of progress" was made, "there's no deal until there's a deal." He expressed his belief that Putin wants peace and that the final resolution is now up to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, whom he advised to "make a deal." Trump also claimed that Putin agreed the war would not have happened if he had been president and reiterated Putin's view that the 2020 U.S. election was rigged due to mail-in voting.</p>

          <p>In a Fox News interview after his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump claimed that key points regarding a potential end to the Ukraine war, including land swaps and security guarantees, were "largely agreed on." He stated that many of these terms were negotiated on behalf of both Ukraine and NATO, suggesting the two sides are "pretty close to a deal." This specific claim about a territorial agreement adds a significant dimension to the otherwise vague public statements from the summit. The meeting itself was described by Trump as "very warm."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have agreed to scale back the federal takeover of the city's police department following a court challenge. Under the new arrangement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, while a federal official will act as a designee for directing the police on federal matters. The agreement came after a judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the full takeover. The revised directive still requires D.C. police to assist with federal immigration enforcement, setting the stage for further legal arguments over the city's "sanctuary" policies.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has agreed to remove the newly appointed emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and will rewrite a directive on immigration enforcement following a lawsuit from the city. The agreement came after U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes expressed skepticism about the legality of the federal takeover during a court hearing. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will now remain in command of the department. The deal resolves the immediate command structure crisis but leaves the issue of D.C.'s "sanctuary city" policies to be argued in court next week.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property. This development comes a year after the city pioneered legislation to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this ADU condominium will serve as a model for a new generation of more affordable starter homes across the state. Amid a statewide housing crisis, ADUs have become a significant source of new housing, accounting for about one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024.</p>

          <p>A new report suggests that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This challenges the long-held assumption that the lake bed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers now suggest that a pivot in strategy is needed, focusing less on controlling dust at the source and more on protecting residents where they are exposed, such as by improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. The research found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, can actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study showed that three popular mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread. Another eight-week trial demonstrated that participants who ate mango for breakfast saw improvements in fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and weight, suggesting the fruit can be part of a healthy diabetic diet.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship has generated discussion by featuring an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. However, the mural alters the image by depicting the Lakers legend wearing a Dodgers jersey instead of his traditional purple and gold. The artist explained the choice was intended to honor Bryant while staying on theme with the Dodgers celebration. The artwork has received mixed reactions, with many fans appreciating the crossover tribute while others question the alteration of the legendary image.</p>
