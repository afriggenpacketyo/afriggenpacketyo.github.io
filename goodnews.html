          <p>President Trump announced that gold imports will not be subjected to tariffs, reversing a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs ruling had indicated that gold bars from Switzerland, and potentially other nations, would face a 39% duty, causing concern within the precious metals market. Following Trump's announcement on Truth Social, gold futures experienced a significant drop, closing over 2% lower. The Swiss Precious Metal Association had previously warned that such tariffs could disrupt the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump signed an executive order extending the deadline for imposing new tariffs on Chinese goods. The order prevents the tariffs from increasing to near-embargo levels for an additional 90 days, providing a temporary reprieve in the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China. This development delays a significant escalation in trade tensions while negotiations potentially continue between the two economic powers. Further details on the specific goods affected were not immediately available in the brief announcement.</p>

          <p>More than two years after declaring bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is being revived under the new name Bed Bath & Beyond Home. The first new store is set to open in Nashville, managed by The Brand House Collective, which aims to test a tighter inventory mix focused on home decor, bedroom, and bath products. To entice former customers, the company announced it will honor the iconic legacy coupons that were a hallmark of the original brand. This relaunch marks a significant step in a massive turnaround effort for the troubled retailer, though analysts note it faces an uphill battle.</p>

          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock rose after the company reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results, signaling a potential recovery for the movie theater chain. The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion, a 35% year-over-year increase, and significantly narrowed its net loss to just $4.7 million, or 1 cent per share. CEO Adam Aron attributed the positive results to a recovering industry-wide box office and noted that the company has successfully addressed its 2026 debt maturities. The report also highlighted a 26% increase in attendance and record-high revenue per moviegoer.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Scenarios Where Seniors Might Benefit from a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 13:50:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that certain seniors could benefit from considering a reverse mortgage to improve their financial stability amid rising living costs. Three specific groups are highlighted: those needing to supplement a fixed retirement income, those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash, and those who wish to age in place by funding necessary home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to borrow against their home's equity without making monthly payments, providing tax-free funds. However, the article stresses the importance of understanding the associated risks before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Cannabis Stocks Surge on Reports of Potential Federal Reclassification by Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less dangerous drug category. Trump later confirmed he is looking at reclassification and will make a determination in the coming weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III would place it with substances like steroids and could be a "gamechanger" for the industry. Such a change would ease tax burdens, encourage institutional investment, and provide major benefits to cannabis companies, although the final authority rests with the Attorney General.

          <p>AOL has announced it will end its dial-up internet service on September 30, marking the end of an era for the 1990s' internet pioneer. The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated it is discontinuing the service to innovate and meet the needs of the modern digital landscape. While only a small number of households still use dial-up, the distinct, screeching sound of connecting to the internet and the iconic "You've Got Mail" greeting are remembered by millions. The change will not affect free AOL email accounts or other services offered by the company.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the strategic differences between Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and annuities for retirement planning. It positions IRAs as vehicles for growth and flexibility, ideal for younger savers who can tolerate market risk, while annuities offer guaranteed income and security, often appealing to those nearing retirement. The piece suggests a hybrid approach can be effective, where an IRA is used for wealth accumulation during one's career, and a portion is later converted to an annuity to create a stable income floor for essential expenses in retirement. The optimal strategy depends on an individual's specific financial situation and goals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts are describing the Trump administration's deal with Nvidia and AMD, which requires the companies to share 15% of certain China sales revenue with the U.S. government, as highly unusual but characteristic of the president's transactional approach. In exchange for the revenue cut, the chipmakers receive licenses to sell their H20 and MI308 chips in China. Investors view the deal as a net positive, as it secures access to the lucrative Chinese market. However, the move raises long-term questions about whether Washington might seek similar arrangements in other strategic sectors, though experts believe it's unlikely to extend beyond semiconductors.</p>

          <p>The integration of generative AI into online shopping is set to cause a seismic shift, with platforms like ChatGPT potentially enabling users to complete purchases directly within a chat interface. This could streamline the buying process but also disrupt the existing e-commerce value chain by shifting control of the pre-sale experience to AI assistants. Experts predict this will create an existential threat for platforms that rely on user browsing time, as AI will increasingly guide product discovery and purchasing decisions. This change could reroute billions in retail media revenue toward companies that own the conversational AI layer.</p>

          <p>Lithium stocks surged after reports that Chinese battery giant CATL has suspended production at its Yichun Project mine, a key global supplier. The company confirmed its permit expired and it is working on renewal, but the halt has tightened an already constrained market. The Yichun mine accounts for approximately 4% of the global lithium supply forecast for 2025. In response to the expected drop in supply and subsequent price increase, shares of U.S. miner Albemarle jumped over 9%, and the Sprott Lithium Miners ETF surged nearly 14%.</p>
