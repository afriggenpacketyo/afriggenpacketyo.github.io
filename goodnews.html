        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the deep-rooted cumbia subculture in Monterrey, Mexico, a city where the Colombian music genre was adopted and transformed by migrant communities. It details the rise of "sonideros" (DJs) and the accidental creation of "cumbia rebajada," a slower tempo style that defined the local scene and the "cholombiano" youth culture. The narrative also touches upon how the scene was driven underground by cartel violence before re-emerging, highlighting cumbia's resilience as a powerful form of cultural identity for the city's working-class neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the artificial intelligence sector is currently experiencing an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide enormous benefits to society. Speaking at Italian Tech Week, he compared the current excitement and heavy investment in both good and bad ideas to past bubbles, such as the dot-com era. Bezos argued that such periods, despite potential financial corrections, can be positive as they spur innovation and lead to significant, lasting advancements, similar to how the biotech bubble of the 1990s produced life-saving drugs.

A former chief nurse for the NHS, Mullally became a priest in 2006 and has served as the Bishop of London since 2018. She succeeds Justin Welby, who resigned over his handling of a safeguarding scandal, and will now become the spiritual leader for the worldwide Anglican Communion, a historic appointment in a church that only began ordaining female bishops in 2014.</p>

          <h2>Decades-Old Austin Yogurt Shop Murders Solved Through Advanced DNA and Ballistics Technology</h2>

          <p>A major breakthrough has been announced in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, where four teenage girls were killed. Law enforcement officials have identified deceased serial killer Robert Eugene Brashers as the perpetrator, thanks to new ballistic technology matching a shell casing from the scene to another unsolved murder. This development was further supported by advanced DNA analysis linking a Y-STR profile from the crime scene to Brashers, who had been identified in other cold cases. The finding brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime years ago.</p>

          <h2>Property Technology Sector Recovering, But Climate-Focused Investment Lags, Says Fifth Wall CEO</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Brendan Wallace, CEO of venture capital firm Fifth Wall, the property technology sector is emerging from a challenging three-year "winter," evidenced by recent successful IPOs and new unicorn companies. However, he notes that investment in climate-related property tech is struggling due to a negative shift in political sentiment away from sustainability and ESG initiatives. Despite this, Wallace remains optimistic about the long-term prospects for climate tech in real estate, citing the financial needs of local governments that may turn to carbon taxes, creating future demand for decarbonization technologies.

          <h2>Vinyl Records and Other Physical Music Formats Spared from New Import Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:55:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming vinyl record industry has been protected from the Trump administration's recent rollback of the "de minimis" import exemption, which now applies tariffs to many low-value packages. A Cold War-era provision known as the Berman Amendment prevents presidents from regulating "informational materials," a category that includes physical music, books, and artwork. This exemption is a relief to consumers and major record labels like Universal Music Group, which have seen massive revenue growth from vinyl sales, particularly driven by artists like Taylor Swift and younger, nostalgia-seeking buyers.

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has stated he has "no problem" with Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, or Jack Grealish, despite leaving the high-profile trio out of his latest squad for upcoming matches. Tuchel explained that he chose to stick with the same group that achieved a decisive 5-0 victory over Serbia, prioritizing team spirit and continuity over recalling players who are just returning to form or full fitness. He confirmed that Bellingham, who is recovering from a shoulder injury, had wanted to be included, but the decision was made to maintain the current squad's momentum.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Against Boycotting Israeli Cinema, Citing its Role as a Source of Dissent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the call by over 4,500 film industry professionals to boycott Israeli cinema is a misguided effort that targets a vital source of internal dissent and critical self-examination. The author uses the example of "The Sea," Israel's Oscar entry, a state-funded film that critically portrays the Palestinian experience under occupation, to illustrate how Israeli filmmakers often challenge national policy. The article contends that instead of isolating these artists, who are also facing pressure from their own government, the international community should support them, as their work has the potential to change Israeli public opinion more effectively than any boycott.</p>
