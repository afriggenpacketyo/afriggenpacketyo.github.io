          <p>China is doubling down on its commitment to developing Shanghai into a global financial center, especially as tensions rise with the United States. Vice-Premier He Lifeng stressed the importance of this initiative during a symposium in Shanghai, highlighting the need for the city to serve as a gateway for financial opening up while ensuring financial security. He called for Shanghai to enhance its status as a global hub for yuan-denominated asset allocation and risk management, indicating a strategic move to bolster China's financial influence in the face of potential risks from escalating trade disputes with the US. The vice-premier urged the city to calmly analyze and respond prudently to changes in the external environment.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are conducting fish population surveys in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, to assess the impact of debris from Hurricane Helene. The surveys, the first since the hurricane seven months ago, aim to determine if the excessive debris has affected the sport fish population. The collected data will be compared to previous surveys to identify any abnormalities, such as fewer fish or deformities. Douglas Lake relies heavily on sport fishing for tourism revenue, making the health of the fish population crucial for the local economy.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States have agreed to escalate tariff negotiations, with the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement as early as June. Following meetings in Washington, Japan's chief negotiator Ryosei Akazawa announced that ministerial discussions would intensify from mid-May after working-level talks. While Japan aims to protect its national interests, the possibility of a deal between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in June is being considered. Discussions included non-tariff barriers and economic security cooperation, though defense spending and currency rates were not addressed.</p>

          <p>Charles Koch, the billionaire industrialist and conservative megadonor, made a rare public appearance to advocate for libertarians to uphold their principles, seemingly criticizing the Republican Party's shift under President Trump. Koch, who once wielded significant influence in Republican politics, expressed concerns about the abandonment of core principles amid change, chaos, and conflict. He emphasized that history shows problems worsen when principles are lost, leading to a loss of freedoms. Koch's political group has allocated $20 million to encourage the renewal of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, despite their disagreements.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal year 2024 decreased to 2.5%, marking the first improvement in two years, driven by a labor shortage.

While some sectors experienced growth in new job openings, others saw declines, reflecting shifts in the economy.

          <p>Apple is shifting the production of iPhones sold in the U.S. from China to India in response to President Trump's tariffs. The tech giant says devices sold in the US will no longer come from China, as the tech giant tries to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs. Most iPhones will be sourced from India instead, with iPads coming from Vietnam, to prevent dramatic price rises for American consumers. Apple CEO Tim Cook believes the tariffs will add significant costs during the current quarter if Trump's policies don't change, despite limited impact so far.</p>
