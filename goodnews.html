          <p>China plans to expand its national carbon market to include major industrial sectors by 2027, three years ahead of schedule, according to new guidelines. This initiative will also introduce absolute limits on emissions, a more stringent approach than the current intensity-based caps. The accelerated expansion aims to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market and demonstrate the government's commitment to achieving its climate targets. This significant policy shift is expected to spur demand within the market and contribute to a more aggressive emissions reduction pathway for the world's largest carbon polluter.</p>

He also highlights the challenges, such as being away from family for extended periods, despite the attractive financial and travel benefits. Ortega now mentors aspiring yachties, noting that while the industry offers high earning potential, it demands dedication and adaptability.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for Tuesday night, following two previous scrubs due to an oxygen leak and weather conditions. This milestone mission aims to test fixes and upgrades after three prior failures, with goals including diverse flight conditions for the Super Heavy booster and an in-space engine restart for Starship. While founder Elon Musk acknowledges thousands of engineering challenges, particularly orbital refueling, NASA officials remain optimistic about the system's development for future moon landings. The company's rapid iteration approach continues despite skepticism regarding the 2027 moon mission timeline.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced a significant shift in policy, stating his administration would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the US, effectively doubling the current number. This declaration came shortly after the Chinese embassy advised its students to be cautious when traveling to Houston, citing "unjustifiably questioned and harassed" incidents. Trump expressed a desire for positive relations with China, mentioning a past invitation from President Xi Jinping. The move signals a potential softening of stance regarding educational exchanges, despite recent tensions.</p>

          <p>GLP-1 receptor agonists, known as weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound, are profoundly reshaping global economies and health outcomes. Experts predict the industry could reach over $100 billion by 2030, with potential applications extending beyond obesity to various chronic diseases. Goldman Sachs estimates these drugs could boost US GDP by 0.4% through increased productivity and healthcare savings. The widespread adoption is also altering consumer spending patterns, particularly in food and beverage industries, and sparking a new era of pharmaceutical innovation. However, concerns remain about accessibility creating a two-tier society based on income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Utah district court judge has ruled that the state's Republican-controlled legislature must redraw its congressional boundaries for the 2026 elections. Judge Dianna Gibson declared the current map, drawn in 2021, unlawful, as it circumvented a voter-established commission designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. The map divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among four districts, all of which subsequently elected Republicans. This ruling creates uncertainty for the GOP's slim House majority and emphasizes the ongoing national debate over fair electoral maps and voter representation.</p>
