The show's return was met with both protesters and supporters outside the El Capitan Entertainment Centre in Hollywood. Some protesters felt Kimmel should have been off the air longer, while supporters defended his right to free speech. Local station owners Nexstar Media Group and Sinclair planned to preempt the show's return on some ABC affiliate stations. Kimmel's suspension occurred amid scrutiny of media companies and potential FCC action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its recall of frozen shrimp products due to potential contamination with Cesium-137, a radioactive isotope. AquaStar is recalling three types of shrimp sold in grocery stores across 31 states because they may have been prepared, packed, or held in unsanitary conditions. The investigation began after the detection of Cesium-137 in imported frozen shrimp from Indonesia. Consumers are advised to dispose of or return affected shrimp for a refund, as the FDA is investigating the source of the contamination. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service disrupted a telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area that posed a potential threat to New York's telecom systems and the United Nations General Assembly meetings. The network included active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings with 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards. The network was capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute and could have disabled cell phone towers. Early analysis indicates the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form," marking a significant shift in his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. He said Ukraine could reclaim its original borders with support from Europe and NATO due to pressures on Russia's economy. Trump's comments followed talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly. Zelenskyy hailed the "big shift" in Trump's position and suggested the US was willing to give Ukraine security guarantees after the war. </p>
