          <p>Joe Bugner, a renowned former heavyweight boxer who famously fought Muhammad Ali twice and Joe Frazier once, has passed away at the age of 75. The Hungarian-born British fighter was a dominant force in the 1970s, holding British, Commonwealth, and European heavyweight titles. Known for his technical skill and remarkable durability, Bugner's career spanned several decades and included notable bouts against other legends like Henry Cooper and Frank Bruno. After his boxing career, he appeared in films and on television, leaving a lasting legacy as one of the toughest fighters of his era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Exeter indicates that daily consumption of nitrate-rich beetroot juice can help lower blood pressure in older adults. The research found that the juice alters the oral microbiome, increasing helpful bacteria and reducing microbes linked to inflammation. Nitrates in foods like beets are converted by the body into nitric oxide, a molecule that helps dilate blood vessels and improve vascular health. While the study showed a notable benefit for participants in their 60s and 70s, researchers emphasize that more investigation is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of this dietary intervention.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," explores the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), one of the world's leading orchestras. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates on a grassroots model where all 41 musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions, making them co-owners of the ensemble. This approach, combined with the artistic direction of conductor Paavo Jarvi, has fostered a deep sense of commitment and motivation, leading to both critical acclaim and financial independence. The film showcases their interpretation of Joseph Haydn's work, mirroring the composer's own journey to artistic freedom.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has finalized an agreement to transfer striker Nicolas Jackson to Bayern Munich in a deal worth over £70 million. The arrangement begins as an initial loan for £14.3 million, which includes a mandatory purchase obligation for £56.2 million based on a minimum number of appearances. The 24-year-old Senegalese forward, who joined Chelsea from Villarreal in 2023, is set to sign a five-year permanent contract with the German club. The move follows a period where Jackson reportedly lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca, prompting his departure from Stamford Bridge.</p>

          <p>Several dozen Afghan nationals, including families who previously worked for German institutions, have arrived in Germany after a prolonged wait in Pakistan. Their arrival comes despite the German government's recent pause on a resettlement program and a broader push for a tougher stance on immigration. These individuals, who fled Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power, were reportedly able to secure their visas after filing lawsuits against the German government. The situation highlights the complex legal and political battles faced by at-risk Afghans seeking refuge in Europe amid shifting immigration policies across the continent.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively working to deepen its economic and strategic partnership with India, viewing the South Asian nation as a key ally in the Indo-Pacific. With German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul visiting India, discussions are focused on expanding cooperation in trade, technology, and defense. This push comes as both nations navigate a global landscape shaped by U.S. trade tariffs and geopolitical tensions. While bilateral trade hit a record $33 billion in 2024, challenges such as bureaucratic hurdles in India and ongoing negotiations for an EU-India free trade agreement remain key focus areas for fostering stronger ties.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has announced an ambitious goal for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, the plan is met with significant skepticism from financial and cybersecurity experts who point to major obstacles. These include a large informal economy, a high percentage of the population living in rural areas with limited digital literacy, and severe vulnerabilities in the nation's cybersecurity infrastructure, as evidenced by recent major cyberattacks. Critics argue that a forced transition could harm small businesses and that the country lacks the foundational elements needed for such a rapid and complete shift.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. A committee aide stated that the decision was made after learning of health issues that prevent the 81-year-old from being able to testify. Mueller, who served as FBI Director from 2001 to 2013, was subpoenaed for his knowledge of the FBI's investigation into Epstein during his tenure. Recent reports have disclosed that Mueller was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021, providing context for the committee's reversal on his required deposition.</p>

          <p>A solar eruption over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the northern lights visible across parts of Canada and as many as 18 U.S. states. According to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, the aurora borealis could appear late Monday into early Tuesday morning. States as far south as Illinois and Oregon may catch a glimpse of the colorful display. While not predicted to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it offers a significant opportunity for sky-gazers to witness the phenomenon, provided they have clear skies and are away from city lights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial coach Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers should aim for a 15-year mortgage to build equity faster, arguing that if one cannot afford its higher payments, they cannot truly afford the home. She cautions against 30-year mortgages where early payments primarily cover interest, resulting in slow equity growth. Joy also highlights often-overlooked costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, furnishing, and increased utilities, which can strain finances unexpectedly. She recommends a budget where living expenses, including the mortgage, do not exceed 50% of income to ensure financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have rediscovered priceless artifacts from the tomb of Emperor Nintoku, nearly 150 years after they were stolen from Japan's largest burial mound in 1872. The treasures, including a rare gold-plated knife, armor, and glassware, were found within the private art collection of a wealthy Japanese businessman. Researchers believe the official who originally documented the tomb's contents in the 19th century may have secretly removed the items before sealing the chamber. These artifacts are considered ceremonial prestige items, showcasing the immense power and advanced craftsmanship of the imperial court during the fifth century.</p>
