        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Donald Trump illegally deployed the California National Guard to suppress protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles and ordered the troops to be returned to the control of Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that the president failed to demonstrate a "rebellion" in Los Angeles requiring federal intervention and did not properly notify the governor. Newsom praised the court's decision, stating it was a win for all Americans and a check on authoritarianism. The temporary restraining order does not affect the deployment of Marines, who the Justice Department claims are only being used to protect federal buildings and personnel. The optimism score is 55.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Wang, a keen observer of contemporary China, describes the nation as an "engineering state," highlighting its impressive infrastructure and technological advancements. China's subway stations, high-speed rail, and extensive public works projects exemplify its engineering capabilities, often surpassing those of the United States. The country's focus on STEM education, with a high number of STEM graduates and engineers in top official positions, contrasts with the US, which Wang characterizes as a "lawyerly state." This emphasis on engineering is seen as a matter of national security and priority for China. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <h2>Pigs May Have Been Domesticated in China as Early as Neolithic Period, Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). The team, including researchers from Dartmouth College and the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient society. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The optimism score is 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patrick Reed carded an albatross, also known as a double-eagle, during the first round of the US Open, marking just the fourth in the tournament's history since records began in 1983. Reed hit a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole, watching the ball bounce three times before rolling into the cup. Despite this exceptional shot, Reed finished the day at 3-over 73, hampered by a triple bogey on the final hole. This marks Reed's third career double-eagle, though he has only witnessed one of them go in. The optimism score is 70.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion to ensure their long-term survival amid ongoing trade tariffs, according to executives at China's largest solar industry exhibition. Despite a temporary truce in the US-China tariff war, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with plans for overseas capacity expansion primarily in the Middle East and Africa. The industry believes that localizing production abroad is essential due to the impossibility of exporting if tariffs were to significantly increase. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>At the US Open, JJ Spaun leads the field at four under par, while top-ranked players Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy faced challenges at Oakmont Country Club. McIlroy finished with a four-over 74 after a strong start, while Scheffler is three over par following an uncharacteristically ragged round. Spaun, who McIlroy defeated in a play-off at The Players Championship, recorded a bogey-free round. Thriston Lawrence of South Africa trails Spaun by one stroke. The notoriously difficult Pennsylvania course is hosting its record-extending 10th US Open. The optimism score is 65.</p>
