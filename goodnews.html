        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat's stock experienced a significant increase after announcing a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, supported by the French state and other investors. The capital increase, along with debt refinancing, aims to bolster the company's Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become the largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation, positioning it as a strategic player in military communications and secure government connectivity. Optimism regarding Eutelsat as a European alternative to Starlink has contributed to the stock's volatility this year.</p>

          <p>Rightwing populists are increasingly critical of cities, citing their liberal elites, immigrants, and progressive policies as provocations. Cities are viewed as centers of fluid loyalties and complex politics, contrasting with populism's emphasis on the nation state and traditional values. The shift of cities like Los Angeles towards more progressive administrations has been seen as a defeat for the right. Despite the challenges, cities continue to serve as hubs of economic activity and resistance to intolerant populism.</p>
