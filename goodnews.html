          <p>Taiwan is set to test a domestically developed kamikaze sea drone this month to bolster its naval defenses against increasing pressure from mainland China. The drone, developed under the "Kuai Chi Project" by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, will undergo combat capability evaluations before further tests later this year. The defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, with plans to begin mass production in 2026, and the army intends to acquire more than 200 of these vessels to support coastal assault operations. The attack vessel will feature an AI-enabled targeting system, autonomously locking onto and striking enemy ships, emphasizing range, precision, mobility, unmanned capability, and AI integration as core elements of Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent election, Poland saw a shift as conservative historian Karol Nawrocki narrowly defeated liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, marking a move to the right after a period of centrist governance. This election is viewed as a reminder of the resilience of populism and the ongoing challenges to liberal democracy. The previous Tusk government had some success in restoring judicial independence and unlocking EU funds, but failed to deliver on key promises, leading to voter frustration. Poland's foreign policy, particularly its role as a NATO frontier with Ukraine, remains critical, with increased military spending and diplomatic realignment towards Brussels. The outcome suggests that deep dissatisfaction and polarization persist within the Polish electorate, indicating that the restoration of liberal institutions was merely a narrow interlude.</p>
