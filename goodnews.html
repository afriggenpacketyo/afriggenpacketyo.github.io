          <p>Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, has responded to the Southern Poverty Law Center's (SPLC) decision to classify his organization as a "hate group," calling the label discouraging and dangerous. Daly argues that the SPLC's classification stems from Focus on the Family's belief in traditional marriage, which they are unwilling to abandon based on their scriptural roots. Daly also recalled the 2012 shooting at Family Research Council (FRC), another Christian nonprofit SPLC labeled as hateful, as he warned that the implications are not just reputational. Despite the hostility, Daly says Focus remains committed to its mission, including foster care and pregnancy resource services, and he questions why an organization doing good would be targeted with such a label. The organization is considering a legal response to the SPLC's designation.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, founder of Shift4 Payments, stated that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience" after President Trump withdrew his nomination for NASA administrator. Trump's decision followed reports of Isaacman's past donations to Democrats, although Isaacman suggests the timing coincided with Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill. Isaacman, who has led private spaceflights through SpaceX, noted that Musk's official government service ended in May. Taylor Lauber will succeed Isaacman as CEO of Shift4, while Isaacman will assume the role of executive chairman.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister assured Greece that Egypt will safeguard the spiritual and religious significance of Saint Catherine's Monastery. This commitment follows an Egyptian court ruling that raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's ownership claims. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area, despite ruling that the land is public. Established in the sixth century, Saint Catherine's Monastery is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery and holds a vast collection of ancient manuscripts.</p>
