          <p>After more than four decades of conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its armed struggle against the Turkish government, initiating a disarmament process. This move, prompted by a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, is seen as a major opportunity for peace, though significant hurdles remain. The PKK is demanding concessions, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms, while the Turkish government remains cautious. Analysts are optimistic that this process could improve Turkey's regional relationships and domestic stability.</p>

          <p>Construction workers installing a water pipeline in Dubrovnik, Croatia, have discovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat buried beneath the seabed. The find was made in the historic Old Town harbor, a location famously used for filming the series "Game of Thrones." A marine archaeologist confirmed the vessel is over 225 years old based on radiocarbon dating analysis. The remains are now being protected for further examination, adding to a series of recent maritime archaeological discoveries across Europe.</p>

          <p>In response to a challenging business climate, high-end hotels in China are adopting unconventional survival strategies, such as selling low-cost street food. For example, a five-star hotel in Changzhou began offering budget-friendly meal boxes, including popular night market dishes, prepared by its own catering team. This pivot from expensive banquets to affordable takeaway meals reflects a broader trend of businesses adapting to shifting consumer behavior and economic pressures. The hotel's manager stated that solving the immediate problem of survival is the top priority.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the Live Aid concert is remembered as a landmark event that united nearly two billion people and raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, it set a new precedent for global charity events. However, the concert has also faced enduring criticism for its lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers on its main stages. Critics argue it reinforced a "white savior" narrative and a simplistic view of Africa's challenges, sparking a long-running debate about its complex legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A campaign is growing in the UK to require cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the currently used Latin-based nomenclature. Advocates, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue that the scientific names are unrecognizable to most consumers, putting those with allergies at serious risk. One mother shared how her daughter had an allergic reaction to a body wash because the allergen was not clearly listed. Campaigners are pushing for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to food products.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study offers evidence that could counter fears in India about China's dam construction on the Brahmaputra river, known as the Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet. Contrary to concerns that a new mega-dam could cause droughts, the study analyzed data from two existing upstream dams. The findings, measured since 2014, show that these dams have actually increased water flow downstream during the dry season. Low flows in February were up by more than 50%, suggesting that dam operations are augmenting water levels when they are typically at their lowest.</p>
