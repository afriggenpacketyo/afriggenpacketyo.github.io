        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Top trade officials from the United States and China have concluded talks in Stockholm, agreeing in principle to extend a pause on tariff escalations. However, U.S. negotiators, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, emphasized that any formal extension requires final approval from President Donald Trump. The current 90-day truce is set to expire on August 12, after which tariffs could revert to higher levels if no agreement is reached. The discussions did not cover the social media app TikTok, as officials stated they are keeping trade and national security matters separate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a suggestion from President Trump, Senator Josh Hawley has introduced legislation to send tariff rebate checks to American families. The proposed American Worker Rebate Act would provide payments of at least $600 per person, funded by revenue from the administration's import tariffs. While proponents argue it returns money to hardworking Americans, the idea faces skepticism from some fiscal conservatives concerned about the national deficit. Critics also warn that such rebates could exacerbate inflationary pressures, similar to stimulus checks issued during the pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester City has re-signed 22-year-old goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley in a deal reported to be a new record transfer fee for a British goalkeeper. While City sources state the fee is £27 million plus add-ons, Burnley sources claim it is £31 million, which would surpass the previous record. Trafford, a graduate of City's academy, returns to the club after an impressive season with Burnley, signing a five-year contract. He will now compete with long-time first-choice keeper Ederson for the starting position at the Premier League club.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals a tight three-way race among potential successors to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh each received 24% of the vote from respondents, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett close behind at 22%. While President Trump has been critical of Powell, 84% of survey participants believe he will not be fired before his term ends in May 2026. The survey also indicated that political pressure on the Fed is seen as making interest rate cuts less, not more, likely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a changing economic landscape, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account this August may still be a beneficial strategy for savers. While top CD rates are no longer at their peak, they remain competitive in the 4% to 4.5% range, offering a solid return on a significant deposit. With no Federal Reserve meeting in August, savers have a window of stability to lock in these rates before a potential rate cut in September. Given the high probability of a rate reduction this fall, this period could represent a final opportunity to secure a higher, fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor. The lawsuit alleged that the university permitted antisemitic discrimination during pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, where protesters allegedly blocked Jewish students from accessing parts of the campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA admitted it had "fallen short" and will fund Jewish community support groups and a campus initiative to combat antisemitism. The university still faces a separate lawsuit from pro-Palestinian protesters who allege negligence during a violent counter-protest.</p>

          <p>Italy's federation of woodworking and furniture industries, FederlegnoArredo, is urging the Italian government and the European Commission to finalize a trade agreement with the South American bloc, Mercosur. The industry group argues that removing tariffs with Mercosur nations, including Brazil, would create significant export opportunities and help offset the impact of the new 15% U.S. tariffs on EU goods. Discussions for an EU-Mercosur deal have been ongoing for over two decades, with a draft agreement announced in 2019 but not yet ratified. Proponents say the deal would save EU companies billions in export duties annually. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Scotland, First Minister John Swinney urged him to exempt scotch whisky from a 10% U.S. tariff that is reportedly costing the industry millions weekly. The two leaders held formal and informal discussions at Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort, where Swinney made his case. The First Minister expressed cautious optimism, stating he believes there is now a "window of opportunity" for the president to reconsider the specific tariff. The issue was not addressed in the broader U.S.-U.K. trade deal signed in June, leaving the iconic Scottish export subject to the levy.</p>
