          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, including Hong Kong, Japan, and mainland China, experienced gains on Monday as investors processed the latest economic data out of China. China's GDP rose 4.8% in the third quarter, aligning with analyst expectations, and its benchmark lending rates remained unchanged, consistent with forecasts. Despite this moderate growth and earlier credit concerns in the U.S., American markets also closed higher last Friday, influenced by a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China. This article highlights a broader regional market resilience and positive investor sentiment amidst specific economic indicators, suggesting a cautious but stable financial outlook.

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking an end to two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) rule. Paz, an economist, campaigned on promises to open Bolivia to the world and restore its role, inheriting a country grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades, including a severe shortage of U.S. dollars and high inflation. Both Paz and his conservative opponent pledged to stabilize the economy and attract foreign investment, signifying a seismic shift in Bolivia's political and economic trajectory.</p>

          <p>An operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District resulted in 13 arrests for alleged pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activities, initially sparking widespread concern about a possible ICE raid. Social media posts warned of federal immigration agents, particularly at a renowned gay bar, showing people cursing at law enforcement. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials later confirmed that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved, clarifying that local law enforcement conducted the operation. The article highlights the community's heightened anxiety regarding immigration enforcement and the actual nature of the arrests.</p>

          <p>The University of Connecticut is warning students and staff about a concerning rise in tick-borne illnesses, including Lyme disease and the dangerous Powassan virus, on campus. Researchers note that warmer winters are extending tick activity year-round, increasing health risks, and that thousands of students in one area make campuses particularly vulnerable. UConn Extension and CVMDL are actively educating the community on prevention and expanding testing capabilities, as these diseases can cause severe, long-term health issues if left untreated. The article emphasizes the growing public health challenge posed by climate change-influenced tick populations.</p>

          <h2>LiDAR Maker Founder Challenges Elon Musk's Vision-Only Approach for Self-Driving Safety</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, argues that a multi-sensor system is inherently safer for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu contends that vision-only systems struggle with "corner cases," like distinguishing a white car from a cloud or a black car in a tunnel, making Level 3 or 4 automation unachievable without additional sensors like LiDAR. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and performance improvements in the technology. The article outlines a key debate in autonomous vehicle development, with other auto executives also favoring LiDAR.</p>

          <p>Decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of General Robert E. Lee, have been transformed into a thought-provoking art exhibit in Los Angeles, displayed alongside contemporary art pieces. The exhibit aims to challenge the "Lost Cause" ideology, which romanticizes the Confederacy and downplays its connection to slavery, by recontextualizing these symbols. Curator Hamza Walker and artist Kara Walker seek to provoke a rethinking of these figures as mythological holders of white supremacy. This article highlights a significant cultural and political statement, contrasting with President Trump's call to reinstall such monuments and reflecting ongoing debates about American history and racial justice.</p>
