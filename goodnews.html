          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to secure votes for the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a megabill aimed at advancing President Trump's legislative agenda. Johnson faces pressure from conservatives and moderates, needing to reconcile concerns about Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Trump is willing to assist Johnson, potentially calling Republican members to encourage support for the bill. The House Rules Committee will hold a hearing to set parameters for floor debate, with Johnson aiming for passage by the Fourth of July to address the debt limit. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration's takeover of the United States Institute of Peace, reinstating the fired board members and president. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that Trump exceeded his authority by attempting to dismantle the organization and seize its assets. The court determined that USIP is part of the federal government but not the executive branch, making Trump's actions unlawful. The ruling voids transfers of assets, including the institute's headquarters, and criticizes the administration's actions as a gross usurpation of power.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed the Take It Down Act into law, criminalizing the posting of "intimate images," both real and AI-generated, online without consent. The law requires technology companies to remove such content within 48 hours. First Lady Melania Trump championed the bill, emphasizing the need to protect children from malicious online behavior. While receiving bipartisan support, digital rights groups warn the law is too broad and could lead to censorship of legitimate content, including legal pornography, LGBTQ+ content, and government criticism.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reviews key moments from the 50th season of "Saturday Night Live," which was marked by anniversary celebrations and new episodes covering a contentious presidential election. Maya Rudolph's Kamala Harris impression was noted as lackluster, while Dana Carvey's Biden and Mike Myers's Elon Musk were highlights. A sketch featuring bridesmaids singing about "Domingo" became a viral phenomenon, leading to multiple appearances. The anniversary special delivered a classic SNL experience, and Ego Nwodim's "Weekend Update" segment as Miss Eggy was memorable. </p>

          <p>Israel has acquired 2,500 documents and personal effects belonging to Eli Cohen, a famous Israeli spy executed in Syria in 1965, according to a New York Times article. The Mossad, with the help of a foreign government, retrieved the trove, including documents, photographs, and handwritten letters. Cohen's intelligence work in Syria in the early 1960s provided crucial information that helped Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967. The announcement comes after President Trump met with the Syrian president, urging improved relations with Israel.</p>

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings for violating rules, as it seeks to address a housing crisis. The listings either lacked licenses, had fake license numbers, or failed to disclose whether the property was run by a corporation or an individual. Housing affordability has become a critical issue in Spain, where mass demonstrations have been held by people who say real estate investors and tourist accommodations have pushed families from their homes. The government aims to ensure that economic interests do not take precedence over the right to housing.</p>

          <p>The article discusses what 100% home equity means for homeowners and their borrowing options. Having 100% equity means your mortgage balance is paid off, but lenders typically limit borrowing to 80%-90% of the home's value. With 100% equity, homeowners are positioned for better rates and terms due to being less risky borrowers. The article compares home equity loans and HELOCs, noting that HELOCs may be more attractive due to lower rates and potential for future rate cuts, while home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates.</p>

          <p>The article explores whether tax relief can help with past-due debt owed to the IRS. The IRS offers programs like Offers in Compromise, Installment Agreements, and Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status to help taxpayers manage or reduce their debt. These programs can reduce the total amount owed, pause collection efforts, or make payments more manageable. However, relief doesn't mean forgiveness, and taxpayers must stay compliant with future tax obligations. The article also warns against tax relief scams.</p>
