          <p>The long-running succession dispute within the Murdoch family's media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. Under the arrangement, Lachlan's more politically moderate siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will sell their holdings and cease to be beneficiaries of the trust controlling Fox and News Corp. This resolution ends all litigation over the family trust, effectively buying out dissenting voices for a reported $1.1 billion each.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have experienced a substantial drop, with the average 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.12% ahead of an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline follows a slide in Treasury yields, a key benchmark for mortgage rates. Economists note that the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields has narrowed, suggesting a favorable trend for borrowers. While the Fed's decision is pending, the market has already priced in a high probability of a rate cut, providing some relief for the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are experiencing a significant surge in applications as the political climate in the U.S. shifts. According to former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum, Black students are actively seeking affirming and inclusive educational environments where their history is valued rather than erased. This trend is driven by a societal backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and racial progress. While the increased interest is a positive development for these institutions, they face the challenge of providing sufficient financial aid to meet the needs of all applicants.</p>
