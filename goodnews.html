          <p>During a game against the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. executed a remarkable defensive play. After catching a deep fly ball in right field, he made a powerful and precise throw to third base to get a runner out, completing an inning-ending double play. The throw was widely praised by his manager and teammates for its accuracy and strength, and it proved pivotal in preventing the Yankees from a potential game-tying rally. Acuña attributed the play to his focus on anticipating game situations.</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Thymen Arensman secured his first stage victory in the Tour de France during a challenging mountain stage in the Pyrenees.

Meanwhile, overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his advantage over Jonas Vingegaard by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of Vingegaard in third.

          <p>In front of a sold-out home crowd, British athletes Georgia Hunter Bell, Charlie Dobson, and Morgan Lake each claimed victories at the London Diamond League. Hunter Bell won the women's 800m with a season's best time, while Dobson achieved a personal best to win the men's 400m. Morgan Lake secured first place in the women's high jump. The event also saw a strong second-place finish for world 1500m champion Josh Kerr, who was narrowly beaten by Kenyan teenager Phanuel Kipkosgei Koech.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is making a surprisingly swift recovery from a left knee bone bruise sustained earlier this month. Initially expected to miss about six weeks, Muncy is already running and taking swings, with manager Dave Roberts suggesting his return will be much sooner than anticipated. Muncy described himself as incredibly lucky, as doctors told him a millisecond difference in the timing of the injury could have required surgery. His return is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled in his absence.</p>

          <p>Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team was officially awarded their world championship gold medals at the London Diamond League meeting, 28 years after the event. The team was upgraded from silver after the original winners, the United States, were disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The athletes received a warm reception from the 60,000-strong crowd during the belated ceremony. The presentation concluded a long process of investigation and reallocation by World Athletics.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the Butts County Sheriff's Office in Georgia has led to charges against 22 people and over 100 warrants in a drug bust dubbed "Operation Oxy Moron." The operation centered on Reynard Stewart, who allegedly bought prescription medications like Oxycodone and Adderall from individuals and then illegally redistributed them. Authorities uncovered a significant operation involving multiple substances, including cocaine and fentanyl, with one person reportedly spending $36,000 with Stewart since the start of the year. Several suspects remain at large as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a largely positive week, buoyed by strong corporate earnings and moderating inflation data, despite concerns over potential new tariffs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw gains, driven by key sectors like technology. Inflation reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), came in slightly below expectations, easing some fears about aggressive Federal Reserve action. However, persistent shelter costs and tariff uncertainty remain concerns, suggesting the Fed may maintain current interest rates for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Author and entrepreneur Scott Galloway asserts that the advice to "follow your passion" is the worst career guidance given by billionaires, as they are already wealthy. Instead, he advocates for finding an intersection between one's talents and what is financially lucrative. Galloway shares his own journey from a low-income background to becoming a self-made millionaire, emphasizing that his success came from identifying his strengths and enduring rejection, not just following a passion. The article suggests that a practical approach, combined with a growth mindset, is more effective for building a successful career.</p>

          <p>Financial experts argue that focusing solely on a specific net worth figure can be a misleading way to gauge financial comfort. While a recent survey found Americans believe they need an average net worth of $839,000 to feel comfortable, planners say this metric is just a snapshot in time. They suggest that true financial well-being is better measured by cash flow and whether one's financial habits align with their personal values and goals. Rather than chasing a number, experts advise focusing on what money can provide, such as security or freedom.</p>
