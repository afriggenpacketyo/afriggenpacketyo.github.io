          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 meeting in Canada, aiming to address ongoing tariff disputes. Prior to the summit, Japan's tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will visit Washington for further negotiations to bridge the gap over Trump's tariff policy, as previous rounds have failed to resolve the differences. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, including a 10 percent baseline levy and a 14 percent country-specific portion. Tokyo is considering accepting reduced tariff rates as the U.S. has consistently refused to eliminate the duties, with both countries aiming to reach a deal promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address the elevated prices of the staple food. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to be sold at 1,700 yen ($12) per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, following previous releases through auctions. The government aims to deliver the stockpiled rice quickly to smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops to lower prices for consumers, as rice has been in short supply and prices have doubled compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline" in world fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners. The UNFPA surveyed 14,000 people across 14 countries, finding that one in five have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to having children, with infertility being a less common reason. The report marks a shift in the UN's focus towards low fertility issues, as the agency previously focused on women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdose risk among those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl and other drugs killed approximately 16,690 people under 35 in 2024, a sharp decline from 31,000 in 2021. Experts attribute this trend to factors like wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare access, and safer drug choices among teens. While the improvement is dramatic, some clusters of young people still experience an uptick in deaths, underscoring the need for continued vigilance and support for addiction services.</p>
