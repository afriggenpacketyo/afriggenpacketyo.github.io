          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film chronicling Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay against Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, after discovering she was paid 40% less than her male colleagues. Clarkson describes Ledbetter as a remarkable human being and a true American hero who faced misogyny and ageism. The article highlights Ledbetter's struggle, her Supreme Court loss, and the eventual passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which ended the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims. Clarkson reflects on the universal struggles of equal pay and how her own mother inspired her performance, emphasizing the importance of striving to be a better human being and citizen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad, aiming to reduce net migration by up to 50,000 lower-skilled workers over the next year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that firms will be required to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The government also intends to raise the threshold for skilled visas and introduce new training commitments to boost domestic labor participation. The new rules will require care companies to prove they attempted to recruit a worker from within England first before hiring from abroad.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to alleviate inflation, citing concerns about the significant reduction in state revenue. While senior officials in his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have been hesitant about lowering the consumption tax, currently at 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items, the coalition government is considering an economic package in anticipation of the House of Councillors election this summer. The government is trying to balance addressing inflation with maintaining fiscal stability.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American parents are building their family lives around friendships, seeking support and community in a country that lacks structural support for families. This involves creating villages of chosen families, where friends live close to one another and share child-care responsibilities. While it requires coordination and can lead to conflicts, this approach offers much-needed support and deeper friendships, challenging the traditional notion of isolated nuclear families. By embracing alloparenting and remixing tradition, these families are finding innovative ways to navigate the challenges of parenthood.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of the developing trade agreement between the UK and the Trump administration. The deal aims to provide certainty to the ¬£40 billion aerospace sector, supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The agreement also benefits the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners. This follows relief for the car and steel industries in the US-UK deal, with car tariffs potentially reduced and steel tariffs eliminated.</p>

The concept gained traction over the years and is now widely used in basketball at all levels, including the NBA and college.
