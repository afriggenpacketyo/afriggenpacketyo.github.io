          <p>The Federal Reserve maintained its key interest rate at 4.25%-4.5%, defying President Trump's calls for cuts.  The decision comes amidst expectations of higher inflation (3%) and slower economic growth (1.4% GDP).  The Fed's dot plot still projects two rate cuts by the end of 2025, but uncertainty remains among officials regarding the future path of rates.  The committee's decision reflects a cautious approach, awaiting further economic clarity before adjusting policies.</p>

The decision reflects a balance between maintaining low inflation, a healthy job market, and acknowledging economic uncertainty.

Calculations show significant interest earnings depending on the deposit amount (e.g., $46.60 on $1,000 at 4.66%).  The fixed rate and early withdrawal penalties encourage savers to maintain their deposits, unlike other variable-rate accounts. (not investment advice)</p>
