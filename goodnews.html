          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned six leaders and affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its head, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, known as "Niño Guerrero." This action aims to disrupt the gang's expanding influence and extensive criminal activities across the Western Hemisphere, which include murder, human trafficking, sexual exploitation, kidnapping, and narcotics. The State Department offers rewards for information leading to their arrest or conviction. The Trump administration previously labeled Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, emphasizing continued efforts to dismantle the group and its campaign of violence to enhance community safety.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking decades since its 1955 opening. The park, which revolutionized the amusement industry with immersive attractions, remains the world's second-most visited theme park. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, Disneyland has continually evolved, adding new attractions like Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and expanding its Southern California footprint. The article highlights the park's enduring emphasis on storytelling and attention to detail, noting the significant increase in ticket prices over time and its importance as a successful business segment for Walt Disney Co.</p>

          <p>Organizers of Belgium's Tomorrowland festival are rushing to build a new main stage after a fire completely destroyed the original platform. The festival, expecting 400,000 attendees over two weekends, will proceed with a two-hour delay on Friday, with or without a new stage. If a new stage isn't ready, the event will open at reduced capacity, with main stage artists performing at the campsite's Gathering Stage. No injuries were reported from the Wednesday evening fire, and investigations into its cause are ongoing, as attendees express determination to enjoy the event.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. banks are reporting strong second-quarter profits, driven by a surge in stock and bond trading and increased corporate transactions. Despite initial market shock from President Trump's tariffs, investors have adapted, leading to a "soft landing" economic scenario with reduced recession fears. JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, saw significant profit and investment banking fee growth, reflecting corporate confidence. The article suggests that Trump's spending bill, preserved corporate tax rates, and deregulation are contributing to this favorable environment for banks and a resilient U.S. economy (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son were rescued from a remote California forest after getting lost en route to a Boy Scouts camp and leaving "HELP" notes. Their GPS had led them onto old logging roads where they lost signal and got stuck about 10 miles from the nearest paved road. A volunteer search-and-rescue team located them after finding their notes and hearing from campers who had seen their car. Authorities praised the pair for staying put, packing provisions, and the son using his Scout-taught whistle signal, crediting their actions for their successful rescue.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece praises the recent budget bill for repealing some green-energy subsidies from the Inflation Reduction Act, calling it a positive step despite not going as far as desired. The author argues that such subsidies distort the tax code and foster cronyism, advocating for an end to all private-sector subsidies, including lingering fossil-fuel ones. The article highlights that green energy historically receives significantly higher subsidies than fossil fuels, emphasizing that even a partial rollback of $500 billion in savings demonstrates that policy reform against special interests is achievable.</p>
