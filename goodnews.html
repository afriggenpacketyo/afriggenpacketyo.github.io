          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite not playing their best baseball, secured a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals, moving into sole possession of the best record in MLB at 52-31. Manager Dave Roberts noted the team's inconsistent play, yet they managed to compensate for shortcomings like a short start from Dustin May and limited hits. Key offensive plays included Shohei Ohtani's leadoff blast and game-tying triple, alongside Max Muncy's two-run homer. The bullpen's five scoreless frames and a game-ending double play in the ninth sealed the win, highlighting the team's current ability to achieve success even without a flawless performance.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated the club has no intention of selling 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from several English and European clubs. Acheampong, who signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season under Maresca, is reportedly not frustrated at Chelsea. Maresca views him as a potential top defender for the club, indicating that any loan move would only occur if mutually agreed upon for his development. The long-term plan is for Acheampong to remain and thrive at Stamford Bridge, reinforcing the club's commitment to nurturing young talent and building for the future.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas on loan to Adventure World amusement park in Wakayama Prefecture, Japan, departed for China on Saturday, ahead of their lease expiration. This departure, including 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring, leaves only two pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, which are also slated to return to China next February. About 1,400 visitors queued for their final display, and 3,000 attended a farewell ceremony, expressing sadness but also hope to visit them in China. The Wakayama zoo, which successfully raised 17 cubs, concluded its breeding project for now but expressed willingness to accept new pandas in the future, highlighting the strong cooperation ties between China and Japan in conservation.</p>

          <p>A study by the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates that a traditional Japanese-style diet, including rice, miso soup, and fish, may lower the rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted on 12,499 employees, found that those adhering to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after isolating other potential influencing factors. The institute suggests that certain foods like seaweed, soy products, and omega-3 rich fish contribute to improved well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. This first-of-its-kind study hopes to inform public health measures for depression prevention in workplaces and other areas.</p>

          <p>Antoine Massey, one of ten inmates who escaped the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago, has been arrested in New Orleans, leaving only one fugitive at large. Massey was taken into custody peacefully at a residence, marking a significant development in what Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called the worst jailbreak in recent state history. The inmates escaped by exploiting a faulty cell door, removing a toilet, and scaling a barbed wire fence. State and local officials have criticized Sheriff Susan Hutson's management, while authorities have arrested at least 16 people for aiding the escapees. A $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final fugitive's arrest.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning dark comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by real-life sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, returns with a new series that promises to be "more depressing, but maybe more funny." The show follows sisters Josie and Billie and their mum Deb as they navigate financial struggles and relationship challenges, often through "twisted schemes" and taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. Sadler, the writer, draws inspiration from their all-woman upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene, satirizing the societal pressure to avoid being single. The sisters express pride in tackling sensitive topics with their unique, dark humor, aiming to "skewer" topical issues and portray a more nuanced reality of women's lives.</p>

Miki Deguchi, a farmer in Kasugai, believes the nutrient-packed plant, rich in minerals and fiber, has a mild, refreshing taste and can even be eaten uncooked. Research at Chubu University confirmed its health benefits, including elevated mucin levels and enhanced immune function in mice fed cactus pear powder. Experts see edible cactus as a promising solution for global food security and climate change challenges, with the UN also highlighting its potential to thrive in dry, drought-prone areas, providing food and fodder.</p>

          <p>A BBC health correspondent successfully identified a "bacteria-eating virus," or bacteriophage, from a toilet sample, demonstrating the surprising ease of finding these potential microbial saviors. This discovery is part of the Phage Collection Project, which aims to find new ways to treat infections, including superbugs resistant to modern antibiotics. The correspondent's phage, named Gallagher-phage, proved highly effective in killing a troublesome urinary tract infection bacteria in the lab. While phage therapy is an old idea, it's gaining renewed interest as antibiotic resistance becomes a "silent pandemic" with projected annual deaths of 10 million by 2050. New UK regulations are now supporting its development for patient use, offering hope against untreatable infections.</p>

This pioneering satellite, 20 years in the making, uses a unique P-band radar frequency to measure woody material and estimate carbon storage, crucial for understanding rainforests' role in mitigating climate change. The initial breathtaking images show concealed deforestation and terrain, allowing authorities to react more swiftly to illegal logging. The ultimate goal is a global 3D forest map, enhancing efforts to protect these vital ecosystems, which cover only 6% of the world's land but host half its species and store billions of tonnes of planet-warming gases.</p>

Her generous act of presenting the paintings to her classmates evoked rave reviews and some remorse from students who wished they had interacted more. Schafer hopes her experience teaches others, both students and adults, that reaching out and trying to connect can bridge perceived social gaps, emphasizing that much of social isolation is "all in your head."</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey, marking the fourth such ruling against his campaign to punish elite law firms. Judge Loren AliKhan declared the order "unconstitutional from beginning to end," citing violations of First and Fifth Amendment rights and a broader assault on the American legal system. Trump's orders sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts for firms representing opposing causes or employing disliked attorneys. These consistent judicial rebukes, from judges appointed by both parties, underscore the courts' defense of an independent bar and the rule of law against executive overreach.</p>

Frontman Matty Healy, while expressing nervousness, showcased his verbose lyrics and the band's tight musicality, blending digital textures with rock and 80s influences. Despite Healy's self-proclaimed status as a "generational poet," the performance mostly stuck to hits, with only "People" showing untamed energy. Notably, the band steered clear of politics, with Healy stating a desire for their legacy to be "love and friendships" rather than political, a significant shift that may influence their forthcoming sixth album and future performances.</p>
