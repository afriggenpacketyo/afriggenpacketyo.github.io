          <p>During a traffic stop in Springfield Township, Ohio, police discovered a pet raccoon named Chewy in the front seat of a car with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth. The officers initially pulled over Victoria Vidal, 55, due to an active warrant and a suspended driver's license. A subsequent search of the vehicle revealed a large amount of methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and drug paraphernalia. Chewy was unharmed and taken into protective custody, while Vidal faces multiple drug possession charges. Police noted the incident was an unexpected turn of events.</p>

          <p>Street sex workers in Bristol are working with police and a charity through the Night Light initiative to provide vital information on child exploitation, helping to bring child sex offenders to justice and identify children at risk. These women have built trust with authorities and share information about dangerous men and at-risk youth. One woman's testimony led to the imprisonment of a man who was abusing his daughter, while another reported a man showing child abuse photos, leading to his arrest. The sex workers are also provided with support, food, and clothing by the initiative, helping them feel proud of safeguarding other girls.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Joe Biden criticized Donald Trump's approach to international relations, particularly Trump's treatment of America's allies and his pressure on Ukraine. Biden expressed concern over the future of the Atlantic Alliance and the potential for Europe to lose confidence in American leadership. He also condemned Trump's comments about acquiring Greenland and annexing Canada, stating that such behavior is not representative of American values. Biden emphasized the importance of freedom, democracy, and opportunity, rather than confiscation.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military has reclassified Chiang Kai-shek's mausoleum in Taoyuan as a "camp area," marking the latest effort by the island's pro-independence authorities to diminish the legacy of the former Kuomintang (KMT) leader. The mausoleum of Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was also reclassified similarly. The sites will no longer be referred to as "mausoleums" or "spirit-worship facilities." The military stated that the changes reflect updated administrative needs and the 2014 reclassification of Taoyuan as a metropolitan area.</p>

The film, made with the cooperation of an exhibition hall dedicated to the unit in Harbin, is set to be released on the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese conflict. The Japanese government is concerned about the film's potential negative impact on bilateral ties, fearing it could reignite historical disputes.

          <p>Morocco is becoming an increasingly important hub for Chinese companies seeking to circumvent tariffs for exports to Europe, particularly in the automotive sector. Chinese investment in Morocco has exploded in recent years, with billions of dollars directed towards energy, electric vehicles, and battery production. However, this growing relationship creates a difficult balancing act for Morocco, as tensions between China and the United States and Europe sharpen. Morocco's strategic partnership with the U.S. remains a priority, leading to a delicate situation as it seeks to benefit from Chinese investment without alienating Western allies.</p>
