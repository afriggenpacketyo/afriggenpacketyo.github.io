          <h2>Six Ways to Build Trust With Your Child</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist suggests six daily practices for parents to cultivate trust with their children, emphasizing open communication and emotional modeling. The practices include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, and being honest about personal challenges. Instead of interrogating children, parents should model emotional awareness by sharing aspects of their own day. Incorporating real talk into family routines, like sharing highs and lows at dinner, and teaching coping strategies are also important. Trust is built through consistent, small moments of connection and vulnerability.</p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and calling for global unity, has gained significant attention, especially following the Trump administration's pledge to intensify screening and potentially revoke student visas for Chinese nationals. Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker at a Harvard graduation ceremony, delivered her emotional speech on the same day a federal judge blocked a Department of Homeland Security order seeking to prevent the Ivy League university from enrolling international students. The US State Department's recent announcement to aggressively revoke student visas for Chinese nationals is widely believed to stem from Washington‚Äôs concerns about espionage activities that could bolster Beijing‚Äôs military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark. The developers suggest potential applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, though some critics question their practicality compared to existing night vision devices.</p>

Paul, on the other hand, displayed toughness and consistency, saving 10 break points and capitalizing on Popyrin's mistakes.

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry over nine years to support security-related technology research. This funding has become an important source for researchers amid declining operational subsidies to national universities and a decreasing student population. The subsidy program began in fiscal year 2015 with a budget of 300 million yen and has expanded to include large-scale research projects. Some universities are working on projects such as developing sheets that absorb harmful gases and AI systems for detecting cyberattacks.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order that cut federal funding to what President Trump described as "biased media". The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech by targeting NPR for its news coverage. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, as Trump's administration has been open about targeting media organizations it believes have reported negatively on the president. The outcome of the lawsuit could have significant implications for press freedom in the United States.</p>

The series delves into the struggles of Rabbi L√©a Schmoll as she navigates the nihilism of contemporary society and the rigidity of Orthodox traditions. Through interpretation and creative engagement, L√©a finds ways to give sense to rituals and make them relevant to her congregants. The show explores the tension between tradition and modernity, questioning whether religion can still have purpose for those who don't believe.</p>
