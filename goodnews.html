          <p>China is planning to create 10 new national data pilot zones in regions including Beijing, Zhejiang, and Anhui, according to an announcement by the National Data Administration (NDA). This initiative aims to strengthen the country's digital economy and enhance its competitiveness in artificial intelligence against the United States. These zones will focus on fostering data-related market entities and expanding the data market. The sector's market size had surpassed 2 trillion yuan ($US278.4 billion), with the figure projected to rise to 7.5 trillion yuan by 2030. The move is part of a three-year action plan to double data transactions and promote data usage across various sectors, indicating a strategic push towards digital dominance.

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, coupled with weak domestic demand, is leading to a potential 'China shock' in global markets. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts, causing concern in other Asian economies about a flood of cheap imports. However, economists suggest that this influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in inflation-worn economies. This may allow central banks to consider further rate cuts to stimulate growth amidst rising trade tensions. Optimism score is 65.</p>
