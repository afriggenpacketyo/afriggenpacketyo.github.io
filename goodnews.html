          <p>China is expanding its strategic focus on Latin America, with observers noting that solid China-Latin America ties would be "unstoppable" if the U.S. continues its current approach. This follows the China-Celac Forum, where President Xi Jinping offered a $9.2 billion credit line to support development in the region. Infrastructure is expected to remain a key sector for Beijing's engagement, countering U.S. influence amidst global trade wars and tensions over the Panama Canal. China positions itself as a good friend and partner, promoting a multipolar world in the face of unilateralism, a veiled critique of the White House. The move towards multilateralism is a positive sign.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults outlines five straightforward parenting rules: trust your instincts, follow your culture, observe your child, focus on enjoyment, and be authentic. The advice encourages parents to rely on their innate abilities and cultural traditions rather than overcomplicating parenting with excessive information. The psychiatrist emphasizes the importance of understanding each child's unique interests and fostering enjoyment in activities, rather than solely focusing on development. The guidance suggests that a parent's love and attention are more valuable than striving for perfection. The tips offered are helpful for parents.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a rare chordoma on her brain stem, was found to have a second tumor on her spine during an MRI. Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye, a first-of-its-kind procedure. The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor, which was then carefully dissected. Flores has since undergone radiation treatment and is now cancer-free, highlighting the success of this innovative approach. The patient's success story illustrates the potential for medical innovation to overcome significant health challenges.</p>
