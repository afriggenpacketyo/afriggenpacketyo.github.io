          <p>The House Oversight Committee has withdrawn its subpoena compelling former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. This decision was made after the committee learned of significant health issues that prevent the 81-year-old from appearing. Mueller's family recently confirmed to The New York Times that he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2021. The subpoena was part of a broader investigation into the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein case during Mueller's tenure as FBI Director.</p>

          <p>A recent solar eruption is expected to create a vibrant display of the northern lights, potentially visible across 18 U.S. states from late Monday into early Tuesday. The phenomenon, caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun interacting with Earth's magnetic field, offers a rare viewing opportunity for many. While not anticipated to be as intense as the major geomagnetic storms of 2024, forecasters suggest it will be one of the best chances to see the aurora since the spring. For optimal viewing, experts recommend finding a dark location away from city lights.</p>

          <p>A Polish CEO, Piotr Szczerek, has publicly apologized after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy from tennis player Kamil Majchrzak went viral. Szczerek claimed it was a "huge mistake" and that he was convinced the player was passing the hat to him, not the child. He has since returned the hat to the boy, and Majchrzak also met with the young fan to give him another cap and other merchandise. The incident occurred after Majchrzak's second-round victory at the US Open.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper in an effort to encourage more commuters to use trains instead of cars. This move follows a pilot program and will result in savings of nearly 50% on key routes like Edinburgh to Glasgow. The Scottish government, which owns ScotRail, anticipates the policy will cost between £40 million and £45 million annually. While a previous evaluation noted limited success in boosting ridership enough to be self-financing, officials are framing it as a crucial investment in public transport and affordability.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Best CD Terms for Savers in September</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 09:15:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As interest rates show signs of decline, financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently offer the most attractive returns for savers. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," providing high yields without locking up funds for an extended period. While longer-term CDs historically offered better rates, the current inverted yield curve makes shorter terms more lucrative. For those with a longer time horizon, experts still recommend a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading investments across various term lengths to lock in current high rates while maintaining periodic access to funds.

          <h2>Founder Advocates for 'Sustainable Ambition' to Prevent Professional Burnout</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 09:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two-time startup founder Amanda Goetz is promoting a concept she calls "sustainable ambition" to help high-achievers avoid burnout. After experiencing severe panic attacks from juggling her career and single parenthood, Goetz realized the danger of "toxic grit," which she defines as relentless hustle without intention. Her strategy involves intentionally scheduling cycles of hard work followed by periods of "proactive rest," rather than working until exhaustion forces a break. She suggests this rhythm allows for reprioritizing different areas of life, asserting that one can "have it all, just not all at once."</p>

          <h2>Novo Nordisk's Wegovy Shows Superior Heart Risk Reduction in New Study</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 09:10:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New real-world study data indicates that Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy provides a significantly greater reduction in the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death compared to its main rival, Eli Lilly's Zepbound. The study found a 57% greater risk reduction for Wegovy users with obesity and cardiovascular disease. This news provides a boost for the Danish pharmaceutical company, which has faced market challenges in the U.S. due to competition and pricing pressures. The findings suggest the heart-protective benefits may be specific to Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide, and not a general class effect of GLP-1 drugs.</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight the Challenge of Weight Loss Amid Pervasive Ultra-Processed Foods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 09:02:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts are emphasizing the difficulty of losing weight due to the prevalence of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in the typical American diet. UPFs, which undergo industrial processing and contain additives, include obvious items like sugary cereals and frozen meals, but also less apparent ones like flavored oatmeal, mass-produced bread, and most cold cuts. A recent study found that adults who eliminated UPFs lost nearly twice as much weight as those who did not. Nutritionists advise consumers to become more informed by checking ingredient lists for additives like corn syrup and prioritizing whole, minimally processed foods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices remaining resilient near record highs, investors are considering how to best incorporate the precious metal into their portfolios for stability. Financial experts suggest the ideal investment type depends on individual goals. Physical gold, such as coins and bullion, is recommended for those prioritizing long-term wealth preservation and who can manage secure storage. Gold ETFs offer greater liquidity and are more suitable for investors wanting easy access and diversification. For those with a higher risk tolerance, gold mining stocks can offer greater returns but require thorough research into company-specific operational risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Iowa Nuclear Plant Pursues Restart to Meet Surging Demand from AI Data Centers</h2>

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, which shut down in 2020, is moving forward with plans to restart operations by the late 2020s. The revival is driven by soaring electricity demand from new data centers being built to power artificial intelligence. The plant's owner, NextEra Energy, has received federal approval to reconnect to the grid and is seeking a power purchase agreement with a major tech company. This marks the third mothballed U.S. nuclear reactor to seek a restart, signaling a potential resurgence for the industry as it finds new life in fueling the energy-intensive tech sector.</p>

          <p>Meta is introducing additional safety measures for its AI chatbots to prevent them from discussing sensitive topics like suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders with teenage users. Instead of engaging on these subjects, the chatbots will now direct teens to expert resources. The move follows an investigation launched by a U.S. senator after a leaked document suggested the AI could have inappropriate chats with minors. This update comes amid broader concerns about the potential for AI chatbots to mislead or harm vulnerable users, with Meta stating the new guardrails are being added as an extra precaution.</p>

          <p>With artificial intelligence challenging traditional methods of teaching and assessment, this article explores how higher education should adapt. While some advocate for prioritizing STEM and AI-related skills, many tech leaders are surprisingly advising the opposite, arguing that AI will automate technical tasks. They suggest the most valuable future skills will be uniquely human ones like empathy, critical judgment, and self-awareness, which are best cultivated through a liberal arts education. This piece posits that engaging with foundational texts and ideas strengthens attention and fosters wisdom, qualities that are resistant to the shortcuts offered by AI.</p>
