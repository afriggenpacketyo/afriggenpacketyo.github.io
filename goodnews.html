          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei addressed the impact of U.S. sanctions on the company's technology, particularly in chip development, during an interview with People's Daily. While acknowledging that Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. counterparts by a generation, Ren suggested that techniques like stacking and clustering could achieve comparable computing results. He emphasized China's advantages in AI development, citing a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network, along with open-source software. Ren's comments come as Washington increases restrictions on China, with Huawei at the center of the storm, including new guidance interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a potential violation of export controls.</p>

          <p>The Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel without engaging crowds unless necessary. These troops will carry weapons but without ammunition loaded, using it only for self-defense, and they will not employ rubber bullets or pepper spray unless President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The Los Angeles Police Department emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response, while retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds stressed the importance of clarifying the rules of engagement for the troops' sake. The deployed force, known as "Task Force 51," consists of 4,800 troops trained in de-escalation and crowd control.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, according to Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, in an effort to lower the high prices of the country's staple food. This move will leave Japan with a 100,000-ton rice reserve, with the released rice going to smaller supermarket operators as well as major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, prompting the government to resort to direct contracts with retailers to sell cheaper rice. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, with the 2020 rice expected to sell at 1,700 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves calling it a "landmark decision" to "kickstart" economic growth. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy," as the plant is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C criticized the government for not being transparent about the project's cost, fearing it will add to consumer bills. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though Sizewell C will take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, plans to split into two separate companies by mid-next year, separating its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This move comes as streaming services gain popularity while cable TV audiences decline, with HBO Max finding success through shows like Succession and The White Lotus. The new Streaming & Studios business will be headed by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, including CNN and Discovery, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The split follows the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros Discovery, aiming to empower each company with sharper focus and strategic flexibility.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to automate routine tasks and allow more focus on face-to-face time with students. The Department for Education advises transparency in AI use and emphasizes the need for teachers to check the results. The guidance suggests AI should be used for "low-stakes" marking, such as quizzes and homework, and provides examples of how AI can generate routine letters to parents. While the Association of School and College Leaders acknowledges the potential for freeing up time, concerns remain about data breaches and marking errors.</p>
