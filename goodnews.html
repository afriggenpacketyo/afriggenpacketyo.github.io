        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>White House "border czar" Tom Homan stated that the Trump administration does not intend to arrest California Governor Gavin Newsom, despite President Trump suggesting he was open to the idea amidst escalating tensions over protests and law enforcement responses in Los Angeles. Homan clarified that officials would only be arrested if they impede ICE and commit crimes against ICE officers, leaving the decision of prosecution to the Justice Department. Newsom had responded to the administration's criticism with defiance, while local officials expressed concerns that the troop deployments could aggravate the protests and argued that local law enforcement could handle the situation. Homan defended the necessity of sending National Guard forces into Los Angeles, citing property damage and assaults on ICE agents by protesters. Optimism around this article is based on the fact that the situation is being de-escalated by a member of the Trump administration. </p>

          <p>A planned trial run for displaying Japanese political advertisements on convenience stores' electronic signage screens has been canceled by an association promoting the digitalization of election campaigns. The trial, scheduled to start at FamilyMart Co. stores in Tokyo, aimed to encourage young people's interest in politics amidst low voter turnout. A company official stated the dates were not met due to careful consideration of participation, but the chain will continue studying ways to improve voter turnout using digital signage. The initiative was announced by an association for digital transformation of policy and public affairs, including lawmakers, advertising industry members, and legal experts. There is a slight amount of optimism based on the fact that the company is still researching ways to improve voter turnout.</p>

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind US chips by a generation, but advanced performance can be achieved through tactics like stacking and clustering. Ren's comments, in an interview with the Communist Party's mouthpiece, echo the view that US sanctions have failed to halt China's technological advancements, especially in AI. He highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network. The interview was published amidst increasing US restrictions on China and Huawei, with the US Department of Commerce potentially interpreting the use of Ascend chips as a violation of American export controls. The optimism score is based on the idea that China is still able to achieve advanced performance despite lagging behind.</p>

          <p>Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily protecting federal buildings and personnel without engaging crowds unless necessary, according to U.S. officials.

Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for open communication between agencies to prevent confusion and ensure a coordinated response. Retired Air Force Brig. Gen. Thomas Edmonds highlighted the importance of clarifying when deadly force can be used. The optimism score is based on the fact that the troops are tasked with de-escalating the situation.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers, according to farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move aims to curb the elevated prices of Japan's staple food, leaving the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. The released rice will target smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, prompting the government to expect that cheaper rice sold through direct contracts will lower overall prices. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the government's effort to stabilize rice prices. </p>

          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, which is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband sees it as necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." However, Alison Downes of Stop Sizewell C criticized the cost and potential impact on consumer bills. The investment aims to almost completely eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, but the project will take at least a decade to complete. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the investment in clean energy but also the concerns about cost and delays.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" with "fundamental flaws" that "entrench outdated gender stereotypes." The report calls for "bold" action, including increasing paternity pay and leave, though significant investment is required. Statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks. There is moderate optimism because it is highlighting areas for improvement, and a government review is underway.</p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use AI to speed up marking and write letters home to parents. Training materials say AI can "help automate routine tasks" and free up time for face-to-face teaching. Teachers must be transparent about their use of AI and always check its results, with the Department for Education saying AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking. Emma Darcy, a secondary school leader, said teachers have "almost a moral responsibility" to learn how to use AI because pupils are already doing so. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the potential benefits of AI in education but also the need for caution and oversight.</p>
