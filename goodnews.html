          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended due to pantograph problems detected the previous night. The suspension of both inner and outer loops of the JR Yamanote Line, which circles central Tokyo, caused significant disruption for commuters. Operations were halted to inspect equipment related to power supply to carriages. Services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also resumed with delays, while the Keiyo Line experienced temporary suspension due to smoke on the tracks at Hatchobori Station. The cause of the abnormality was traced to a power line-related facility near Shimbashi Station.</p>

          <p>The CDC's airport screening program has identified multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, linked to a surge in China, among international travelers at airports in California, Washington, Virginia, and the New York City area. The variant, a descendant of the XDV lineage, is dominant in China and rising in parts of Asia. While Hong Kong authorities see no evidence of increased severity, they urge masking in public transportation. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially increasing transmissibility. The FDA's vaccine advisors are considering updating COVID-19 vaccines to target JN.1 variants, which may offer better protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>

          <p>Judge Jeffrey White of the Northern District of California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's effort to detain and deport international students whose visas were revoked without clear justification. The temporary injunction protects students participating in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, preventing their arrest or visa revocation while the case proceeds. Judge White expressed suspicion that the Trump administration was trying to place future visa terminations beyond judicial review, criticizing the government's abrupt changes in course during litigation. The order comes hours after the Trump administration halted Harvard University‚Äôs ability to enroll international students, and this nationwide order could at least in part prevent the Trump administration‚Äôs move from being enforced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has sided with President Donald Trump in a dispute over his authority to remove appointees from federal boards. The court upheld Trump‚Äôs removal of two Democratic appointees, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) respectively. The ruling addresses whether board members appointed by President Joe Biden can remain in their positions while a larger legal battle continues over the president's power to fire agency officials. Justice Elena Kagan, along with Justices Sotomayor and Jackson, dissented, suggesting the ruling telegraphs a future decision that would grant the President significant control over the Executive Branch.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate climbed to 3.5% in April, the highest in over two years, driven partly by rising rice prices, as the Bank of Japan (BOJ) considers pausing rate hikes to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, exceeding the BOJ's 2% target for over three years. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates but also emphasized monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Economists anticipate core inflation will ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and yen appreciation. Oversupply of food from U.S. tariffs could also decrease food prices, while government subsidies for electricity and gas bills may further reduce inflation.</p>

The Prince of Wales said he hopes his series can present the wonders of the natural world, much like Attenborough's documentaries. The series will focus on the risks faced by rangers, with around 1,400 having died in the past decade, and aims to raise awareness of their crucial role.

The new program will involve two squads of 11 horses performing two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week.

Brink was confirmed as ambassador to Kyiv shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022 and served during the early months of the Trump administration.

This success led to her writing "The Bagel Baker of Mulliner Lane" and designing toys like Sweetie Pops and Baby Check-Up.
