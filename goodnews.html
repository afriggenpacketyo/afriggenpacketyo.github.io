          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:19:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to allow a US ban on TikTok was the critical factor that compelled the app's parent company, ByteDance, to negotiate a deal. Bessent stated that the administration prioritized national security over the deal itself, which ultimately broke the stalemate in negotiations with China. While a framework is in place, the deal, which could involve tech company Oracle, is still pending finalization as a September 17th deadline approaches. The potential agreement is seen as a possible turning point in the strained trade relations between the two global economic powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill designed to prevent cover-ups following major disasters by legally requiring public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations. The legislation, championed for years by families of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster victims, will impose a "duty of candour" and criminal sanctions for non-compliance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law will change the balance of power, ensuring the state cannot hide from the people it serves and will benefit victims of other scandals like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon affair.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 08:15:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend known as "job hugging" is emerging in the labor market, with employees choosing to remain in their current roles due to economic uncertainty and a cooling job market. The national quits rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, reflecting a slowdown in hiring and a decreased willingness among workers to seek new opportunities. Career experts advise that while staying put can provide security, it also carries the risk of complacency. They recommend that employees who are "hugging" their jobs should actively seek internal growth, build new skills, and expand their professional networks to remain valuable and prepared for future opportunities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luckin Coffee, the chain that surpassed Starbucks in China, is now expanding into the United States with a tech-forward, aggressive discounting strategy. Operating cashierless stores where all orders are placed via a mobile app, Luckin attracts customers with frequent coupons offering significant price reductions. This model contrasts sharply with Starbucks' focus on per-store profitability, as analysts suggest Luckin's initial US locations are operating at a loss to build brand awareness. The company's expansion comes after a tumultuous history, including a 2020 accounting fraud scandal that led to its delisting from the Nasdaq, from which it has since re-emerged with new leadership.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:54:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources familiar with negotiations indicate that technology giant Oracle is part of a consortium of companies involved in a framework deal that would allow TikTok to continue its US operations. While the final structure remains unclear, the deal is being finalized ahead of an expected discussion between President Trump and Chinese President Xi. Oracle, whose co-founder Larry Ellison is a friend of Trump, has been a long-rumored suitor and already partners with TikTok to manage US user data.

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has released positive late-stage trial data for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide. The results showed that patients taking the once-weekly injection achieved an average weight loss of 11.8% over 68 weeks, significantly more than the placebo group. Cagrilinitide works differently from existing GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, mimicking a different hormone to increase feelings of fullness. The company highlighted the drug's favorable tolerability profile, with mostly mild side effects, as it seeks a next-generation blockbuster to address supply constraints and competition in the lucrative weight-loss market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered what are believed to be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, across various sites in Southeast Asia. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analyzed human remains buried in crouched positions and found evidence of smoke-drying over a fire. This mummification practice, predating the well-known Egyptian and Chinchorro mummies by thousands of years, was likely performed by hunter-gatherer communities to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their ancestors. The findings suggest this funerary tradition may have been widespread across the region for millennia.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the legendary 1975 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, this article revisits the "Thrilla in Manila" as a pinnacle of the sport and a mirror of its time. The brutal, 14-round bout was the culmination of a bitter rivalry that reflected broader societal tensions, staged against the backdrop of Ferdinand Marcos's autocratic rule in the Philippines. The fight explored the limits of human endurance, with Ali's taunts pushing the rivalry into personal animosity. The event, broadcast globally via satellite, showcased both the beauty and the ugliness of boxing, leaving both fighters physically and emotionally scarred but cementing their legacies in history.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a setback to the administration's efforts to influence the central bank. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in the upcoming policy meeting where an interest rate cut is anticipated. Trump had moved to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, but the case raises critical questions about the Fed's independence from political interference. The ruling upholds the legal provision that Fed governors can only be removed "for cause," a standard never before tested in court.</p>

          <p>New figures from the Department for Work and Pensions reveal that the number of recipients of the UK's winter fuel payment dropped from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year. The dramatic decrease was the result of a controversial government decision to means-test the payment, restricting it to pensioners on low-income benefits. Following a significant political backlash, the chancellor reversed the policy in June. For the upcoming winter, the payment will once again be available to the vast majority of pensioners, with an estimated nine million households set to receive the assistance for their energy bills.</p>

          <p>Researchers have scientifically confirmed the source of a vibrant blue color in Jackson Pollock's famous 1948 painting, "Number 1A, 1948." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, they created a chemical fingerprint identifying the pigment as manganese blue, a synthetic color that was phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This is the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment in his work. The study provides new insight into the materials used by the abstract expressionist artist and demonstrates how scientific techniques can be used to conserve and understand historical artworks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest wage growth figures from the Office for National Statistics. Under the "triple lock" policy, the pension rises by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5%. This increase would raise the new state pension by over £500 a year, pushing the annual total closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. Experts warn that this trend will result in an increasing number of pensioners being required to pay income tax on their state pension for the first time starting in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>
