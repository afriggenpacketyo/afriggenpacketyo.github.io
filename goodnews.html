          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" to resolve the conflict. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The administration had previously targeted Harvard for allegedly failing to address campus antisemitism, but the judge sided with the university.
