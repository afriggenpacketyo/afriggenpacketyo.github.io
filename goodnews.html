          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to lower U.S. drug prices by tying them to lower prices in other developed countries. The policy, dubbed the "most favored nation" policy, directs agencies to crack down on foreign policies that suppress drug prices and allows U.S. patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the lowest available prices. The order also sets targets for price reductions across all U.S. markets, potentially leading to negotiations between HHS and the pharmaceutical industry. The policy aims to address the issue of high drug costs in the U.S., which are significantly higher than in other developed nations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's statistical victories only serve to mask some very obvious flaws, highlighting a lack of ruthlessness and an inability to weather adversity. While Arsenal often wins the statistical metrics, they struggle to translate these advantages into actual victories. Manager Mikel Arteta's focus on maximizing the likelihood of winning through statistics has not consistently led to desired outcomes, as the team struggles to maintain leads and exhibits a lack of discipline, evidenced by their league-leading number of red cards. The article suggests that Arsenal needs to find a better balance between statistical analysis and the intangible qualities that define successful teams.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. Apple stock experienced a positive boost following the announcement. Trump indicated that Cook is planning to increase Apple's investment in the United States, potentially building more plants. Any easing of U.S.-China trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, given its significant production and sales presence in China.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to the Middle East is largely focused on securing business deals rather than advancing a strategic vision for the region. The trip includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, where Trump aims to announce deals worth over $1 trillion. This approach aligns with the Trump family's expanding business interests in the region, including deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms and projects backed by the governments of Qatar and the UAE. While previous administrations have linked economic negotiations to diplomatic objectives, Trump's focus appears to be primarily on financial transactions.</p>

          <p>As the popularity of GLP-1 medications soars, restaurant etiquette is evolving, with diners and restaurants adjusting to new norms. People taking these drugs often eat smaller portions, leading to new dining dynamics. Individuals on GLP-1s are navigating how to order, share, and leave food without causing offense, while those dining with them are adjusting to altered eating habits. Some restaurants are adapting by offering smaller plates and family-style options, while others are finding that these dynamics improve the dining experience overall.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is urging cities and towns to ban homeless encampments on public property, offering a model ordinance for local governments to adopt. The ordinance would make it illegal to construct semi-permanent structures or camp on public property for more than three consecutive days. It also requires cities to offer shelter and provide 48 hours' notice before clearing encampments. The move coincides with the release of $3.3 billion in state housing funds to expand local housing and treatment options.</p>
