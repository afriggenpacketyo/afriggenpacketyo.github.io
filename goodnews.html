          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service for fresh foods, including meat, eggs, and produce, to over 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The company plans to reach at least 2,300 locations by year-end, following successful tests that showed increased engagement from first-time grocery customers. This service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, with a small fee for smaller orders or non-members. The announcement led to stock drops for competitors like Instacart, Kroger, and Albertsons, intensifying the competition in the grocery delivery market. Amazon continues to retool its grocery business, integrating Whole Foods more closely and emphasizing household staples.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. famine early warning system, FEWS NET, is being restored after a multi-month suspension initiated by the Trump administration in January. Established in 1985 following the Ethiopian famine, this crucial system integrates diverse data, from weather to trade, to predict hunger hotspots up to eight months in advance. Its unexpected shutdown created a significant gap in critical information for global aid organizations and governments, raising concerns about planning for food crises. The revival is welcomed by humanitarian aid experts, who underscore FEWS NET's vital role in preventing human suffering, mass migration, and ensuring stability, emphasizing its cost-effectiveness over reactive disaster relief efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that U.S. adult alcohol consumption has reached a record low, with only 54% reporting drinking, a significant drop from 62% in 2023. This decline is largely attributed to a growing public perception that even moderate drinking is harmful, with a majority (53%) now holding this view, up from 45% last year. Fewer Americans are drinking regularly, and the average weekly intake has fallen to its lowest since 1996. This trend is not linked to a shift towards recreational cannabis. The article highlights how increasing health warnings from public health authorities, alongside economic factors like inflation, are reshaping drinking habits and impacting alcohol sales across the nation.</p>

Schenk, the only German in the NSL, praises its robust professional structures, including provisions for extended maternity leave and player consent for transfers, which are often lacking in smaller European leagues. She describes the NSL as a blend of European and North American styles, offering players the opportunity to fully concentrate on their performance.

          <h2>FDA Launches 'PreCheck' Program to Boost U.S. Drug Manufacturing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 10:21:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has launched a new "PreCheck" program aimed at streamlining the creation of new drug manufacturing sites in the U.S., directly responding to President Trump's executive order to reduce regulatory hurdles. The initiative seeks to reverse the nation's significant reliance on foreign drug production, which currently accounts for over half of U.S.-distributed pharmaceuticals and poses national security risks. The two-phase program will allow drugmakers more frequent engagement with the FDA during critical development stages, such as facility design, and provide early feedback to expedite application assessments. This move supports domestic production but comes amid industry concerns about potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals impacting innovation and patient access.</p>

          <h2>UK Average Two-Year Mortgage Rates Dip Below 5% for First Time Since Truss Budget</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 10:05:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average two-year fixed mortgage rate in the UK has fallen below 5% to 4.99%, marking a "symbolic turning point" for homebuyers. This is the first time rates have been this low since the market turmoil following Liz Truss's mini-budget in September 2022, which caused borrowing costs to soar. While the Bank of England has cut interest rates multiple times, future reductions remain uncertain, with inflation forecasts suggesting the base rate may hold steady. The competitive mortgage market sees lenders offering ultra-competitive rates, with some as low as 3.7%. This easing of rates, combined with rising wages, is gradually improving affordability and contributing to resilience in the housing market, with modest house price gains expected.

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy admitted to an "administrative error" for not possessing a rod fishing license during a diplomatic fishing trip with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House. Despite not catching any fish, the oversight violated Environment Agency regulations, which require licenses for freshwater fishing in England and Wales. Lammy has since purchased the necessary license and informed the Environment Agency, demonstrating his rectification of the error. The agency can issue fines up to £2,500 for illegal fishing. The incident highlights the meticulous nature of regulations, even during informal diplomatic engagements, and the importance of compliance for all, regardless of their public standing.</p>

          <h2>Gianluigi Donnarumma's PSG Future Uncertain Amidst Manchester City Transfer Speculation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gianluigi Donnarumma's future at Paris Saint-Germain is uncertain after being excluded from a recent final, following PSG's acquisition of another goalkeeper. While Manchester City sources describe links to Donnarumma as speculation, they haven't ruled out a move if their current number one, Ederson, departs, as Ederson is entering the final year of his contract. PSG's coach is seeking a "different profile" of goalkeeper, despite Donnarumma's agent claiming the player offered a salary reduction to stay. This situation highlights the complexities of top-tier football transfers and the strategic decisions clubs make regarding player profiles and team composition. Donnarumma's performance metrics suggest he could fit City's system, especially his passing accuracy.</p>
