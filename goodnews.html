          <p>Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, has unveiled its first electric SUV, the YU7, targeting Tesla's Model Y in the Chinese market. Xiaomi claims the YU7 will have a driving range of at least 760 kilometers (472 miles) on a single charge, surpassing the 719 km range advertised for Tesla's extended-range Model Y. Citi analysts predict the YU7 will be priced competitively, between 250,000 yuan to 320,000 yuan ($34,700 to $44,420), and expects monthly sales of around 30,000 units, potentially eroding Tesla's market share. Xiaomi plans to officially launch the YU7 and announce its price in July.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move comes as the government seeks to address public criticism regarding its handling of escalating rice prices amid broader inflation concerns. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system that farming cooperatives primarily used. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency of the situation and established a special response team to tackle high rice price issues and prevent consumer abandonment of rice products.</p>

His film challenged the myth of widespread French resistance to the Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens of Clermont-Ferrand who either collaborated with the Nazis or turned a blind eye to the persecution of Jews and anti-Nazis. The film, initially banned from French television, sparked controversy and critical acclaim for its dispassionate and incisive examination of wartime France.

          <p>Businesses are minimizing the impact of tariffs by utilizing a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, potentially reducing duty costs by stripping out the middleman's profit. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes. To apply the rule, businesses must have at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, sales must be at arm's length, there must be proof the item was destined for the U.S., and documentation of the first sale price is required.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has found that sleep facilitates the brain's repair mode by clearing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals accumulated during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) acts as a molecular signal, triggering sleep and restoring balance in the brain. Confirming a decades-old hypothesis, the team discovered that when H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," prompting restorative slumber. Excess build-up of free radicals can disrupt sleep quality and cause inflammation, providing critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases like Alzheimer‚Äôs.</p>

Faust draws parallels between the divisiveness of the Civil War era and the current national crisis, urging Americans to uphold the legacy of those who fought to preserve democracy.

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that United States Steel Corp. will remain under American control even after a "planned partnership" with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp., despite Nippon Steel's intention to acquire it. Trump said that the deal will be controlled by the United States, or else he would not approve it. He also mentioned that the partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and provide a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. Trump's approval came after a panel of federal agencies screened Nippon Steel's plan.</p>
