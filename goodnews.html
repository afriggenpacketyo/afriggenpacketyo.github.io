          <h2>Japanese Public Divided on Timing of Farm Minister's Dismissal</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 03:14:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that 42.2% of respondents believe the farm minister's dismissal over a rice-related blunder occurred too late. This reflects public sentiment regarding the government's handling of the situation and the minister's performance. The sacking highlights the importance of public perception and accountability in Japanese politics, especially concerning essential sectors like agriculture. The poll results suggest that a significant portion of the population felt the response was not timely, potentially affecting public trust in the cabinet.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates a marginal rise in the support rate for the Ishiba Cabinet, reaching 31.7%.

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., issued an apology for inaccurately describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study material. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, prompting criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. The company has since removed the inaccurate video and corrected the information on its website. The incident highlights the importance of accurate and responsible educational content, particularly concerning sensitive health-related topics.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways (SWR) has become the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership, marking the beginning of the Labour government's rail renationalization scheme. The government plans to bring all rail services under public control by the end of 2027, aiming to end 30 years of fragmentation and improve service for passengers. While rail unions have welcomed the move, the government acknowledges that change will take time. The renationalization is expected to save millions in compensation fees paid to rail operators.</p>
