          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are strategizing to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent spoiler candidate. Conversely, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue that Mamdani's large victory margin demonstrates his mainstream appeal. Mamdani is actively engaging with all factions, including concerned CEOs, while prominent national Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have shown openness to his candidacy, reflecting the complex and evolving political landscape in the city.</p>

The 23-year-old Chelsea star is available for England's final Euro 2025 warm-up match against Jamaica, though she is expected to play limited minutes as a substitute. Manager Sarina Wiegman noted that James has been performing well in training and is ready to be gradually reintroduced to game time ahead of the tournament.

          <p>Across the world, communities have been celebrating Pride Month throughout June with vibrant parades, festivals, and demonstrations. These events commemorate the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ rights and inclusion, tracing their origins back to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City. That historic clash between police and patrons of the Stonewall Inn is now widely considered the catalyst for the modern LGBTQ rights movement. From Kathmandu to Washington D.C., participants have gathered to honor this legacy. The month of events symbolizes both a celebration of identity and a continued protest for equal rights and recognition for the community.</p>

          <p>In the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, Trader Joe's has opened a new grocery store, creating the unusual situation of having two of its locations operating directly across the street from one another. The original plan was to close the older, smaller store, which has been a neighborhood staple since 1973. However, due to tremendous business in the area, the company decided to keep both open. The new store is 40% larger and features more aisles and a spacious underground parking garage, a major improvement over the notoriously cramped lot of its predecessor, attracting both new and loyal customers.</p>

          <h2>European Union Proposes Global Restrictions on Eel Trade Despite Japanese Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has formally proposed new international trade restrictions on all eel species, a move that faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer. The proposal, submitted under the Washington Convention treaty, would require any country exporting eels to provide proof of legal capture and an official permit. If adopted, the regulations would take effect in June 2027 and would impact the trade of Japanese eel and other species. The measure aims to protect endangered eel populations by increasing oversight and control over the global market, but it creates a point of contention with nations reliant on the trade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political rebuke, voters in Huntington Beach, California, decisively passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system from a conservative-led city council. The measures successfully blocked the creation of a parental review board that would have controlled children's book selections and prevented the privatization of the library system. This outcome is seen as a grassroots victory against the council's MAGA-aligned agenda, which had sought to censor books on LGBTQ+ issues and puberty. The successful campaign united residents across the political spectrum who felt the council had overstepped, offering a lesson in civic pushback.</p>

The event transformed the serpentine structure into a unique acoustic space, with sounds from different ensembles blending as guests walked the route.

Johnson, who recently gave birth to her fourth child, thanked the NHS for their care during what she described as a "brutal" week.

Their departure follows the expiration of a lease agreement, and the two remaining pandas at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo are scheduled to return by next February.
