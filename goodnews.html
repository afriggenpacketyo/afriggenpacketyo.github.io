          <p>Australians are heading to the polls to elect a new government amidst a challenging economic and political landscape. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, while the country navigates its relationship with the United States and China. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, of the Labor Party, is seeking a second term, while opposition leader Peter Dutton, of the conservative coalition, is challenging for leadership. Recent polls indicate a close race, with both parties offering small-scale measures to address economic pressures. The article also touches upon cultural issues and a shift away from major parties, with independent candidates and minor parties gaining traction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in English local elections, positioning itself as a major challenger to Britain's traditional political parties. The party won 677 seats, seizing control of eight authorities from the Conservatives and displacing Labour in several areas. Farage celebrated the results, claiming Reform had surpassed the Tories as the main opposition to the Labour government. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, acknowledged the party's struggles and the presence of "protest in the air." The results indicate a continuing fragmentation of the British political landscape, with both Labour and the Conservatives experiencing a decline in their combined share of the vote.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools after a dispute over transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funding for a child nutrition program after Maine refused to comply with demands to bar transgender girls from participating in girls' sports. Maine Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration's actions, leading to a settlement in which the USDA agreed to restore the funds. The governor expressed satisfaction with the victory, emphasizing the state's commitment to defending states' rights and opposing bullying tactics.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's efforts could lead to a universal antivenom that could save thousands of lives each year. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins common to deadly elapid snakes. The resulting antivenom cocktail has shown remarkable protection in experiments on mice.</p>

Additionally, Trump announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II."

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ordered the State Bar of California to revert to the traditional test format and lower the passing score on the February exam after a botched administration. The court cited concerns over the processes used to draft the questions, including the use of artificial intelligence. The State Bar's executive director, Leah T. Wilson, will step down in July after facing growing pressure to resign. The move comes after widespread criticism of the February exam, which was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities. The decision aims to restore confidence in the fairness and validity of the bar exam.</p>

          <p>Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy has begun wearing glasses in games to address astigmatism in his right eye, hoping to improve his vision and hitting performance. Muncy, whose vision is 20/12, learned he is slightly left-eye dominant, prompting him to try glasses to aid his right eye's focus. The decision follows in the footsteps of former Dodger Kik√© Hern√°ndez, who also began wearing glasses midseason and experienced improved performance. Muncy is hopeful that the glasses will help him see the ball better and improve his overall hitting.</p>
