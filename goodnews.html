          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:09:26 EDT</div>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent front-bench role. The move is described by a party source as part of the next phase of policy renewal and an effort to underline party unity. This shake-up is larger than initially anticipated and is seen as an attempt to strengthen the opposition's challenge to the current Labour government. The Labour Party has dismissed the changes as shuffling "the same old faces that were responsible for 14 years of failure."</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero for saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Olympic National Park, Washington. The child was walking with family on a popular trail when the cougar, which was fitted with a tracking collar, bit them. The child was airlifted to a trauma center and has since been released in satisfactory condition. Park rangers located and killed the animal following the incident. Witnesses at the scene praised the father's quick actions, stating that he jumped in to get the child away from the cougar, likely saving their life.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has pledged to invest $50 billion in its U.S. operations by 2030, a move that follows threats of new trade tariffs from the Trump administration. The investment includes a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia to produce its weight management drugs, which will be its largest single manufacturing investment globally. This funding aims to expand R&D, create thousands of jobs, and bolster the company's goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue, with half expected from the U.S. market. The announcement aligns with a trend of pharmaceutical firms increasing stateside investment amid pressure to reshore manufacturing.</p>

          <p>The UK government has become the majority shareholder in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, taking a 44.9% stake in the project, which is now estimated to cost £38 billion. This figure is nearly double the previous official estimate of £20 billion. The project, funded alongside companies like EDF and Centrica, is expected to generate power for six million homes and create thousands of jobs. While the government hails it as a step towards energy security, critics like the group Stop Sizewell C condemn the spiraling costs, warning that taxpayers will bear the risk of overruns.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian town of Ulefoss is located above Europe's largest known deposit of rare earth elements, critical materials for modern technology currently dominated by China. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to extract these resources through an "invisible mine," using a diagonal tunnel to minimize impact on the village above. While the project promises economic revival and could be a game-changer for European resource security, it also raises concerns among residents about potential environmental damage and geological instability. The company is working to address these concerns to avoid the issues seen in other mining towns.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, released by the Alibaba-backed Chinese startup Moonshot AI, has seen a rapid surge in popularity. The large language model (LLM) utilizes a cost-efficient "mixture-of-experts" (MOE) architecture, which divides tasks among specialized sub-networks, reducing computational costs for training and inference. Experts have praised this approach as a potential turning point in AI development strategy, contrasting with the massive resource expenditure of competitors like OpenAI. Kimi K2, which is currently free to use, demonstrates a more accessible path to developing powerful AI systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes how Italy, considered a dark horse, could challenge defending champions England in the Euro 2025 semi-final. Under coach Andrea Soncin, Italy has shown tactical flexibility, reaching their first semi-final in 28 years. The team's success is built around captain Cristiana Girelli and their ability to exploit opponents' weaknesses, particularly in wide areas, which could be a problem for England. While England are favorites, Italy's cohesive squad, largely drawn from top clubs Juventus and Roma, has the potential to punish any carelessness from the Lionesses in what is expected to be a fascinating tactical match.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, has announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year. In an interview, Soon-Shiong stated the move would "democratize" the paper, allowing the public to have ownership and ensure it represents the "voices of the people." He did not provide specific details on the structure of the public offering. This plan comes as The Times, like many news organizations, has faced significant financial challenges in recent years, even after Soon-Shiong purchased it in 2018 to return it to local control.</p>

The announcement triggered a surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies. This mega-project highlights China's focus on large-scale infrastructure but is also likely to raise geopolitical and environmental concerns with its downstream neighbors, India and Bangladesh.

          <p>The race to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota targeting mass production before 2030. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are initially focusing on semi-solid-state "bridge" technologies, the ultimate goal is a full solid-state cell. However, some experts express skepticism, pointing to persistent technological hurdles, high costs, and significant recent improvements in conventional LFP batteries which are narrowing the performance gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, writer Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations faced by authors from the Balkans in the Western literary market. She argues that U.S. and UK publishers often prioritize stories that explain the region's political context or focus on historical trauma, effectively requiring Balkan writers to self-exoticize. This unspoken condition, she contends, presumes the region is primarily a source of tragedy and overlooks a diverse range of universal human stories that don't fit a "problematic" or "traumatic" narrative. Schnabl calls for publishers to embrace the region's full literary diversity beyond reinforcing established perceptions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which affected 30,000 people in the 1970s-90s.

Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed through a deceased family member's estate, with further consultations on other issues. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the announcement, they expressed disappointment that some issues, like compensation levels for hepatitis victims, still require further review.</p>
