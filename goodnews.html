          <p>Chime, a financial technology company that identifies as a technology company and not a bank, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "CHYM". The company generates revenue from interchange fees on debit and credit card purchases made by its 8.6 million active members, two-thirds of whom consider Chime their primary financial institution. In the March quarter, Chime reported a net income of $12.4 million on revenue of $518.7 million, representing a 32% revenue growth. However, Chime's IPO plans faced delays due to market volatility following President Trump's tariff announcements, joining other companies like eToro and Klarna in postponing their debuts.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market surpassing pre-tariff levels and a slower pace of inflation reported in April, investors remain wary due to uncertainty surrounding tariffs. The S&P 500 has recovered since the start of the year, but concerns persist about the impact of tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is adopting a wait-and-see approach before lowering interest rates, awaiting further data on tariff-induced inflation.

This news coincides with excerpts from a new book claiming Biden's health was so poor that aides considered the possibility of him needing a wheelchair if reelected. Biden and former First Lady Dr. Jill Biden have pushed back against claims of cognitive decline, asserting that those making such claims were not present to witness his daily work ethic. In February 2023, Biden had a cancerous lesion removed from his chest, but no further treatment was required.</p>

          <p>The FDA is considering removing ingestible fluoride prescription drug products for children from the market due to mounting evidence of potential health risks. These unapproved products, prescribed to infants and toddlers, have been linked to harm to the gut microbiome, potential thyroid dysfunction, weight gain, and reduced IQ. HHS Secretary Robert F.

          <p>Santa Monica officials are urging the public to refrain from feeding ground squirrels in Palisades Park, as the population is rapidly growing and causing ecological imbalances. The squirrels carry parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to people, and their burrowing contributes to coastal erosion. The city has previously attempted population control methods, such as poison, gassing, and euthanasia, but the squirrel population continues to grow. Other communities, including Chino Hills and San Pedro, are also struggling with ground squirrel overpopulation due to a lack of predators and excessive feeding.</p>

          <p>President Trump, on a state visit to Saudi Arabia, claimed to have secured $600 billion in deals, but the details provided were vague and totaled less than half that number. The biggest deal was a $142 billion defense sales agreement, while other projects were already in the works before Trump took office. Trump also announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria and encouraged Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords. He spoke at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, where business leaders discussed increasing investment in the United States and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick addressed his relationship with Jordon Hudson, insisting it is a personal matter and unrelated to football. This comes after reports that Hudson was barred from UNC's football operations, which the school has denied. Belichick said he has spoken to his players about the situation and emphasized his focus on helping them develop professionally on and off the field. The coach is known for his ruthlessly focused approach and aims to bring a similar philosophy to UNC.</p>
