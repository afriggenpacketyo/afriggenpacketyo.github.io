          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris attended the 2025 Met Gala, marking her first public appearance since her 2024 presidential defeat, where she emphasized the intertwining of art and politics. Harris, wearing an Off-White gown designed by IB Kamara, highlighted art's power to capture the mood and language of people, influencing culture, policies, and politics. She recently delivered a major speech in San Francisco, criticizing President Trump's economic agenda and suggesting she is considering a political comeback, potentially as California's governor in 2026 or a presidential candidate in 2028. Sources indicate she is weighing a gubernatorial bid, a third presidential run, or not seeking elected office.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested steep tariffs on movies produced overseas. Newsom aims to partner with the Trump administration to strengthen domestic production, building on California's existing state program. This proposal comes in response to Trump's call for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the United States, which caused confusion and concern in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal, aiming to re-shore American jobs in the industry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. Judge Jamal Whitehead rejected the administration's interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling, which had narrowed an earlier decision from Whitehead. The appeals court had stated that the government should continue processing those who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The judge criticized the government's attempt to rewrite the judicial order and emphasized the administration's obligation to follow statutory and constitutional law.</p>

          <p>Car manufacturer Ford and toy company Mattel have issued warnings regarding the increasing costs associated with President Trump's tariffs. Mattel indicated that it would be raising prices on some of its toys sold in the US and decreasing its production in China for the American market.

These announcements join a growing list of major businesses expressing concern about the impact of US tariffs on their operations and the broader economy.

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is progressing toward becoming an official city. A vote to formally organize Starbase as a city was approved by local voters, primarily SpaceX employees. This move has drawn both support and criticism, with concerns raised about Musk's potential control over the area and the authority to close a nearby beach and state park for launches. SpaceX aims to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 annually, and the creation of a company town has prompted debates about balancing economic development with public access and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contested State Supreme Court race, rejecting efforts to throw out thousands of votes. The ruling favored Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, confirming her victory by 734 votes over Republican challenger Judge Jefferson Griffin. The judge determined that failing to count the challenged ballots would violate the constitutional due process rights of the voters. Griffin has been given seven days to appeal the ruling, which could potentially end a nearly six-month-long election dispute.</p>
