          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has announced that he will begin interviewing a field of eleven candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair shortly after Labor Day. This process is being expedited by the White House, which is advocating for interest rate cuts to stimulate the U.S. housing market. Bessent suggested that a significant rate reduction could foster a boom in home building, thereby helping to control inflation in the long term. The current chair, Jerome Powell, is scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the Jackson Hole symposium, which may offer insights into the Fed's future policy direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has described President Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine as a significant breakthrough following a summit at the White House. Starmer, who has long advocated for 'gratitude diplomacy' with Trump, expressed satisfaction with the progress toward a potential meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin. While European officials were initially apprehensive about the summit's risks, Starmer reported a strong sense of unity among the leaders. The focus has now shifted to strengthening Ukraine's position for any future peace negotiations, bolstered by the U.S. pledge of involvement in security assurances.</p>

          <p>Home Depot reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking the first time it has missed on both metrics since 2014. Despite this, the company maintained its full-year guidance, anticipating 2.8% total sales growth, citing building momentum and a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions. Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail noted that homeowners continue to display a "deferral mindset" regarding major projects, which has impacted results. The retailer's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could spur more significant home improvement activity later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The thong swimsuit, now a popular fashion item, was created by Austrian-born designer Rudi Gernreich in 1974 as a political statement against a ban on nude bathing in Los Angeles. Gernreich, a gay man and early LGBTQ+ rights activist, viewed the design as a tool for bodily liberation rather than sexualization, aiming to challenge societal hang-ups. His work consistently pushed boundaries, including the creation of the topless "monokini" in 1964 and pioneering unisex fashion. The article reflects on his legacy as a proponent of body positivity and notes how his rebellion against prudery remains relevant in today's cultural landscape.</p>

          <p>According to US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the UK government has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "backdoor" for accessing encrypted data of American citizens. The claim follows a prolonged dispute where the UK's Home Office issued a "technical capability notice" under the Investigatory Powers Act, prompting a legal challenge from Apple and criticism from US officials. In response to the UK's initial demand, Apple had suspended advanced data protection options for new British customers. This reversal is presented as a victory for digital privacy and civil liberties, though official comments from the UK Home Office and Apple are pending.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Washington, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed satisfaction with the progress made toward peace in Ukraine, though differences in approach between the U.S. and Europe have emerged. While President Trump favors moving directly to a peace agreement, European leaders, including Merz, insist on a ceasefire as a necessary first step. A key topic of discussion was the nature of future security guarantees for Ukraine, with options ranging from NATO-style mutual defense assurances to the deployment of international peacekeeping troops. The possibility of German ground troops participating in such a mission remains an open and debated question within Germany's government.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to gradually resume operations after its 10,000 striking flight attendants reached a tentative agreement with the airline, ending a walkout that began over the weekend. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced the deal, which reportedly resolves a key issue by guaranteeing pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. The strike had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The airline's CEO stated that a full restoration of the flight schedule may take seven to ten days as the complex process of restarting operations begins.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in matcha's popularity marks its second wave as a major trend, moving from a niche health drink in the mid-2010s to a mainstream staple. This new boom is largely attributed to social media, where the tea's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation are highly photogenic and shareable. Unlike its first wave, the current craze is less about the traditional, sometimes bitter taste of matcha itself and more about its versatility in highly sweetened and customized lattes. This adaptability allows a broader audience to participate in the trend, turning the drink into a symbol of a shared cultural experience in an algorithmically isolated world.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee's new film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a contemporary remake of Akira Kurosawa's classic "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a wealthy music producer in a luxury Brooklyn high-rise. The plot centers on a moral dilemma when his chauffeur's son is mistakenly kidnapped instead of his own, forcing him to confront a world outside his elite bubble. The article suggests the film serves as a self-aware satire, with Lee examining his own evolution from an independent artist to an established figure. While the film's beginning is noted as choppy, its latter half is praised for its classic New York energy and sharp social commentary.</p>

          <p>A growing number of single men are choosing to become fathers on their own through surrogacy or adoption, a demographic that was virtually nonexistent two decades ago. This trend is driven by rising singlehood rates, a loosening of traditional kinship norms, and a reprioritization of life goals, particularly since the pandemic. For many, fatherhood offers a profound sense of purpose and connection in an era where traditional markers of manhood are evolving. While the process is often logistically complex and financially prohibitive, these men are actively creating the families they desire, challenging conventional expectations of what it means to be a father.</p>

This major acquisition will test the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) current media ownership rules under the Trump administration, which limit a single company's reach to 39% of the country. Broadcasters have been advocating for these rules to be relaxed to better compete with large tech companies. The combined entity would own 265 stations reaching approximately 80% of the U.S., a move that reflects the industry's push for consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite their widespread use, the dietary supplement industry in the United States operates under loose regulation, allowing companies to make vague health claims without undergoing rigorous clinical trials. According to health columnist Anahad O’Conner, the FDA has limited power to intervene unless a product causes severe side effects, creating a "Wild West" environment for consumers. While some supplements like creatine may offer modest benefits when combined with exercise, many others, such as collagen, lack convincing scientific support. Experts advise that most people can obtain necessary nutrients from a healthy diet and should be cautious about the claims and potential risks of supplements.</p>

This dominance is reflected in its global broadcast deals, valued at $5.1 billion annually.

          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in top European soccer clubs, attracted by soaring revenues and valuations. In the 2023-24 season, Europe's five largest leagues generated over 20 billion euros in revenue, a massive increase from 2.5 billion euros in the mid-1990s. This financial growth has led to American investors now holding full or partial ownership in a majority of England's Premier League teams. The trend is also driven by the relative affordability of European clubs compared to top-tier U.S. sports franchises, with private equity firms often using a multi-club ownership model to maximize their investments.
