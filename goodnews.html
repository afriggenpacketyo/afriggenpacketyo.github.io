          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would remove all sanctions against Syria, aiming to foster stability and peace in the war-torn nation. Speaking at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Riyadh, Trump highlighted his administration's initial steps toward normalizing relations with Syria after over a decade of estrangement. Syria, designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, has faced additional sanctions since 2004 and 2011. The toppling of the Assad regime in 2024 offered a chance for a new beginning under President Ahmed al-Sharaa, though the country still faces myriad international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Pandora, the Danish jewelry giant, is preparing to address potential financial fallout from President Trump's tariffs on goods from Thailand and Vietnam. CEO Alexander Lacik outlined strategies including price increases and rerouting shipments to mitigate the impact, estimating potential costs of up to $135 million annually if tariffs remain high. The company is also streamlining its supply chain, such as altering distribution routes for Canada and Latin America, but moving production to the United States is not being considered due to higher labor costs. Despite the uncertainty, Lacik expressed confidence in Pandora's resilience, citing past successes in navigating economic challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the reinstatement of Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, who were previously banned due to gambling scandals. This decision makes them eligible for the Hall of Fame, with the earliest possible induction in 2028. Rose, banned in 1989 for betting on baseball, had his ban lifted posthumously, while Jackson, implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal, also gains eligibility. Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark stated that players affected by Manfred's ruling would be considered, though voters are also told to consider a player's "integrity, sportsmanship, character and contribution to the game."</p>

          <p>Senior Indian officials dismissed President Trump's assertion that his administration single-handedly brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. The officials indicated that India had briefed key partners, including Quad members, about its military actions against "terror bases" in Pakistan. They added that India's top diplomat maintained regular contact with the Trump administration, but only to brief them on India's actions rather than engage in mediation. Beijing has long opposed the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, viewing it as an attempt to counter its influence.</p>

The order directs the Department of Health to negotiate new drug prices, potentially linking them to lower prices paid by other countries.
