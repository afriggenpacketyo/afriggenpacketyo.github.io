          <h2>European Parenthood Study Reveals Complex Relationship Between Satisfaction and Meaning</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent European study involving over 43,000 respondents across 30 countries reveals a nuanced perspective on parenthood. While parents report a deeper sense of meaning in their lives compared to childfree individuals, they also experience lower life satisfaction, particularly among mothers. The study emphasizes that the impact of parenthood on life satisfaction is heavily influenced by factors such as living situations and family policies within their respective countries. Scandinavian countries, with their robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies, demonstrate smaller disparities in life satisfaction between parents and non-parents, suggesting that societal support significantly alleviates the challenges of raising children. This data highlights the importance of community and governmental involvement in supporting families to enhance overall well-being and gender equality.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to its Penal Code, shifting the focus from punishment to rehabilitation within the prison system. This marks the first significant change to Japan's century-old crime laws, emphasizing efforts to reduce recidivism through rehabilitative guidance and education. Imprisonment is no longer categorized by the requirement of labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory, which allows more time for inmates to participate in programs tailored to their individual needs. This reform reflects a modern approach to criminal justice that aims to reintegrate offenders into society.</p>

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has expressed support for the new Olympic age limit, restricting competition to athletes 14 and older, starting with the 2028 Los Angeles Games. World Skate, the governing body, instituted the limit in April, which would have excluded some of Japan's past Olympic medalists. Despite the potential impact on medal prospects, Japan's street skateboarding head coach Daisuke Hayakawa endorsed the decision, citing concerns about injuries among younger athletes. While international tournaments will also have a minimum age of 12, domestic competitions in Japan will remain open to younger participants.</p>

          <p>Japan is implementing an amendment to the Penal Code, emphasizing rehabilitation efforts within prisons. This marks a significant shift from traditional punishment, aiming to reduce recidivism through tailored guidance and education. Imprisonment will no longer be divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work will not be mandatory. The new system includes 24 programs designed to address the individual needs of inmates, considering factors such as age and characteristics, to facilitate their successful reintegration into society.</p>

KoBold Metals plans to invest US$1 billion to develop the project, challenging China's dominance in the control of critical minerals essential for the global green energy transition.
