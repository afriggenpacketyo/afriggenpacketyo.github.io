          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Framework for Raising Successful Kids</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article introduces a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting," which focuses on being deeply attuned to a child's emotional needs and building emotional resilience, trust, and connection. Emotionally safe parenting sets clear boundaries while emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. It involves accepting a child's emotions, responding without shame, viewing misbehavior as a signal for support, and taking responsibility after conflicts. The author emphasizes the importance of parents doing their own inner work and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing their emotions. The author's tone is supportive and encouraging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open and discussed regaining his truck, which was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul changed banks and forgot to adjust automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in the repossession. He found out about the missing truck when his trainer asked him to check security camera footage, and Paul initially thought the truck had been stolen. He later posted footage of the repossession on social media. The author's tone is lighthearted and humorous.</p>
