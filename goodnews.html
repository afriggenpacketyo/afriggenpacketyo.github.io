          <p>A senior US State Department official reaffirmed India's crucial role as a democratic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region, despite existing bilateral trade disputes and concerns regarding Pakistan. The official underscored the enduring strength of ties with New Delhi, emphasizing India's integral position in the broader Indo-Pacific strategy. Plans are currently underway for a Quad leaders' summit to take place in New Delhi this fall, with a potential in-person meeting between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Prime Minister Narendra Modi being explored. This continuous diplomatic engagement highlights the US administration's unwavering commitment to fostering strong alliances and stability within the region, even amidst complex geopolitical challenges.</p>

The 53-year-old actress reflected on the couch's memories and her past struggles, including experiencing homelessness before achieving worldwide fame. Electra, who was discovered by Prince, also discussed her initial shyness despite becoming a prominent 1990s sex symbol. Coinciding with her personal transition, the original 'Baywatch' series is notably set to return to television on FOX with a new cast, aiming to reintroduce the iconic show to a new generation of viewers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 18:08:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A generic drug called leucovorin, typically used to ease chemotherapy side effects, has shown preliminary promise in helping children with autism improve their speech, with some parents reporting significant breakthroughs. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Richard Frye, who has studied the drug for decades, explains that it may bypass a folic acid transport blockage in the brain linked to some autism spectrum disorders. Despite promising phase 2B studies and five positive blinded controlled trials, larger phase 3 clinical trials are still needed for full FDA approval. Challenges remain, including securing funding for further research and ensuring consistent supply of quality formulations, as leucovorin is an inexpensive, older drug with limited commercial incentive for investment.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring options to provide financial support to companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyber attack that halted JLR car production in late August. Fears are growing that smaller suppliers, heavily reliant on JLR, could face bankruptcy without intervention, as factories remain suspended. Proposed solutions include the government purchasing component parts to sustain businesses or offering government-backed loans, though the latter is less popular. This situation highlights broader concerns among senior government figures about a pattern of cyber attacks on UK institutions and businesses, prompting urgent consideration of measures to protect the automotive sector and its extensive workforce.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Bears achieved a record-setting valuation of $8.9 billion following the NFL finance committee's approval of a 2.35% minority stake sale to existing team owners. This valuation represents a significant increase from the team's $6.4 billion valuation just a year prior. The sold stake, from the estate of Andrew McKenna, will be acquired by the McCaskey and Ryan families, increasing their ownership percentages. This deal surpasses previous NFL minority stake valuation records, reflecting the booming market for sports franchises. The Bears are also exploring building a new domed stadium in Arlington Heights, which could further enhance their revenue potential through year-round events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores China's Global Governance Initiative, which seeks to address critical deficits in current global governance mechanisms. The initiative highlights three major areas for reform: the underrepresentation of the Global South, the erosion of authoritativeness of international law due to unilateral sanctions, and the urgent need for greater effectiveness in implementing agendas like the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. China argues that the rise of emerging markets necessitates boosting their representation to rectify historical injustices. The initiative also emphasizes the need for improved governance in new frontiers such as artificial intelligence, cyberspace, and outer space, aiming for a more equitable and effective international order.</p>

          <p>A preliminary trial of the experimental gene therapy AMT-130 has demonstrated remarkable success, showing a 75% reduction in Huntington's disease progression over three years in high-dose patients compared to standard care. This one-time treatment, delivered via complex brain surgery, utilizes a harmless virus to introduce genetic instructions that effectively turn off the harmful protein damaging brain cells. University College London researchers reported that patients tolerated the procedure well, with manageable side effects. While these early results are highly encouraging, experts caution that larger studies are necessary, and potential FDA approval is still years away, but it offers significant hope for a condition currently only managed symptomatically.</p>

          <p>Medical professionals and public health officials are strongly refuting President Trump's assertion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen for fevers and pain. Doctors warn that untreated fevers during pregnancy can pose serious risks to both mother and baby, potentially leading to brain development issues or cardiac problems in the fetus. They emphasize that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain relief and fever reduction during pregnancy, unlike alternatives like aspirin or ibuprofen which carry significant risks. Experts are concerned that Trump's comments, which linked acetaminophen to autism without new evidence, could deter expectant mothers from necessary and safe treatment, leading to harmful outcomes.</p>

The National Hurricane Center notes that Humberto is in a favorable environment for intensification due to warm sea surface temperatures and mid-level relative humidity.

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a deal brokered by his administration that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, declaring it a "qualified divestiture." Under the agreement, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, will have its content recommendation algorithm copied and retrained to operate solely on US user data. Cloud-computing firm Oracle is slated to provide "top to bottom security" by hosting American user data and reviewing the app's code. A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok. While the White House expresses confidence in the deal's compliance with laws, some lawmakers, like Rep. John Moolenaar, voice concerns about potential ongoing Chinese influence, particularly regarding the algorithm.</p>

The White House seeks a small equity stake to create a cash buffer and reduce taxpayer risk, especially as loan repayments are pushed to later years.
