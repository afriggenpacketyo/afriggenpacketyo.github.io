          <p>During a recent visit to China, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed support for President Xi Jinping's vision for a multipolar global order. Anwar's backing of the Global Governance Initiative highlights Malaysia's alignment with China's strategic goals, which emphasize sovereign equality and multilateralism. This move signals a strengthening of ties between the two nations and reflects Malaysia's solidarity with the Global South in response to what it perceives as unilateralism from Washington. The diplomatic gesture underscores a broader trend of shifting geopolitical allegiances in Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>A registered dietitian suggests that certain carbohydrates rich in protein can aid in weight loss and muscle development, challenging the common perception of carbs as detrimental to fitness goals. Foods such as quinoa, sprouted grain bread, whole wheat pasta, chickpeas, and lentils are highlighted for their protein and fiber content. These options can help individuals meet higher protein intake targets, manage blood sugar levels, and maintain steady energy. The article emphasizes that incorporating these nutrient-dense carbs can be a practical strategy for achieving a balanced and effective diet.</p>

          <p>A man charged with stealing flowers from the public tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham has had the case against him withdrawn. Prosecutors dropped the charge after it was revealed that a security guard had given the man permission to take the items. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic chance of conviction because dishonesty could not be proven. The tributes were left by thousands of fans following the heavy metal icon's death in July at the age of 76.</p>

Starting in February 2026, the brand's collections will be available in 32 John Lewis department stores across the country. After the collapse of its parent company, Topshop was acquired by online retailer Asos, which has been working on a major comeback for the brand. This nationwide partnership with John Lewis marks a significant step in re-establishing Topshop's presence and aims to attract a new generation of shoppers.</p>

          <p>AC Milan midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek has been recalled to the England national football team after a nearly seven-year hiatus. His last appearance was in November 2018, before a severe Achilles rupture in 2019 derailed his career trajectory. The 29-year-old admitted he had "completely forgot" about international duty and became "just a fan" during his long recovery and subsequent move to Italian football. Now playing under former Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel for England, Loftus-Cheek credits his self-belief and resilience for overcoming the significant physical and mental challenges.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley analysis projects an improved outlook for China's major property developers in the latter half of the year, following a difficult first half. The report anticipates that the rate of decline in sales and profitability will slow, with a potential for sales to pick up in the fourth quarter. This optimism is based on a large inventory of completed homes in higher-tier cities and the expected start of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-cutting cycle. Developers have also provided positive guidance, expecting recovery in development margins and growth in rental income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to a common narrative that single, child-free women are happiest, a new national survey indicates that married mothers report the highest levels of happiness. The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to 10% of unmarried women without children. Married mothers were also most likely to feel their life has a clear sense of purpose and meaning. While acknowledging the challenges of motherhood, such as feeling overwhelmed, the research suggests that the profound sense of purpose and the companionship of marriage are significant contributors to overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>The location of Adolf Hitler's Führerbunker in Berlin, now a nondescript parking lot, attracts a steady stream of tourists despite having no visible remains. This phenomenon, known as "dark tourism," involves visiting sites associated with death and tragedy. For decades, German authorities resisted officially marking the site, fearing it could become a neo-Nazi shrine. In 2006, a historical association installed a single informational plaque to provide context and counter misinformation. The site's understated nature reflects Germany's ongoing, complex struggle with how to publicly commemorate the darkest parts of its history.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, Caltrans has proposed a $2.1 billion tunnel as a long-term solution for Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101 in Northern California. This highway is the only viable route connecting the remote community of Crescent City to the rest of the state, making it a critical economic lifeline. The road is built atop four active landslides and is constantly eroding, posing a severe risk to travelers. If funding is secured, the 6,000-foot tunnel would be the state's longest and could open by 2038.</p>

The promoters, who previously ran shows at the beloved but now-closed Bootleg Theater, have self-funded the new all-ages venue.
