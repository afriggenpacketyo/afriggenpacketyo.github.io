          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. Residents across the New York City area and New Jersey reported feeling brief shaking, with some describing it as feeling like a car had impacted their house. Despite the surprise and confusion captured on security cameras, authorities reported no injuries or significant structural damage from the event. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, this minor tremor was not a cause for major alarm, distinguishing it from the larger 4.8 magnitude quake that occurred in April 2024.</p>

This win marks the first time a Frenchwoman has won the prestigious women's race since its reestablishment four years ago. Ferrand-Prévot, who is also an Olympic cross-country champion, had shifted her focus back to road racing this season specifically to compete in Le Tour. She expressed that winning the race while wearing the iconic yellow jersey was a lifelong dream come true, capping a successful season that also included a victory at the Paris-Roubaix race.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 15:48:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the installation of new utility-scale solar energy, adding over 3 gigawatts of capacity last year. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which are capitalizing on solar energy's increasing cost-effectiveness compared to natural gas. State regulations that fast-track approval for projects under 75 megawatts have also accelerated development. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is projected to cause a significant drop in rooftop solar installations, and growing constraints on the existing power grid.

          <p>In response to devastating floods in Central Texas that claimed over 130 lives, CBS Texas and Chef Tim Love are hosting the "Loud for Love" benefit concert. The event aims to raise funds for flood relief efforts and will take place at Tannahill's Tavern & Music Hall in Fort Worth. Headlined by country artist Amanda Shires, the concert will feature numerous other performers and will be broadcast live, with a QR code for viewers to donate directly to the Salvation Army. An online silent auction with items like a Dallas Cowboys VIP suite experience will also contribute to the fundraising for affected communities.</p>

The illegal rave, held at the Cefn Croes wind farm, prompted Natural Resources Wales to advise the public to avoid the area due to safety concerns and potential environmental harm. Police monitored the gathering as attendees began to disperse throughout the day, with a small number remaining by late afternoon. Authorities emphasized the disruption such events cause and stated they will robustly investigate any criminal offenses connected to the illegal gathering.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion federal fund to support rural hospitals will be available in early September. This fund was established as part of a new law that also enacted significant cuts to Medicaid, prompting concerns about the financial stability of rural healthcare providers. Dr. Oz stated the money is intended to assist with workforce development, system adjustments, and the implementation of technology like telehealth. The law also introduces Medicaid work requirements, which the Congressional Budget Office estimates could lead to 10 million people losing coverage over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers managed to generate just enough offense to defeat the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, clinching a series victory and ending a nine-game road trip with a winning record. After struggling to score for 18 consecutive innings, the team manufactured runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and a key sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen secured the shutout. Despite the win, concerns remain about the team's slumping lineup, which has prompted manager Dave Roberts to experiment with the batting order, including swapping Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.</p>

          <p>A number of former career attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice are running for public office, motivated by what they describe as the politicization and dismantling of the agency under the Trump administration. These candidates, who have no prior political experience, are campaigning on their records as public servants and are openly critical of recent changes, such as reductions in anti-corruption divisions and the purge of the public integrity section. For example, former prosecutor Ryan Crosswell is running for a competitive House seat in Pennsylvania, while Erika Evans is seeking to become city attorney in Seattle, citing the administration's attacks on diversity initiatives as a reason for her departure.</p>

The baby girl, named Aine, was born while Kayla was en route to a hospital in New Zealand, where the family was visiting. Aki, who had been in Brisbane preparing for the first Test match, learned of the birth via a video call just before a team meeting.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts of less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that particularly large commissions could be considered unfair. The total cost of the scheme is estimated to be between £9 billion and £18 billion, which the industry will be expected to cover. The FCA will begin a consultation in October to determine eligibility and compensation amounts for agreements dating back to 2007, with the first payouts anticipated next year.

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's remote Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a plume of ash over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption, which was accompanied by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake, occurred just days after a massive 8.8-magnitude quake struck the same region. Russian authorities reported that the ash cloud was spreading eastward over the Pacific Ocean and did not affect any populated areas. While there is a discrepancy between Russian and U.S. sources on the exact date of the last eruption, both confirm it has been dormant for centuries.</p>

The Smithsonian stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for appearance and presentation, not because of any external pressure.

The win came despite a challenging start where Norris dropped to fifth place on the first lap after a tight battle with Piastri. Norris had to execute a difficult one-stop tire strategy to recover, a gamble that ultimately paid off. He admitted after the race that he has not been making his championship fight easy for himself and needs to improve in the second half of the season.</p>

This trend is a response to both the flavor preferences of younger, more diverse generations and a broader pullback in consumer spending.

The structure is now weather-tight, with key infrastructure like baggage systems and future ticket counters already in place.
