          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Ukraine can win back all its territory from Russia, including areas occupied since the war began. Communicating via his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump attributed his changed position to Russia's significant economic troubles, labeling the nation a "paper tiger." This new stance marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory to achieve peace, offering a more optimistic outlook for Kyiv's military objectives.</p>

          <p>Global defense company stocks surged following President Donald Trump's unexpected declaration that Ukraine is capable of winning back all its territory from Russia. This major rhetorical shift, coupled with his suggestion that NATO should down Russian jets violating its airspace, boosted investor confidence in the sector. European firms like Saab, Leonardo, and Hensoldt saw significant gains, as did major South Korean defense contractors, reflecting market anticipation of increased military spending and support for Ukraine.

In his discussion with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Li emphasized the need for both nations to act responsibly and for Ottawa to adopt a "correct" perception of China. The talks come amid a period of strained relations, which worsened after Canada imposed tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, steel, and aluminum, prompting retaliatory tariffs from Beijing.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting at the UN, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised President Trump's revised stance on the war, calling the shift "really big" and describing Trump as a "game changer." Zelenskyy suggested that Trump is now better informed about the battlefield situation, leading to his new declaration that Ukraine can win back its territory. The Kremlin responded by disputing Trump's assessment of Russia's economic and military weakness, associating the country with a "real bear" rather than a "paper tiger."</p>

          <p>The prospect of sending humans to Mars hinges on significant progress in space medicine, a field dedicated to understanding and mitigating the severe health risks of long-duration spaceflight. Astronauts face challenges like radiation exposure, bone density loss, and psychological stress, which are far more extreme on a multi-year Mars mission than on the International Space Station. Researchers are exploring solutions from AI-guided diagnostics to personalized countermeasures, as ensuring human survivability is a critical prerequisite for making humanity a multiplanetary species.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have edged slightly higher, with the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage rising to 6.39% and the 15-year fixed rate increasing to 5.72%. Refinance rates also saw a minor uptick, a common trend where they often track slightly higher than purchase rates. This movement occurs despite a recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve, indicating that broader market forces continue to influence long-term borrowing costs for homebuyers and those looking to refinance.

          <p>Thirteen years after the "Miracle at Medinah," the story of Rory McIlroy almost missing his Ryder Cup singles match remains a legendary piece of golf history. A then 23-year-old McIlroy confused time zones and required a high-speed police escort to make his tee time against Keegan Bradley, arriving with only minutes to spare. His subsequent victory was a crucial point in Europe's historic comeback, and the frantic event is seen as a key moment in his transformation into the passionate and unflagging leader he is for Team Europe today.</p>

The settlement is one of the largest for a wrongful conviction in state history, concluding a long fight for justice after decades of lost life.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a TikTok promotion for Au Vodka featuring former "Love Island" contestant Lucinda Strafford. The regulator concluded that the ad was inappropriately directed at people under 18, given the reality show's popularity with young audiences and the way TikTok's algorithm distributes content. The ASA stated that the company failed to provide sufficient evidence that it had taken adequate steps to ensure the ad was not seen by a younger demographic, in violation of UK advertising rules.</p>

This change is part of a national trend aimed at combating chronically low voter turnout in local elections. Proponents argue that consolidating elections significantly increases participation, especially among younger and minority voters, and reduces administrative costs, though some worry local issues could be overshadowed by larger political contests.</p>
