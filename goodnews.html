          <p>A planned trial to display political advertisements on convenience store electronic signage in Japan has been canceled by the association for digital transformation of policy and public affairs. The trial, scheduled to begin at FamilyMart stores in Tokyo, aimed to encourage young people's interest in politics amid low voter turnout, and the company official said that the dates were not met as they carefully considered whether to participate in the trial. The association announced the initiative on May 20, with members including lawmakers and advertising industry figures, and they held a press conference in the Diet attended by senior members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and opposition parties. FamilyMart will continue studying ways to improve voter turnout using digital signage, which demonstrates the store's commitment to contributing to the democratic process. The cancellation reflects the complexities and sensitivities involved in integrating political advertising into commercial spaces.</p>

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that while Huawei's Ascend chips lag behind U.S. chips by a generation, state-of-the-art performance can be achieved through tactics like "stacking and clustering." Ren's comments, in an interview with People's Daily, suggest that Washington's sanctions have not entirely hindered China's technological advancements, particularly in AI. He highlighted China's advantages in AI development, including a large young population, sufficient electricity, and a developed information network, and he also noted that there will be hundreds of open source software programs in the future to meet the needs of the entire society. The U.S. Department of Commerce has issued guidance indicating that the use of Ascend chips globally could violate American export controls, so Ren's comments come at a time when Washington is ramping up restrictions on China and Huawei Technologies is in the eye of the storm.</p>

          <p>Amidst protests in Los Angeles, U.S. officials have clarified the rules of force for the deployed National Guard and Marines, stating that their weapons will not be loaded with ammunition. These troops are tasked with protecting federal buildings and personnel, not patrolling streets or detaining protesters, and they will not use rubber bullets or pepper spray. The rules could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act, which he has not done, and the personnel are operating under rules that call for de-escalation. Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell emphasized the need for clear communication between agencies to ensure a coordinated response, highlighting the logistical challenges of federal military presence, and the military is defining the mission as non-law enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to curb rising prices, as announced by farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi. This move will leave the country with a 100,000-ton rice reserve, and the released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators and major retailers. Rice prices have doubled compared to last year, averaging 4,260 yen per 5 kilograms in late May, and the government expects the cheaper rice sold through direct contracts to lower overall prices. The released rice will consist of 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and the 2020 rice is expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kg.</p>

China's Foreign Ministry confirmed Vice Premier He Lifeng's presence in the U.K. for the talks, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated the U.S. seeks confirmation China will restore the flows of critical minerals.

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to "kickstart" economic growth, and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary for a "golden age of clean energy." Alison Downes, director of Stop Sizewell C, criticized the lack of transparency about the project's cost and incomplete negotiations with private investors. The government insists nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, but Sizewell C will take at least a decade to complete, and the final investment decision is due later this summer.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, will split into two companies by mid-next year, separating its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This move comes as streaming services gain popularity while cable TV audiences decline, and the Streaming & Studios business, including HBO Max, will be headed by Mr. Zaslav. The other company, Global Networks, will include CNN, Discovery, and TNT Sports, led by Gunnar Wiedenfels, and Warner Bros Discovery president and chief executive David Zaslav said this will empower iconic brands with sharper focus and strategic flexibility. The split follows the 2022 merger that created Warner Bros Discovery.</p>

The aircraft's distinctive features streamline the airframe while enhancing maneuverability, and the J-36's features are similar to the initial J-20 , which bore the number ‚Äú2001‚Äù.

          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use AI to automate routine tasks like marking and writing letters home, freeing up time for face-to-face interaction. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes that AI should only be used for "low-stakes" marking, and teachers must check the results for accuracy. Teachers are also encouraged to be transparent about their use of AI, and the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) acknowledges the potential for AI to free up time for teaching but notes that significant issues still need to be addressed. The Chartered Institute for IT also said it was an "important step forward" but teachers would "want clarity on exactly how they should be telling... parents where they've used AI".</p>
