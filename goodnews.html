          <p>Deion Sanders, the head football coach for the University of Colorado, has revealed he is now "cured from cancer" after undergoing surgery to remove his bladder in May. The procedure was necessitated by the discovery of a high-grade tumor, and Sanders confirmed he will continue coaching in the upcoming season, dispelling rumors of his resignation. The two-time Super Bowl winner spoke about the life-altering nature of the surgery and urged African-American men in particular to get regular health check-ups. His doctors confirmed the successful outcome at a press conference.</p>

          <p>Model and television personality Heidi Klum has responded to public criticism regarding a lingerie campaign she appeared in alongside her 21-year-old daughter, Leni. Klum stated she is proud of her daughter and that they are both comfortable with the advertisements for the Italian brand Intimissimi. She attributed their ease to her European background and having always been open about her body with her children. Leni, who began her modeling career at 16, has also previously addressed the backlash, stating she focuses on the positive reactions rather than the negative commentary.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, including Cheniere and Venture Global, saw notable gains after the European Union agreed to purchase $750 billion in energy from the United States. This major energy deal is a key component of a larger trade agreement between the two economic blocs. EU President Ursula von der Leyen stated the purchases are intended to diversify Europe's energy supply and reduce its reliance on Russian gas. The market's positive reaction reflects investor optimism about the future profitability of the American LNG export sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California first-year students, increasing the number by over 7% from the previous year. According to preliminary data, this growth was achieved while also increasing racial diversity and the number of first-generation college students. The university also increased admission offers to international students, a move intended to offset an expected decline in enrollment from that group due to higher tuition and U.S. visa policies. The data reflects UC's effort to balance public demand for resident access with its financial goals.</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 4% Rule and Its Application to Annuities for Retirees</h2>

          <p>This article examines the "4% rule," a common guideline for retirement planning, and how it applies to annuities. The rule suggests that withdrawing 4% of a retirement portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make the funds last for 30 years. When considering an annuity, this rule can serve as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from the annuity against a traditional withdrawal strategy. The article notes that while an annuity might offer a higher initial payout and protection against outliving savings, retirees must also consider factors like inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Television host Jim Cramer inadvertently used an expletive during a live segment on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday. The slip occurred while he was passionately discussing the new U.S.-E.U. trade deal and its associated tariffs. Cramer immediately cut himself off and offered a profuse apology on-air, while his co-hosts reacted with laughter. He later posted another apology on social media, attributing the gaffe to being "too effusive" while making a point about the economy, an incident that quickly drew widespread attention online.</p>

          <p>With the price of gold near record highs, investors are watching the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting for any indications of future monetary policy that could impact the metal's value. While a rate cut this week is considered highly unlikely, any comments from the Fed about future policy could still influence prices. Historically, lower interest rates boost gold's appeal, but recent price surges have also been driven by persistent inflation and geopolitical concerns. Given the multiple factors at play, the article suggests that the current price of gold could still be a strategic entry point. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite high U.S. tariffs on imported goods, some of Wall Street's most severe recession fears are beginning to subside. The recent U.S.-E.U. trade deal suggests that the effective tariff rate will likely settle in the 15-20% range, lower than the 25% or more that was initially feared. Economists now point to a strong global growth backdrop and a less severe inflationary impact than expected as reasons for cautious optimism. While the risk of a slowdown remains, analysts suggest the likelihood of a major recession caused by the trade disputes has diminished. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the reproductive health organization challenging a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to block its funding for one year. The judge stated that cutting off funds would likely lead to adverse health consequences for patients, including reduced access to contraception. This court order protects a critical funding source for Planned Parenthood while the legal battle over the "defunding" effort continues.</p>
