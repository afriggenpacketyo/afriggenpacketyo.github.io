          <p>Danish tennis player Holger Rune, currently world No. 11, openly discusses his clear ambition to win multiple Grand Slams and become world No. 1. Despite a strong head-to-head record against top players like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, Rune acknowledges his main challenge is achieving consistent deep runs in tournaments to frequently face them. He is working with coach Lars Christensen and has sought informal guidance from former world No. 1 Andre Agassi to improve his mental game and consistency. The article highlights Rune's determination to overcome his variable results and fulfill his potential in a highly competitive era of men's tennis.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant study by the charity GiveDirectly found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to over 10,500 households in rural Kenya led to a remarkable 48 percent reduction in infant and child mortality. This impressive outcome contrasts with recent US studies on basic income, which largely found null effects on health or well-being. While the exact mechanism is unclear, increased hospital deliveries and improved food security are potential factors. However, the article cautions that despite saving lives, the program's cost-effectiveness as a standalone life-saving tool is not as high as other interventions, underscoring the need for complementary health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A newly identified dinosaur species, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been named Istiorachis macaruthurae, honoring record-breaking round-the-world yachtswoman Dame Ellen MacArthur. The medium-sized herbivore, dating back 125 million years, is characterized by an "eye-catching sail" along its back, a feature that inspired the name's connection to MacArthur's sailing career. Dame Ellen expressed immense honor at the recognition, noting the poignant link between the dinosaur's sail-like formation and her life spent on the water. The fossil is now on display at the Dinosaur Isle Museum.</p>

          <p>Arm Holdings is highlighted as a compelling growth stock, driven by its power-efficient chip architecture that is increasingly adopted across mobile devices and data centers, especially for artificial intelligence applications. The company, which designs and licenses chip technology rather than manufacturing, is seeing soaring demand as AI platforms necessitate more efficient power consumption. Industry projections suggest significant market share growth for Arm in the data center processor market, with its Neoverse architecture purpose-built for AI. Despite a seemingly high valuation, its anticipated accelerated revenue and earnings growth could justify the investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified its previous directive regarding stray dogs in Delhi, now ordering that non-aggressive strays be vaccinated and sterilized before being released back to their original sites. Dogs with rabies or aggressive behavior will be immunized and housed in shelters. The court also banned public feeding of stray dogs, mandating dedicated areas for this purpose. This revised ruling, which animal welfare groups have welcomed as "balanced, structured and compassionate," comes after widespread protests against an earlier order to round up all strays, which raised concerns about overcrowding and culling.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles labor groups are pushing for a "New Deal" ahead of the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games, demanding significant commitments from the city and the LA28 organizing committee to benefit working people. Key demands include multi-billion dollar investments for 50,000 housing units, a prohibition on short-term rentals like Airbnb, and protections for immigrant workers from federal raids. Unions argue that past mega-events have often failed to provide lasting benefits for host cities, leading to displacement and debt.

          <p>A recent case of the plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident has raised public health questions, despite the disease being rarely contracted today. Experts explain that the plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, persists in wild rodent populations in the US, primarily affecting hikers and campers bitten by infected fleas. While the disease is treatable with antibiotics, it has not been eradicated due to the difficulty of eliminating it in mammalian populations spread by vectors. The article emphasizes that timely treatment is crucial, and although serious, the plague is largely under control as a public health threat.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is increasingly employing social media memes and aggressive rhetoric to counter President Trump, a strategy analyzed as a plausible approach in the current political landscape. From Photoshopped images to direct taunts, Newsom is mirroring Trump's own online tactics, engaging in what the article terms "meme wars." This approach, which bypasses rational thought to target subconscious perceptions, allows for plausible deniability while injecting specific iconography into public discourse. The article suggests that in an era where political combat skills resonate with voters, Newsom's willingness to fight on Trump's turf could prove effective, despite potential criticisms of his governing record.</p>
