          <p>The debut feature "Familiar Touch" is praised as a nuanced and empathetic film about a woman named Ruth, played by Kathleen Chalfant, moving into a memory care facility. The review highlights the film's departure from typical narratives about aging, instead focusing on Ruth's sensory experience and interiority with dignity. Director Sarah Friedland, drawing on her own experience in the field, creates a powerful procedural about caregiving while also delivering a sensitive portrait of a person navigating dementia. Chalfant's performance is described as brilliant and award-worthy for its profound humanity.</p>

          <p>The Glastonbury Festival continues to honor the memory of Joe Strummer, the late frontman of The Clash, with a dedicated stage called Strummerville. Run by his widow, Lucinda Tait, the intimate stage and its signature campfire aim to preserve the spirit of community and musical discovery that Strummer cherished. The area, located at the top of the festival grounds, was inspired by the campfires Strummer would host for artists and workers in the 1990s. It serves as a space for both established and emerging artists, continuing his legacy at a festival he deeply loved.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring debt settlement as a relief option. This article explains that while there is no official cap, settlement becomes less effective for debts exceeding approximately $100,000. For such large amounts, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, the required lump-sum payments become unrealistic for many, and fees from relief companies can be substantial. The piece suggests that settlement is most viable for debts between $7,500 and $75,000 and outlines alternatives like consolidation loans.</p>

          <p>Before achieving global fame as a novelist, Toni Morrison had a parallel career as a book editor at Random House in the 1970s, where she championed a generation of Black writers. A new book, "Toni at Random," explores how she fought to publish uncompromising voices like Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton for a mass audience. Morrison believed that literature written for a specific community could achieve universal appeal without diluting its integrity. Her work as an editor helped prove there was a broad market for Black literature, fundamentally changing the publishing landscape.</p>

The ruling ensures continued access to telecommunications services for schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers, affirming the FCC's role in managing the now-$8 billion program established in 1996.</p>

The U.S. personal saving rate has risen sharply this year, as consumers prioritize building emergency funds and cutting back on discretionary spending.

This cautious behavior is also reflected in retirement savings, with 401(k) contribution rates hitting a record high as workers focus on long-term financial security. (not investment advice)</p>
