          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking the Trump administration from implementing large-scale job cuts and agency reorganizations under its Department of Government Efficiency initiative. The judge stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that the President cannot initiate such reorganizations without Congressional partnership. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that Presidents have the authority to set policy priorities for the executive branch. The judge's order pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has called on Apple to begin manufacturing iPhones in the United States or face tariffs of at least 25% on those made abroad. This demand continues a decade-long effort to move Apple's supply chain, but the company has largely shifted production to other Asian countries like India and Vietnam. Experts argue that making iPhones in the US would be expensive and difficult, potentially doubling prices due to higher labor costs and automation needs. Apple's previous experience assembling Mac desktops in the US faced challenges, and the company may be focusing on future augmented reality products rather than long-term iPhone production.</p>

          <p>Data from the U.K. government reveals a surge in applications for British citizenship and the right to live and work in Britain indefinitely by Americans in the first three months of this year. The number of Americans applying for British citizenship reached a record high, with immigration lawyers noting increased inquiries following President Trump's reelection in November. The rise in applications is attributed to the political climate in the United States, with many seeking relocation options.

          <p>An etiquette expert suggests the best approach to splitting restaurant bills with friends is to communicate in advance to avoid awkward moments or potential conflicts. The most sophisticated way to handle this is to inform the server directly about separate checks at the beginning of the meal. If splitting the bill evenly, be mindful of others' consumption, especially regarding alcohol, and speak up if you don't want to pay for expensive items you didn't consume. Consider paying separately if you have children or know someone who tends to overspend.</p>

The purchase comes as stocks sell off in reaction to President Trump's tariff threats, causing Capital One shares to pull back after touching $200 per share. The Discover acquisition is expected to bring significant strategic and financial benefits, including $2.7 billion in expense and network synergies. Analysts estimate Capital One has substantial excess capital, potentially leading to significant share buybacks in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, published in The Lancet, also showed that this type of mammography can find smaller tumors than regular mammography, though MRI scans are slightly better at detecting tumors overall. Contrast-enhanced mammography is not yet widely used for screening in the United States, but experts suggest it should become standard care for women with dense breasts at high risk of developing breast cancer.

          <p>Kermit the Frog, the famous Muppet, delivered a commencement speech to the graduating class of 2025 at the University of Maryland, the alma mater of his creator, Jim Henson. Donning a tiny cap and gown, Kermit shared words of wisdom about life, dreams, and the importance of community. He encouraged students to write their own endings and to stay connected to their loved ones. The speech was met with mixed reviews, but Kermit's presence honored Henson's legacy and provided a lighthearted message for the graduates.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to its policy revoking the university's ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit argues that the policy violates the First Amendment and due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, and it would have a devastating effect on the university's international students. The university is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent the policy from taking effect. Shortly after the lawsuit was filed, a federal judge granted the restraining order.</p>
