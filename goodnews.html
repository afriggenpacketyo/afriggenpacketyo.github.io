          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. The site, which is over 3,000 years old and one of the largest in the valley, had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led conservation project began. The restoration involved more than 260 specialists and was praised for its high international standards. The tomb features a long, sloping passageway and chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings, offering a significant glimpse into the Eighteenth Dynasty, although its original contents were looted long ago.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced it has accepted parts of the Gaza peace plan proposed by President Trump, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other elements of the deal require further negotiation. In response, President Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, stating he believes Hamas is ready for a lasting peace. The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed preparations to implement the first phase of the plan, while the Palestinian Islamic Jihad also endorsed Hamas's position, signaling potential progress in the stalled negotiations.</p>

The Ghana international, who joined from West Ham for £55 million, has already made a significant impact with four assists this season. Manager Thomas Frank expressed his satisfaction, noting the club's high expectations for the player who has been their best offensive performer. Kudus's performance, which included setting up the first goal, has been widely praised for bringing a new dynamic of creativity and strength to the Tottenham midfield, especially amid injuries to other key players.</p>

Verstappen expressed frustration after his final lap was impeded by Norris, suggesting he could have contended for pole without the incident.

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. The future Hall of Famer's inclusion comes after he was left off the wild card series roster, and he is expected to provide a steady presence from the bullpen. His return is particularly important for adding left-handed pitching depth against a Phillies lineup with several left-handed hitters. The Dodgers also added left-hander Anthony Banda, while catcher Will Smith remains active but may not be ready to start Game 1 due to a hand fracture.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Stock Market Shows Resilience, Reaching New Highs Despite Government Shutdown</h2>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated notable strength this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieving record highs despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Analysts suggest the market has largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event, focusing instead on positive sector performance. Healthcare, utilities, and technology stocks saw significant gains, driven by factors like a deal benefiting pharmaceutical companies and the continued boom in artificial intelligence. The article notes specific corporate earnings reports and strategic stock purchases, reflecting a bullish sentiment among some investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to increase their exposure to overseas markets to counter a strong "home bias." According to research from ETF.com, the average U.S. investor is overly concentrated in domestic assets, potentially missing out on better value abroad. Emerging markets, in particular, are highlighted as an area of opportunity, with the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF recently hitting a 52-week high. Countries like India are noted for their strong demographics and rapid economic growth, presenting a long-term investment case similar to China's over the past two decades.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human smuggling charges may be an illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a discovery hearing after finding "some evidence that the prosecution... may be vindictive," citing the timing of the charges and public statements by Trump administration officials. Ábrego García was indicted shortly after he successfully sued the administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador and was returned to the U.S. The case highlights the intense partisan conflict surrounding the Trump administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand lower wheat and electricity prices and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands and pledged improvements in public services. The alliance leader urged demonstrators to disperse, expressing gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for addressing their concerns and working towards a resolution.</p>

Ryan contrasts his current lifestyle, which allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth, with his experience in the U.S., where he felt trapped in survival mode.

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of how he left a management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a then-small online bookstore called Amazon. Bill Gates reportedly called it the "stupidest decision" at the time, but Risher was convinced by founder Jeff Bezos's vision and customer-centric obsession. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it surpassed a year early. Risher, who became a senior vice president, found the opportunity to be part of such rapid, groundbreaking growth incredibly compelling and exciting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taylor Swift's new album has ignited fan speculation that the track "Actually Romantic" is a diss track aimed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The song addresses another singer who writes songs about hating Swift, which fans have linked to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying the album, Swift described the new track as "a love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the speculation, but the perceived beef has become a major topic of discussion among their respective fanbases.</p>
