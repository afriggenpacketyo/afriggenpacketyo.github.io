        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has initiated a revised system for selling government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices by early June. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the plan to sell rice produced in 2021 and 2022 at approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms through direct contracts with major retailers. This move bypasses the auction system, which was seen as contributing to rising costs, and seeks to address public concerns about inflation impacting household budgets. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to handle rice price issues and prevent consumers from turning away from rice products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Arlington National Cemetery to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and deliver remarks in honor of Memorial Day. Earlier on Monday, Trump posted a controversial message on his social media platform, Truth Social, wishing a "happy Memorial Day to all," while also targeting his political opponents. Memorial Day is a day to honor those who died in uniform as a result of battle, with the Department of Veterans Affairs estimating that over 650,000 U.S. military personnel have died in battle since the Revolutionary War.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 09:20:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail investors have been credited with successfully buying the dip during recent market volatility driven by tariff concerns, earning significant returns while institutional investors reduced their exposure. Data indicates that retail investors have poured over $50 billion into equities since April 8, capitalizing on the market's rapid rebound. This trend reflects a growing "buy-the-dip" mentality among retail investors, who often benefit from longer time horizons compared to institutional investors facing pressure to meet benchmark performance. Institutional investors are often benchmarked to the S&P 500 and face career risk if they underperform the benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 09:00:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When hiring a roofing company, it is important to understand whether they use in-house crews or subcontractors, as this can impact the quality, cost, and timeline of the project. In-house crews are full-time employees who have undergone vetting processes and training, ensuring consistent quality and safety practices. Subcontractors, on the other hand, offer more flexibility and potentially lower costs, but may present risks of inconsistency and varying levels of vetting. Choosing between in-house crews and subcontractors depends on individual priorities, with in-house crews offering more accountability and subcontractors potentially offering faster timelines and lower costs.</p>

Video footage of the incident circulated online, prompting initial denials from Macron's office before confirming its authenticity. Macron later told reporters that they were simply joking around and that reports on the incident were overblown. The Macrons' visit to Vietnam marks the start of a Southeast Asian tour aimed at positioning France as a reliable alternative to the United States and China amid ongoing economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation develops during puberty through a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, with no single cause identified. Research suggests that genetics, hormones, and social influences all contribute to an individual's sexual preference. While there is no "homosexuality gene," family studies indicate that genetics may play a role. Hormones and chemicals like pheromones also influence sexual behavior, and sexual orientation is considered stable throughout life, despite societal pressures. Understanding and accepting sexual diversity is crucial, especially in societies where sexual minorities face discrimination and persecution.</p>

This denial follows media reports suggesting that UK security officials are investigating a possible link between Russia and three incidents earlier this month. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that London tends to suspect Russia of involvement in all negative events in Great Britain, asserting that such suspicions are typically unfounded and lack evidence. Three men have been charged as part of a police investigation into the attacks.</p>
