          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable between South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project" will connect Chile to Australia with a 14,800-kilometer cable, improving connectivity and providing a faster alternative to existing cables connected to the US. The project is expected to benefit other South American countries, including Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil.

          <p>Italians are participating in a referendum that proposes halving the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum, initiated by a grassroots organization that gathered half a million signatures, aims to address obstacles faced by an estimated 1.4 million people in obtaining citizenship. Prime Minister Meloni and her colleagues are discouraging participation in the referendum, hoping to prevent it from reaching quorum. A successful vote could recognize the dignity and diversity of millions of residents and enrich Italy's national story.</p>

The last shot shows the unexpected arrival of a child who carries his blood, which was not even hinted at in ‚ÄúRogue One‚Äù (2016). The series has been officially presented to compete in 23 Emmy categories and celebrated through an event organized by The Paley Center for Media.

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels, making it the agency's largest operation of its kind. The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment. Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers studied feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, gaining insight into how feathers evolved during this era. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect us from dangerous infections. Good bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, appear to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery rather than caesarean.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline. The ruling halts restart efforts on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. Sable has been working to reactivate the Santa Ynez Unit, a complex of offshore platforms, processing facilities, and pipelines. The court's temporary restraining order will remain in effect through at least July 18.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss injections are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK say it's not known whether taking the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The UK drugs regulator, as well as doctors and pharmacists, are worried that popular GLP-1 medicines are not being used safely. As a precaution, women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant.</p>
