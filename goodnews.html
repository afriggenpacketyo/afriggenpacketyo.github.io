          <p>The Shanghai government has unveiled ambitious plans to expand its shipyard facilities on Changxing Island, aiming to solidify China's status as the world's top shipbuilder. The project seeks to create a world-class manufacturing hub for high-end marine equipment, with a focus on technologically advanced vessels like LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships. Within three years, the industrial cluster is projected to reach a scale of over 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion). The plan also aims to develop new vessel types and attract leading international institutions to its operations.</p>

          <p>A team of American archaeologists has discovered the 4th-century tomb of an early Mayan ruler at the Caracol archaeological site in Belize. The tomb is believed to belong to King Te' K’ab Chaak, the founder of the city's royal dynasty, making it the first confirmed royal burial found at the major historical site. The chamber contained numerous priceless artifacts, including 11 pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, and a mosaic death mask made of jadeite. The discovery provides significant new insights into the ancient culture and long-distance trade networks of the early Mayan civilization.</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. The TRF claimed responsibility for the deadly April attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 people, most of whom were Hindu tourists. U.S. officials described the TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, a UN-designated terror group. India's government welcomed the designation as a significant step in U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation, reflecting deepening ties between the two nations following the attack.</p>

          <p>Streaming service Netflix has for the first time used generative artificial intelligence to create final visual effects for one of its original series. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that AI was used to produce a scene of a building collapsing in the Argentine sci-fi show "The Eternauts." He stated the technology allowed the sequence to be completed ten times faster and at a cost that would have otherwise been unfeasible for the show's budget. This development comes amid ongoing controversy in the entertainment industry over AI's potential to replace human jobs and create content without consent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has developed a new type of infrared sensing technology that is reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional devices. The innovation was inspired by the fire beetle, an insect equipped with a specialized pit organ that allows it to detect faint infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. Infrared technology is crucial for military and industrial applications as it can penetrate obstacles like smoke and fog. This bio-inspired breakthrough could lead to significant advancements in clear imaging and accurate detection in challenging environments.</p>

          <p>Despite being engaged in multi-front wars and facing domestic political turmoil, Israel's stock market has reached a record high, outperforming all other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the Hamas attack, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has rebounded more than 200% from its low. Analysts credit the surprising economic buoyancy to significant foreign investment, a robust and dynamic technology sector, and renewed investor confidence following its recent conflict with Iran. The market's strength is also reflected in a threefold jump in new trading accounts being opened. (not investment advice)</p>

The inventor, identified as Zhang, said he was fascinated by a submarine he saw on a state television program and was inspired to build one himself. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) he scraped together, he secretly purchased steel plates, a battery, and an engine to construct the vessel. His homemade submarine has now been seen slicing through the water of a local river, becoming a source of amazement for his fellow villagers.</p>
