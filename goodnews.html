          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. The machine, composed of four modules manufactured across different countries, is more advanced and expensive than its predecessors. Intel was the first to commercially install High NA in its Oregon chip fabrication plant in 2024. ASML CEO Christophe Fouquet explained that advancements in machines like High NA drive down the cost of chip production, creating more opportunities. The article highlights how High NA improves chip speed, performance, and yield by projecting chip designs at a higher resolution. (not investment advice)</p>

This restructuring involves eliminating some roles while creating new ones, as Walmart adapts to the rapidly evolving technology landscape. Walmart, the world's largest retailer, has approximately 1.6 million employees and 4,600 locations in the United States.</p>

          <p>Alberta, a conservative Western province in Canada, is laying the groundwork to hold a referendum on seceding from Canada following a protracted political transition and amid concerns over President Trump's tariffs. The movement is fueled by a perception that the federal system unfairly limits Alberta's oil and gas resources. Premier Danielle Smith says she seeks leverage to renegotiate Alberta's relationship with the federal government, primarily to unshackle the province's oil industry from climate change regulations. Prime Minister Mark Carney, an Albertan native, is trying to balance addressing Alberta's concerns while maintaining national unity, with some Albertans open to joining the United States. </p>

U.S. President Donald Trump and his crypto czar, David Sacks, have supported a pro-crypto agenda.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to workplace expert Zach Mercurio, effective leaders excel at making small talk, which involves personal conversations that foster genuine connections with employees. Mercurio's research indicates that employees value these interactions more than traditional perks like promotions or pay raises. Meaningful small talk helps employees feel seen, heard, and needed, particularly for remote workers and those in underappreciated roles. By showing sincere interest in employees' lives and well-being, leaders can build trust and improve workplace rapport.</p>
