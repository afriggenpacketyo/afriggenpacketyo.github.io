          <p>Students in the UK who started secondary school during the COVID-19 pandemic have opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves four years ago. The letters, written just after a major lockdown in 2021, reveal their anxieties about the pandemic and their personal aspirations for the future. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill hope during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for the students as they prepared to receive their GCSE exam results. Their writings captured a unique historical moment, detailing experiences like learning in "bubbles" and their hopes for a post-pandemic world.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday. The stated goal is to pursue a direct peace agreement to end the war, a shift from previous discussions centered on a ceasefire. Trump indicated that the proposal includes security guarantees for Ukraine, a development European leaders were reportedly relieved to hear, though details remain vague. The announcement sets the stage for high-stakes diplomacy, with Zelenskyy previously being critical of any negotiations that occur without Ukraine's direct involvement.</p>

          <p>Guatemalan authorities successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by rioting inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots began in two separate prisons after gang leaders were transferred to a different facility and placed in solitary confinement. This incident followed an earlier hostage situation where 11 other guards were also freed. The events highlight the ongoing power struggles and violence between Guatemala's major gangs, Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha, as they vie for control within the country's prison system and on the streets.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond Westernized dishes to offer authentic, diverse regional cuisines from areas like Hunan and Xinjiang. Brands that found success in China's competitive domestic market are now using hubs like Singapore as a launchpad for global growth, testing their menus before expanding to other countries. This culinary wave is seen by some as a form of "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially softening China's international image and correcting long-held stereotypes about its food culture. These establishments focus on providing an immersive cultural experience alongside sophisticated and varied dishes.</p>

This era produced his last major hit, "Burning Love," and saw him grapple with the end of his marriage, which influenced his soulful ballad performances. The article reflects on this time, 48 years after his death, highlighting a missed opportunity to star in "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand. Friends believe the disappointment from losing that role contributed to a decline that preceded his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with an impressive 3-0 victory against West Ham, securing their first top-flight win in the month of August since 2010. After a scoreless first half, the newly promoted club dominated the second period with goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor. The decisive win confounded preseason predictions of a quick relegation and brought joy to fans who have endured an eight-year absence from England's top football division. The performance of several new signings suggests the club's significant summer spending may pay off in their bid to remain in the league.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung has seen a significant surge in its U.S. smartphone market share, rising to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share declined to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's gains reflect its strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own slimmer or foldable iPhone models in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has called on the UK government to immediately bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the "decimated" healthcare system in Gaza and urged that any bureaucratic barriers to evacuation be lifted. The letter calls for a clear timeline and adequate funding for the scheme, which the government has said it is accelerating. This humanitarian appeal comes as other countries, like Italy, have already begun evacuating a small number of critically ill individuals from the war-torn region.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. The comments came after Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which did not result in a ceasefire but shifted focus toward a direct peace agreement. Starmer commended Trump's leadership but emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The UK's supportive stance highlights a key European perspective on the high-stakes negotiations, reinforcing the need for continued pressure on Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising adults, particularly those over 60, to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. Maintaining muscle mass, including the heart muscle itself, is crucial with age, and protein plays a key role. Experts recommend consuming at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying, to reap the benefits.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the UK High Street, with its leadership confirming the future opening of new standalone stores. The brand, which was a cultural touchstone for a generation before its parent company collapsed in 2020, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years to signal its revival. Now owned by online retailer Asos, Topshop faces the challenge of recapturing its "cool" factor and appealing to both its nostalgic millennial base and new Gen-Z shoppers. The return comes at a difficult time for retail, but the brand hopes to fill a gap with its unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>
