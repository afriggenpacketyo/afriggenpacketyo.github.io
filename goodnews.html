          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher as investors processed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, though sentiment remained cautious due to ongoing tariff disputes. This uncertainty persists even after a U.S. federal court ruled that many of President Trump's global tariffs are illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. Investors are also watching key economic indicators, including South Korea's slowing inflation and Australia's current account balance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability affecting all four limbs, is raising awareness about the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. From door handles she cannot operate to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets, Tidball argues the building is failing to accommodate disabled individuals. While some minor changes have been made, she asserts that the institution that passed the Equalities Act 15 years ago is not living up to its own standards, making politics less inclusive for the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities.</p>

Built in 1904 from an estimated 10,000 trees, its design incorporates unique, twisted logs described as "freaks of the forest," creating a style that popularized rustic park architecture. For over a century, the inn has hosted millions of travelers, presidents, and royalty, surviving natural disasters while being meticulously maintained to preserve its historic character. Its influence is seen in iconic lodges across the country, cementing its legacy.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting any unaccompanied migrant child to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared to remove hundreds of children from the country. Lawyers for the children argued the government was attempting to circumvent legal protections that allow minors to seek humanitarian relief, such as asylum. The administration contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.</p>

          <p>Musician Tom Odell reflects on his career, revealing that one of his own dissatisfying performances in 2016 unexpectedly inspired Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas to pursue their music careers. Now, Odell is experiencing a resurgence, partly fueled by his song "Black Friday" going viral on TikTok and Eilish inviting him to open for her world tour. After leaving his major label, Odell has found creative freedom, channeling his anxieties about global uncertainty into his new, more confessional album, "A Wonderful Life," connecting deeply with a new generation of listeners.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with the total outlay for the summer transfer window exceeding £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by a series of major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool. This summer's spending significantly eclipses the previous year's total of £1.96 billion and is more than the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance in European football.

Analysts suggest the institution would help member countries insulate themselves from the risks associated with the US dollar-dominated global trade system. The proposed bank would also finance key infrastructure projects within the region, strengthening economic ties among member states.

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago, rewriting a key chapter of human evolution. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers determined the skull is at least 286,000 years old, placing it in the Middle Pleistocene era. This new, reliable age strengthens the theory that the fossil belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species believed to be the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. The findings suggest this archaic human population coexisted alongside emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe.</p>
