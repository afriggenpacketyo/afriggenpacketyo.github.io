          <p>Texas Roadhouse shares have been on the rise due to strong same-store sales growth, particularly in April, indicating continued customer demand for quality meals at fair prices. However, the restaurant chain faces challenges with rising beef costs and tariff impacts, leading to a revised full-year commodity inflation outlook of approximately 4%. Despite these cost pressures, analysts remain positive about Texas Roadhouse, citing its ability to offer value to consumers, but there are concerns that the cattle herd is not big enough. The company is carefully managing its position in light of these factors (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Making friends as an adult requires intentional effort and refined social skills, as many people feel disconnected from their friends.
