        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following significant public backlash against its brand modernization efforts, Cracker Barrel has announced it will suspend plans to remodel its restaurants. This decision comes shortly after the company reverted to its classic logo due to customer uproar that contributed to a substantial drop in its stock value. In a statement, the company acknowledged that the planned redesigns did not align with what customers love about the brand's 'Old Country Store' image. The chain had only remodeled four of its 660 locations before halting the initiative to refocus on its traditional appeal.</p>

          <p>In an opinion column, the author reflects on contracting COVID-19 despite being vaccinated, pushing back against claims from readers that this proves vaccines are ineffective. The writer criticizes the anti-vaccine rhetoric amplified by figures like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., arguing it undermines public health. Infectious disease experts are quoted reinforcing that vaccines were designed to reduce severity and prevent death, not necessarily to stop all infections. The article emphasizes that the vast majority of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated, highlighting the success of vaccination campaigns in mitigating the pandemic's worst outcomes.</p>

          <p>In an interview promoting her new children's book, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that the power for lasting change in the U.S. lies with its citizens, not the judiciary. She emphasized that while she can decide individual cases, it is the public that ultimately supports or changes societal norms and laws. Sotomayor declined to comment on a specific pending immigration case but encouraged Americans to read full court opinions from all sides to understand the legal reasoning. She also explained the function of the court's emergency docket, noting it is a process for bypassing normal lower court proceedings.</p>

          <p>Comedian Nate Bargatze, who is set to host the 77th Emmy Awards, has shared insights into his preparation and comedic style for the event. Known for his clean, observational humor, Bargatze stated his jokes will be fun and not mean-spirited, avoiding a roast-style format. He mentioned seeking advice from past hosts like Conan O'Brien, Stephen Colbert, and Jimmy Fallon, who all advised him to "just do you." Bargatze, who was the highest-grossing comedian last year, expressed that hosting a major awards show is a dream and an honor.</p>

          <p>Stage 16 of the Vuelta a España was shortened by eight kilometers after pro-Palestinian protests disrupted the race, with Egan Bernal ultimately declared the winner. Race directors decided to take finish times early due to a large protest near the original finish line, marking another disruption in a series aimed at the Israel-Premier Tech team. Previous stages have also been affected, including one that was canceled and another where a protestor caused a minor crash. Despite the interruptions, Jonas Vingegaard remains the overall leader of the tour.</p>
