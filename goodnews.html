          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," offers a fresh perspective on the lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is famous for his masterpiece "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the show highlights his unusual focus on male subjects in domestic and urban settings. This focus, particularly in paintings like "The Floor Scrapers," was controversial in his time and continues to spark debate about the artist's life and intentions. The exhibition aims to integrate Caillebotte more fully into the narrative of Impressionism, celebrating his unique and often sensuous artistry.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents devastated by the destructive Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support local restaurants struggling with decreased sales. The group, founded by a resident who lost her home, provides a vital economic boost and fosters a sense of community among neighbors united by tragedy. Members rotate through different local eateries, sharing meals and experiences, which mental health experts say is a crucial step in community healing after a disaster. The initiative serves as both a support system for survivors and a lifeline for small businesses trying to remain open.</p>

          <h2>New History of the U.S. Constitution Explores Its Enduring but Evolving Nature</h2>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," historian Jill Lepore reflects on the foundational American document as a living entity composed of evolving ideas. She describes the physical text as a relic made from parchment and ink, but argues its true substance lies in the concepts it established. Lepore contends that the Constitution's genius is its capacity to account for the passage of time, allowing it to endure and adapt. The book explores the historical struggles to amend the document and maintain its relevance for a changing nation.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out an AI-powered feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, voiced audio summaries of products based on catalog descriptions, customer reviews, and web information. While intended to simplify the shopping experience, the tool raises questions about whether it can replace the nuanced and often idiosyncratic insights found in human-written reviews. Analysts suggest the feature could dilute important context, such as safety concerns, and may unintentionally blend marketing language with genuine user feedback. However, it is expected to be particularly beneficial for visually impaired shoppers by improving accessibility.</p>

          <p>In preparation for the upcoming Ryder Cup at Bethpage in New York, Team Europe is using an unconventional training tool: virtual reality headsets that simulate a hostile crowd environment. Captain Luke Donald provided the equipment to players like Rory McIlroy to help them acclimate to the sights, sounds, and verbal abuse they anticipate facing on American soil. McIlroy revealed that players could customize the intensity of the simulated heckling, noting it was an effort to desensitize the team as much as possible before the tournament. This innovative approach underscores the team's focus on mental preparation for the high-pressure event.</p>

          <p>Ahead of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing pressure to secure a deal to remove U.S. tariffs on British steel. A Commons committee report highlighted the upcoming visit as a critical opportunity to finalize an economic agreement that would end the 25% tariff and provide predictability for UK industries. While a trade deal signed in June reduced tariffs for the auto and aerospace sectors, steel was excluded. The visit, Trump's second state visit to the UK, is seen as a key moment for high-stakes trade diplomacy.</p>
