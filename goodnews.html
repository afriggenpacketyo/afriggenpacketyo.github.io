          <p>Taylor Swift has shared details about how Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, among others, played a part in encouraging her relationship with tight end Travis Kelce. On the "New Heights" podcast, she explained that Reid, who has a long-standing friendship with her father, vouched for Kelce after he publicly expressed interest in her. Swift noted that many people close to Kelce reached out to her contacts, speaking highly of him, which she found unusual and touching. This network of support, rooted in Reid's connection with her family, helped lay the groundwork for their romance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Zillow analysis reveals that while the median price for a mansion in the U.S. has risen to $1.4 million, there are still a few metropolitan areas where homes over 5,000 square feet can be bought for under $1 million. Cities such as Buffalo, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, offer these large properties at more affordable prices compared to coastal markets where mansion values can exceed $4.5 million. This trend reflects broader real estate affordability, with less expensive markets in the Midwest and South providing more space for the money.</p>

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group experienced their largest single-day jump in five years after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new $1.6 billion stake in the company. The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid public backlash over rising healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices. The investment from the renowned investor is seen as a significant vote of confidence, potentially signaling a turning point for the embattled company and providing a boost to the broader managed care sector.

          <p>The FDA-approved nasal spray flu vaccine, FluMist, is now available for at-home delivery and self-administration for the first time. This new option allows individuals aged 2 to 49 in 34 states to order the vaccine online and have it shipped directly to their homes. According to the ordering platform, the vaccine is free under most commercial insurance plans, with only a shipping and processing fee. This development aims to increase accessibility to flu vaccination, though availability is currently limited in some states due to local pharmacy laws.</p>

          <p>Amid rising national credit card debt, this article explains how minimum payments are calculated and the financial implications of only paying the minimum. For a $3,000 balance, a typical minimum payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on whether the issuer uses a flat percentage or a formula that includes interest and fees. Sticking to minimum payments can trap consumers in a long-term debt cycle, costing thousands in interest over many years. The article suggests strategies like balance transfers, debt consolidation, or credit counseling to pay down debt more effectively.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues for Government Stake in Intel as Essential for US National Security</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument posits that government support is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturing, particularly from companies in Asia. While government ownership of private enterprise is generally disfavored, the analyst compared the strategic importance of domestic chip production to national defense, suggesting that federal intervention is justified to ensure a secure high-tech supply chain.

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has announced an agreement to purchase its rival, Hovis. The merger would create the UK's largest bread producer, surpassing current market leader Warburtons, though the deal requires approval from the competition regulator. ABF stated that combining the two currently loss-making businesses will allow for significant cost-cutting and improved efficiency. The move comes as sales for traditional pre-packaged bread have declined due to changing consumer preferences for specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across several counties in England, including Essex, Cambridgeshire, and parts of London. The Royal Air Force confirmed that three Typhoon fighter jets were launched from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. A sonic boom is created when an aircraft travels faster than the speed of sound, and the resulting noise caused widespread public concern and reports of shaking buildings.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to ever captain an England international cricket team. He will lead an understrength Twenty20 squad for a tour of Ireland in September, as many of the team's regular all-format players are being rested. The decision is seen as a significant show of faith in the young all-rounder's leadership potential, despite his limited playing time this summer and lack of senior-level captaincy experience. His appointment breaks a record held since 1889 by Monty Bowden.</p>

          <p>U.S. shoppers are continuing to purchase jewelry at a strong pace, providing a bright spot for brands like Pandora amid weaker sales in Europe and China. Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales for the second quarter, highlighting the American market as an outlier in global consumer trends. This strength is also seen in the luxury sector, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting similar gains. However, jewelry brands face challenges from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising prices for precious metals like silver and gold, which could impact future consumer demand.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) should act proactively to secure favorable returns. This article advises savers to shop around for the best available rates at different banks, as some may still be offering competitive yields. It also suggests re-evaluating one's budget to potentially lock in a larger sum for a longer term before rates fall further. Communicating plans with the current bank is crucial to avoid having funds automatically roll over into a new, lower-rate CD.</p>

Ramsey called her suggestion "ridiculous and insulting," affirming that self-employment is a real job.
