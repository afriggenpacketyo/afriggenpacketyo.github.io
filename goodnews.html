          <p>David Litt, a former Obama speechwriter, befriended his brother-in-law, Matt Kappler, a Joe Rogan fan, through surfing. Litt's book, *It's Only Drowning*, explores how shared activities can bridge political and cultural divides. Litt, a Yale-educated liberal, initially found Kappler's views and lifestyle unbridgeable, but learning to surf together provided neutral ground for connection. He argues for shared activities that allow for connection and understanding between individuals with differing views, emphasizing the need to find neutral ground and forget about the idea of common ground.</p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel *Audition* uses outer space to explore themes of exploitation and the possibility of new human connections. The story follows three giants, once regular-size humans, confined to a spaceship headed toward a black hole. The ship gets its power from their speech, which becomes a means of control, preventing them from realizing what has been taken from them. The novel suggests that even language can be corrupted and used for exploitation, but crossing the event horizon of the black hole offers a frontier of hope and the potential for new forms of association, free from Earth's prejudices.</p>

Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, hiring founder Alexandr Wang and his team, and plans to hire former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross. Meta is embedding AI across the company, from online advertising to the metaverse, but is considered a laggard in building fundamental models.

          <p>The Japanese and Indian governments are arranging for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Japan in late August for talks with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The two leaders are expected to agree on India's adoption of a next-generation shinkansen bullet train for a high-speed rail project in western India. They may also revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership amid China's increasing maritime prowess. The high-speed rail line will connect the western Indian cities of Ahmedabad and Mumbai.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are responding to criticism over their silence regarding immigration raids in the city by committing $1 million in financial assistance to affected families. The team will coordinate with the city of Los Angeles and trusted institutions to provide aid. The move follows pressure from fans and community leaders for the Dodgers to take a stand in defense of immigrants, but the author argues the team needs to do more to summon the moral courage of their past and set an example for other teams.</p>

          <p>The NHS plans to DNA test all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, with ¬£650m invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The scheme aims to ease pressure on services by providing personalized healthcare to prevent ill-health before symptoms begin. Screening will involve sequencing complete DNA using blood samples from the umbilical cord, and the NHS will need qualified professionals to interpret the data for patients.</p>

          <p>Japan has been quietly blazing a trail for supply chain resilience, becoming something of a canary in the coal mine for Beijing's mineral dominance. Following a heated territorial dispute in 2010, China implemented an export ban on rare earths that specifically targeted Tokyo. Alongside stockpiling, recycling and promoting alternative technologies, Japan has since invested heavily into non-China rare-earth projects. As a result, Japan's overall dependence on Chinese rare earths has dropped to below 60% from more than 90% at the time of the incident.</p>

          <p>A Scottish schoolgirl's message in a bottle has finally received a reply more than 30 years later after being discovered in Norway. Alaina Beresford, from Portknockie in Moray, sent the message in 1994 when she was 12 as part of a school project. It washed up across the North Sea where it was found by a volunteer cleaning up a Norwegian island, who then dispatched a postcard to the delighted sender to let her know. Alaina told BBC Scotland News she could not believe her original letter was in such good condition after three decades.</p>
