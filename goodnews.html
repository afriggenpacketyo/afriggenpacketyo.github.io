The plan's outline was based on extensive investigations during Xi's tours across the country this year. The Politburo Standing Committee made multiple revisions before presenting the framework to the Central Committee for deliberation. This highlights Xi's firm control and personal involvement in China's long-term strategic economic and social development.</p>

          <p>San Diego FC is set to make their first playoff appearance as the Western Conference's No. 1 seed, having broken MLS expansion team records for victories and points. The club attributes its success to a philosophy rooted in collectivity, analytics, and homegrown talent development, spearheaded by their Right to Dream football academy. This innovative academy, located on tribal land, offers five-year scholarships to residential student-athletes from middle school age. Their strategic cross-border recruitment, especially from San Diego and Tijuana, aims to tap into rich local talent and connect with the region's diverse cultural essence. The team, including star Hirving Lozano, is now focused on winning the MLS Cup.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a bionic jellyfish robot designed for stealthy underwater surveillance, developed by Tao Kai from Northwestern Polytechnical University. Described as an 'underwater phantom,' the drone's transparent, jellyfish-like design and near-silent operation make it ideal for covert monitoring of fragile ecosystems and underwater structures. Constructed from a hydrogel electrode material, the compact device measures 120mm in diameter and weighs just 56 grams. Its low power consumption further enhances its capability for extended, undetectable deep-sea missions. This innovation represents a significant advancement in bionic robotics and marine technology.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell has been elected the new deputy leader of the Labour Party, just weeks after being sacked from the cabinet by the prime minister. Her victory, though not a landslide, signifies an expression of the party's current anxieties as it faces declining electoral success and public attention. Powell's return to a senior, elected role suggests an attempt to address the party's recent rows and bungles, including controversies surrounding prominent figures and by-election losses. While she insists the situation is 'rescuable,' her ability to turn the party's fortunes around remains a critical question for its future.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, a 41-year-old entrepreneur, transformed a small eBay flipping venture into a multi-million dollar clothing resale empire, Technsports.

Senko initially focused on electronics but shifted to pre-owned clothing, building relationships with suppliers and listing thousands of items annually. In 2023, he transitioned to a wholesale model, selling bulk clothing to other resellers, which proved more profitable and less time-consuming.

          <p>Pablo Picasso's portrait, 'Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat (Dora Maar),' sold at auction in Paris for 32 million euros (about $37 million), surpassing expectations.

The painting had been in a private family collection since 1944 and had never been publicly exhibited, only seen in black-and-white photographs. Its sale marks the highest price for an artwork auctioned in France this year, underscoring its historical significance and the enduring allure of Picasso's work.

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents to avoid supervising their children's sports practices to foster resilience and internal motivation. She suggests that leaving kids with coaches and teammates, without parental oversight, encourages them to take risks, make mistakes, and develop self-starters. Wambach believes parental presence on the sidelines can 'outsource their motivation,' making children nervous or overly eager to impress. When attending games, she recommends deemphasizing winning and losing, instead focusing on leadership and good sportsmanship. This approach aims to help children become successful, self-motivated adults.</p>

          <p>Despite initial panic over AI advancements like OpenAI's Sora 2, which creates realistic videos, artificial intelligence has yet to significantly disrupt Hollywood's job market or drastically reduce filmmaking costs. Major studios, including Disney and Lionsgate, have invested heavily in AI but are struggling to integrate the technology into complex productions due to security, copyright, and technical quality issues. Actors' guilds are also resisting AI's use to replicate performances without consent. While AI tools are used for animation and dubbing, and some low-budget films benefit from visual effects savings, the technology is not yet 'Hollywood-caliber.' This indicates that human craftsmanship remains highly valued, though the industry continues its race to adopt AI.</p>

          <p>Amid growing investor interest in alternative assets like private equity, real estate, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, financial advisors recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for exposure. This strategy allows investors to access less-liquid alternative products while maintaining the tradability of ETFs. Younger generations, in particular, are showing disillusionment with conventional holdings, leading to a surge in ETF investments, especially in gold and crypto. Shifting regulations, including a Trump administration executive order to ease alternative products into retirement plans, may further expand access.
