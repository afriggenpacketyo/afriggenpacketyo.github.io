In light of this development, financial professionals advise investors to approach investments in futuristic technologies like autonomous vehicles with careful consideration. They recommend considering thematic ETFs to gain exposure to the sector, but emphasize the importance of examining the holdings of each fund to ensure it aligns with individual investment goals and risk appetite.

          <p>An international study led by the University of Edinburgh has presented evidence suggesting that the COVID-19 virus did not originate in Wuhan, China. Researchers analyzed bat coronavirus genomes and traced the virus's origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. The findings contradict assertions by the White House that a Chinese lab leak was the source of the pandemic. The study identified the virus's most recent ancestor circulating five to seven years before the pandemic emerged.</p>

          <p>New research reveals that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe ocean heatwaves, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter temperatures. Scientists observed clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea during a heatwave and found that individual fish got shorter over weeks. Being smaller may help warm-blooded animals cool down, and cold-blooded creatures meet their bodies‚Äô energy requirements. The study found that fish that shrank had a higher chance of survival.</p>
