          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting a claim from Exxon Mobil that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. The outcome resolves major uncertainty that had weighed on the transaction and affirms a standard industry practice regarding corporate-level mergers. Chevron's CEO indicated that some headcount reductions are expected as the two companies integrate their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:08:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can serve as a tool to supplement Social Security benefits and improve monthly cash flow. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert their home equity into usable income without having to sell their home. The article details three primary ways this can be utilized: creating a steady monthly income stream, accessing funds for unexpected healthcare costs, or enabling the delay of Social Security claims to secure higher future benefits. Repayment is typically deferred until the homeowner moves, sells, or passes away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Legal Experts Affirm Path Exists to Unseal Epstein Grand Jury Testimony as Requested by Trump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:08:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's call for the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related grand jury testimony, legal experts have confirmed that courts possess the authority to unseal such records. Typically, grand jury transcripts are kept secret, but a judge can order their release upon a showing of compelling public interest that outweighs the need for continued secrecy. In this case, Attorney General Pam Bondi is preparing to file a motion to request the unsealing. Former prosecutors suggest that since the government itself is requesting the disclosure and Epstein is deceased, a judge is likely to grant the request, though victim information would likely be redacted.</p>

          <p>According to a University of Michigan survey, U.S. consumer sentiment has improved for the second consecutive month in July, despite ongoing concerns about President Trump's tariff policies. This recent uptick follows six straight months of declining optimism, although the current sentiment level remains significantly lower than it was before Trump took office. Year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased, a positive sign for consumers. The data suggests that robust consumer spending, a critical component of the U.S. economy, has so far remained resilient in the face of economic uncertainty caused by fluctuating trade policies and potential price increases.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from her new book, "Me, But Better: The Science and Promise of Personality Change," author Olga Khazan describes her personal experiment to become more extroverted. As a self-described introvert struggling with loneliness, she decided to confront her social anxiety by enrolling in an improv comedy class, an environment that champions spontaneous interaction. The article details her initial discomfort and internal monologue during the class warm-up exercises, like the improv standard "Zip Zap Zop." It reflects on the challenge of stepping outside one's comfort zone and the structured, yet chaotic, nature of improv as a tool for personal transformation.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Delta and United Airlines Are Outpacing Competitors Through Premium Offerings</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, capturing over 86% of the sector's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong networks and a strategic focus on premium travel, including business class seats and lucrative loyalty programs, which provide a buffer against economic challenges. While the industry faces headwinds from weaker domestic demand for coach fares, both airlines have seen strong revenue from their premium cabins and co-branded credit card partnerships. This strategy allows them to maintain stronger financial performance compared to competitors focused on price-sensitive consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, a trip he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling incognito, Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, revisited the scenes of his youth as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its sense of freedom. The passage describes his mix of joy and disappointment as he found the landscape altered and the steamboat culture in decline. However, being back in the pilot house brought him profound comfort, allowing him to feel as though the intervening years had disappeared.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" includes a "no tax on tips" provision, but significant questions remain about its implementation and who qualifies. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028, while payroll and state taxes still apply. The IRS is expected to issue clarifying guidance in October, as tax professionals are currently uncertain about which occupations will be eligible. Ambiguity also exists regarding how the deduction interacts with new, higher income-reporting thresholds for forms like the 1099-K, which could affect gig workers and others.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following their performance at the Glastonbury festival. A criminal investigation was launched last month into comments the trio made on stage. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police determined there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence." The group, which had faced controversy for its pro-Palestinian stance and other political expressions, called the investigation an act of "political policing intimidation" and described their performance as a celebration of solidarity.</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-owned factories in Mexico will be excluded from the preferential trade benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Speaking at an expo in China, the envoy suggested that the upcoming 2026 review of the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for all companies rather than targeting specific countries. This means companies may need to source a higher percentage of their product components locally to qualify for benefits. The statement comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Washington seeking to limit Chinese economic influence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. Industry experts note that kids' content is effective because it is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which drives engagement and reduces customer churn. Data from Nielsen shows that children's shows and movies consistently rank among the most-streamed titles. As a result, major platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+ are investing heavily in their children's libraries and partnering with platforms like YouTube to maximize reach and discoverability among young audiences.</p>
