          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced its entry into the racing kart market, becoming the first major automaker to do so, with the goal of inspiring a new generation of auto enthusiasts. The company is developing karts intended to be affordable for families with children interested in motor sports, priced at about a quarter of the current market price, which is around 1.5 million yen ($10,400) in Japan. By making motor sports more accessible to children, Toyota aims to spark greater interest in automotive careers, hoping to inspire future drivers, engineers, and mechanics. The pricing and launch details are still to be determined as Toyota moves forward with this initiative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Harvard University's lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security, challenging the ban on foreign students, could quickly reach the Supreme Court, reigniting debates over judicial recusal. Four Supreme Court justices have Harvard affiliations, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, raising questions about potential conflicts of interest. While alumni status doesn't automatically warrant recusal, deeper involvement, such as Jackson's past service on the Harvard Board of Overseers, could necessitate it. The article explains that the decision to recuse is subjective and made solely by the justice involved, but the nexus between the justice and the specific interest in the litigation influences the potential for a conflict of interest.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggests the euro could gain greater international prominence amid global uncertainty and shifting geopolitical landscapes, particularly with the U.S. dollar's dominant role being questioned. Lagarde outlined that Europe must establish a solid geopolitical foundation, reinforce its economic base, and bolster its legal foundation to elevate the euro's status. A stronger euro could lower borrowing costs, insulate Europe from exchange rate volatility, and protect it from sanctions. While analysts are divided, some suggest investors may diversify away from the dollar, potentially benefiting the euro, and Nomura forecasts the euro could rise to $1.20 by year's end (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, exceeding economists' forecasts of 6.7%, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly expansion in the fiscal year 2025, driven by strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports. For the full fiscal year 2025, India's economy expanded by 6.5%, aligning with government estimates. While tensions with Pakistan and fragile ceasefires in Kashmir pose risks, improving consumer demand in rural areas supports continued growth, with the IMF projecting India's economy to modestly overtake Japan's, becoming the world's fourth-largest (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Amelie Mauresmo, the French Open director, responded to criticism regarding the tournament's night sessions, which have predominantly featured men's singles matches since their introduction in 2021. She justified the choices by stating that women's matches can potentially be shorter, with two sets going "really fast," and that the tournament avoids scheduling two matches in the night session to prevent late finishes. Mauresmo emphasized that the decision-making process involves many considerations and that it's not possible to satisfy every aspect, pointing to the full crowd at a recent men's match as evidence of its success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores why millennials are increasingly hesitant about having children, citing factors beyond financial concerns and career priorities. The author suggests that redefined standards for parenting, including expectations for emotional support and accountability for children's mental health, contribute to this trend. The essay also highlights the growing phenomenon of adult children cutting off contact with parents, often citing emotional abuse or toxicity, which creates a new, almost impossible standard for parenting. This cultural shift leads many millennials to question whether they can meet these heightened expectations.</p>

The author, a cancer survivor, describes the frustration of dealing with patchy hair growth and the pressure to return to normalcy. Dermatologists emphasize that hair is deeply tied to identity and confidence, and hair loss can have a significant psychosocial impact, particularly for women. Despite various treatments, guaranteed solutions for hair regrowth are scarce, and the author shares her personal experiences with both the physical and emotional aspects of this journey.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of animal instincts through an interview with neuroscientist Mark Blumberg, who argues that the term "instinct" is often misused and confusing. Blumberg suggests using the phrase "species-typical" behavior instead, as it avoids presumptions about the behavior's origin or control. He emphasizes that behaviors are complex and shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and learning. The discussion covers examples such as tailorbirds building nests and dogs herding sheep, highlighting the interplay between an animal's body, its environment, and its experiences in shaping behavior.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is initiating the implementation of Measure G, a voter-approved reform aimed at transforming county governance, through the creation of a Governance Reform Task Force. The measure seeks to address the county's challenges by expanding the Board of Supervisors from five to nine members and establishing an elected county executive to separate executive and legislative powers. This reform aims to create a more accountable and efficient government capable of addressing pressing issues such as homelessness and emergency response. The task force will also define the scope of a new independent ethics commission, and community engagement is encouraged to shape the future of county government.</p>
