          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a historic high, closing above the 45,000 mark, leading gains across Asia-Pacific markets. The surge was partly influenced by President Donald Trump's positive comments on U.S.-China trade negotiations and a framework deal concerning the divestment of TikTok. Other regional markets showed mixed results, with South Korea's Kospi also hitting a new record, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw slight declines. The positive sentiment followed gains on Wall Street as investors anticipated an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the UK includes a detailed schedule of royal ceremony and political meetings, beginning with his arrival and a private evening at Windsor Castle. The following days will feature a formal greeting by King Charles, a carriage procession, a state banquet, and bilateral talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers. Key topics for discussion include new investment deals in technology and energy, the ongoing war in Ukraine, and differing stances on Palestinian statehood. The visit is carefully orchestrated to balance diplomatic substance with traditional British pageantry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings growth data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the "triple lock" policy, the pension rises annually by the highest of inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%. This increase would raise the new flat-rate state pension by over £500 a year, bringing it closer to the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. Experts warn this will pull more pensioners into paying income tax, a concern shared by retirees who feel the benefit of the raise is diminished by taxation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom arrives at a critical time for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whose government is facing mounting domestic crises. This article suggests the pomp and ceremony of the visit offer a welcome distraction from recent cabinet resignations, scandals, and declining approval ratings. Starmer is expected to leverage the visit to announce new trade and investment deals, particularly in technology and energy, to project an image of stability and strength. Despite their political differences, Trump and Starmer have an apparently amicable relationship, which the British government hopes will yield positive outcomes and provide a much-needed political respite.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on a decisive 80-yard drive in the final minutes, culminating in a Rachaad White touchdown run with just six seconds remaining to defeat the Houston Texans 20-19. The victory marked the second consecutive week Mayfield has engineered a game-winning drive in the final minute of play. A crucial 15-yard scramble by Mayfield on a fourth-and-10 kept the final drive alive. The Texans had taken a late lead with 2:10 left on a touchdown run by Nick Chubb but failed on a subsequent two-point conversion attempt.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will create a legal "duty of candour," compelling public officials and bodies to cooperate truthfully with investigations into major disasters. Those who breach this duty could face criminal sanctions, a measure designed to end a "culture of cover-ups." The legislation, long championed by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, will also provide legal funding for those affected by state-related tragedies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the law honors the Hillsborough victims and is also intended for victims of other major scandals.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly using science and technology to monitor athletes' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of overall health and performance. By tracking cycles through apps and daily wellness forms, teams can make informed adjustments to training intensity, nutrition, and recovery protocols. This data-driven approach helps mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps, with some teams even developing nutritional supplements like "Sylvia's Cramp Cocktail." The goal is not to sideline players, but to provide cycle-informed support, ensuring athletes can perform at their peak throughout tournaments like the Women's Rugby World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers' defense delivered a masterful performance, securing a 20-9 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders. The tone was set on the first play from scrimmage when linebacker Daiyan Henley, despite battling an illness, intercepted a pass. The defense held the Raiders to just 218 total yards and recorded three interceptions, suffocating their offense throughout the game. Quarterback Justin Herbert contributed 242 passing yards and two touchdowns. The win was a significant one for coach Jim Harbaugh in his rivalry with Raiders coach Pete Carroll, giving the Chargers a strong 2-0 start to the season.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to eliminate the "not proven" verdict from its unique three-verdict legal system. Critics argue the verdict is confusing and stigmatizing, while some defense lawyers believe it offers an additional safeguard for the accused. To balance its removal, the bill also proposes raising the jury majority required for a guilty verdict from a simple majority to two-thirds. The wide-ranging legislation also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and the establishment of a victims and witnesses commissioner.</p>

In an article published in the Communist Party's main theoretical journal, Xi outlined key tasks, with a primary focus on curbing excessive and destructive price competition among domestic firms. He urged industry associations to guide companies toward prioritizing product quality over simply offering the lowest price. The directive aligns with previous government calls to phase out obsolete industrial capacity and crack down on cutthroat business practices. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement was reached during trade negotiations in Madrid and is expected to be finalized in a call between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. This development could pave the way for American ownership of the popular social media app, resolving a long-standing dispute centered on U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.

Participants reported sleeping better, spending more time on other hobbies like baking, and having more conversations with their parents. While some found the lack of privacy for calls with friends difficult, the overall experience highlighted their reliance on tech for social connection and revealed benefits to setting digital boundaries.</p>

While Ohtani's role as a two-way player presents logistical and rule-based challenges for relief appearances, his experience closing out Japan's World Baseball Classic victory makes it a compelling option.
