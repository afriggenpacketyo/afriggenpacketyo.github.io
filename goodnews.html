          <p>Japan has begun requiring pre-arrival tuberculosis screenings for foreigners planning to stay longer than three months, starting with individuals from the Philippines and Nepal. Vietnam is expected to be added to the list in September, followed by Indonesia, Myanmar, and China, due to the increasing number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB while in Japan, primarily from these six countries. The new rule mandates that citizens from the Philippines and Nepal provide evidence of being TB-free before entering Japan, or they will be denied entry. While TB is curable, it remains a significant global health concern, having killed an estimated 1.25 million people in 2023. </p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, which includes measures to lower energy costs for over 7,000 businesses by exempting them from certain green energy levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms, while energy-intensive firms will see increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending, with emphasis on sectors like advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and digital technologies. While some business sectors welcome the move, others such as retail and leisure are unhappy with the proposed plans.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national investigation into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS to families who have suffered avoidable harm and stated that the investigation aims to provide them with the truth and accountability they deserve. The review will involve victims of maternity scandals, giving families a voice into how the inquiry is run, with the goal of ensuring no parent or baby is ever let down again.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader Thune emphasizes the Senate's focus on passing a Republican bill aimed at bolstering American strength, security, and prosperity through border security, military funding, and tax cuts. The bill seeks to fully fund the border wall and extend President Trump's policies, while also investing in defense capabilities, such as missile defense systems and new ships. It also aims to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, preventing a tax increase for American families and small businesses, and includes reforms to government spending on programs like Medicaid. Thune anticipates Democratic opposition but remains confident in passing the bill to ensure safety and prosperity for future generations.</p>

The remains and artifacts belong to the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which lived in the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries.

          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical dilemma of enforcing rules against AI-generated writing, as students increasingly view it as acceptable. The article delves into the purpose of humanities education, arguing that its true value lies in the formation of human persons and the cultivation of virtues like practical wisdom. The rise of AI challenges this vision, as students question the value of traditional assignments when AI can efficiently produce the required outputs. The author suggests incorporating AI into the curriculum by allowing students to use it while also requiring reflection on how it impacts their thinking and learning process.</p>

The survey, conducted in multiple languages, found strong support across various demographics, with Democrats and independent voters showing the most enthusiasm.
