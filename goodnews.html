          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 13:24:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly, marking its largest one-day drop in over a year and reaching the lowest point since early October. This sharp decline to 6.29% was a direct market reaction to a weaker-than-anticipated August employment report, which eased concerns about aggressive Federal Reserve policies. The rate drop provides potential relief for homebuyers facing high property prices, reducing monthly payments on a typical home loan. However, it remains uncertain if this decrease is substantial enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand, which has recently been sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced the seizure of over 40,000 pounds of cocaine in the Eastern Pacific Ocean as part of its intensified Operation Pacific Viper counter-drug initiative. The operations, which occurred over the last month, also resulted in the apprehension of 36 suspected smugglers. The agency released images from the missions, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted. This surge in enforcement aims to disrupt narcotics trafficking from South America before it reaches U.S. shores, complementing similar heightened operations in the Caribbean.</p>

Scientists are using the opportunity to study the comet's composition and chemistry to understand how it changes during its journey through our solar system. The rare visitor poses no threat to Earth and is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her decades-long career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." Gibson, who at 17 became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard number-one hit, credits her late mother for her early success. She recalls how her mother, acting as her manager, fought for her to have creative control against industry executives. Gibson discusses how maintaining her independent spirit has allowed her to thrive in recent years, connecting directly with audiences and continuing to create music on her own terms.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has withdrawn from Great Britain's team for the upcoming Billie Jean King Cup Finals. She has instead accepted a wildcard entry to the Korea Open, prioritizing the WTA Tour event to aid the long-term development of her game. This decision is also intended to build her partnership with new coach Francisco Roig. Raducanu's absence is a significant setback for the British team's chances in the competition, where she was a key player in their semi-final run last year.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot, which has swelled to an estimated $1.8 billion, is providing a significant business boost for DraftKings' lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The company reported that 15 million tickets have been ordered through the app during the current jackpot run, with sales increasing 130% in a single day this week. This surge highlights the growing market for online lottery services. For DraftKings, the acquisition of Jackpocket is a key strategy to cross-sell its sports betting and iGaming products to a new base of lottery-playing customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winner of the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot will face a substantial tax liability, significantly reducing the final take-home amount. If the winner chooses the lump-sum cash option, estimated at $826.4 million, there is a mandatory 24% federal withholding, immediately cutting the prize by nearly $200 million. However, because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, millions more will be owed at tax time. State taxes could further reduce the prize, depending on where the winning ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a controversial local law that banned homeless shelters, settling a lawsuit filed by the state. Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the settlement, which requires the city to formally rescind the ban, dedicate $250,000 to affordable housing, and accept increased state monitoring. The state had sued the Los Angeles County community, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. Norwalk leaders had previously defended the ban as a response to what they called broken promises from other agencies to help with the city's homeless population.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching a historic $1.8 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can dramatically affect their net winnings. After federal taxes are deducted, the final payout varies based on state income tax laws. States with no income tax, such as Florida, Texas, and Washington, offer the highest potential take-home amount. In contrast, states with high income taxes, like New York, would see the annuitized payout reduced by over $160 million compared to tax-free states. The analysis also highlights which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently in the game's history.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprise-released "Swag II," a 23-track follow-up to his "Swag" album from just two months prior. The new record largely continues in the same musical vein, featuring Bieber's vocals over indie rock and 80s R&B-influenced productions. This sound marks a departure from his earlier pop and EDM hits but is familiar to fans of his more experimental projects like "Journals." The album features collaborations with artists such as Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris, and continues to explore themes of marriage, fatherhood, and religion in his lyrics.</p>

He has been released from the T20 squad for the series against Ireland, allowing him to play in the County Championship for his club, Durham. This move is intended to give him more red-ball match practice. Potts's chances are boosted by the recent retirement of rival Jamie Overton from red-ball cricket and an injury to Chris Woakes, potentially opening up a pace bowling spot in the Ashes squad.</p>

He used the speech to rally supporters, reiterating key policy goals like stopping illegal immigration, scrapping net-zero policies, and implementing "zero tolerance policing."

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing an executive order that will create a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens, allowing for punitive measures against them. The new policy, modeled after the "state sponsors of terrorism" list, would provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations that use detained Americans for political leverage. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and has been praised by the family of Robert Levinson, an American who died in Iranian custody. The order follows several high-profile prisoner swaps with countries like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela.</p>
