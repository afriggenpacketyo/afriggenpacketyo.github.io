          <h2>Taiwan Dollar Weakens After Record Gains Amid Currency Talk Speculation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 10:31:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge against the U.S. dollar, fueled by speculation that Washington was pressuring Taiwan to strengthen its currency to win trade concessions from U.S. The currency weakened over 3% on Tuesday, following a 9% rally over the previous two days. While officials deny currency rates are part of trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical given the central bank's limited intervention. The article suggests the pullback was driven by importers' increased demand for U.S. dollars, and the central bank may be allowing a currency realignment. Optimism is tempered by economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the shingles vaccine may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The research, published in the European Heart Journal, examined data from over 1 million people aged 50 or older and found a 23% lower risk of heart disease in vaccinated individuals. The protective effect was more pronounced in men, younger individuals, and those with unhealthy habits. Experts suggest the vaccine's impact on chronic inflammation could be a key factor in reducing heart issues.</p>

          <p>The Haenyeo divers of Jeju Island, South Korea, may have evolved genetic adaptations that allow them to dive for longer periods. A transatlantic research team found the Haenyeo's generations-long cultural practice has helped them develop adaptations enabling them to dive longer than other humans. They have also evolved genetically to have lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance. The researchers' findings mean the Haenyeo are one of only two groups of people known to have, quite literally, evolved to dive.</p>
