          <h2>UK Government to Establish New Water Ombudsman to Address Consumer Complaints and Industry Failings</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to create a new water ombudsman to handle consumer issues such as leaks, incorrect billing, and pollution. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and record sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has set a target to halve sewage spills by 2030. While the move is seen as a step towards accountability, critics argue that more fundamental reforms are needed to address the industry's deep-seated problems.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:12:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new mural immortalizing the late baseball legend Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, nine months after his passing. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork captures the iconic pitcher and celebrates his profound impact on the sport and the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, was a cultural phenomenon whose success sparked "Fernandomania" and forged a strong connection between the team and its Latino fanbase. The mural serves as a vibrant tribute to his legacy of unity and triumph over adversity.</p>
