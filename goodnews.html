          <p>South Korea is holding a snap presidential election following the ousting of Yoon Suk Yeol for attempting to establish martial law in December. Left-leaning Lee Jae-myung is favored to win the vote against conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo, whose party is experiencing internal strife. Roughly 71.5% of South Koreans have already cast ballots, with observers anticipating results by midnight. Some 44.4 million South Koreans are eligible to vote.</p>

This trilateral partnership aims to reduce reliance on the US market by diversifying supply chains and focusing on complementary strengths. Asean's resources, the GCC's financial clout, and China's manufacturing dominance can forge a robust supply chain ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in Havering-atte-Bower, east London, are being kept indoors due to a dive-bombing buzzard nesting in the playground. The bird, nicknamed Brenda by the students, is believed to be guarding its nest and has reportedly swooped on residents in the village. Havering Council has provided advice to the school, including the use of legal deterrents and hiring a falconry expert. The school is embracing the situation as a learning experience, with pupils creating art and stories about the buzzard.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to a post-race analysis. The first mistake was ordering Max Verstappen to give back his position to George Russell after an incident at Turn One, a decision based on recent penalty precedents. The stewards later ruled that no further action was needed, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. The second error was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision that Verstappen immediately questioned and that Red Bull later admitted was incorrect.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae-myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. An electoral win for the Democratic Party candidate would set him up to be the country's next leader after ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol. The Gallup poll reportedly showed that 49% of respondents were in favor of the liberal candidate becoming president, compared with 35% for his closest rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group also placed Lee as the "clear favorite" to win the election, putting his odds of victory at 80%.</p>
