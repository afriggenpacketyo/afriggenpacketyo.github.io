          <p>Eluned Morgan, the First Minister of Wales, has declared her intention to "call out" the UK Labour Party if its policies are detrimental to Wales. Morgan emphasized that she would "not stay silent" if the UK government makes decisions that harm Welsh communities. She specifically urged UK ministers to reconsider cuts to winter fuel payments and expressed skepticism regarding plans to reduce disability benefits, suggesting they are unlikely to promote employment. Additionally, she advocated for Wales to benefit more from wind power revenue generated through the Crown Estate.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge following the release of their first-quarter sales figures, which showed a smaller decline than anticipated, and the company reaffirmed its full-year guidance despite economic uncertainties. Revenues decreased by 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, totaling 999 million euros, slightly exceeding analysts' forecasts. The weaker sales were primarily attributed to reduced demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to consumer uncertainty. The company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and global trade tensions, which have already impacted demand.</p>

          <p>The acquisition of Deliveroo by DoorDash underscores the diverging fortunes of US and UK stock markets and the increasing trend of companies shunning the London Stock Exchange for US listings. DoorDash's financial strength, bolstered by higher valuations and greater investor appetite in the US, enabled the takeover. This deal exemplifies a broader issue where UK companies struggle to compete with their US counterparts due to valuation disparities and a shrinking appetite for UK stocks among domestic investors. The government is attempting to address this through reforms aimed at making UK listings more attractive.</p>

          <p>China's tourism sector saw a rebound during the Labour Day holiday, with visitor numbers surpassing pre-pandemic levels. However, spending per capita remained below 2019 figures, indicating potential stagnation and a shift towards less traditional destinations. These mixed signals, combined with recovering retail sales, a consumer goods trade-in program, and a housing crisis, create uncertainty about the state of China's economy. While tourism and domestic consumption are improving, deflationary pressures and consumption downgrading persist.</p>

          <p>The REAL ID deadline has finally arrived after 20 years of delays and resistance from states concerned about cost, privacy, and documentation burdens. The law, aimed at making state-issued IDs more secure and verifiable, has resulted in a variety of REAL ID "flavors" across states. While millions have yet to apply for REAL ID-compliant licenses, the enforcement of the deadline is already facing pushback. The Trump administration is also pressuring states that issue licenses to residents without checking immigration status, potentially impacting those who lack legal status in the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's economic narrative is shifting from a focus on supply-side reform to prioritizing demand-side reform. While China has achieved significant success in boosting productivity and developing new technologies, its strength in demand has not kept pace. The Communist Party's Politburo has signaled a potential turning point, emphasizing the need to boost household income and consumption. This shift reflects the understanding that supply-side success does not automatically translate into strength in demand, and a new approach is needed to sustain economic growth.</p>

          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to modernize approximately 1,000 GP surgeries in England, aiming to improve facilities and expand clinical spaces. This investment is intended to address concerns about GP service satisfaction and the suitability of practice buildings. While the government acknowledges this is a significant step, it also cautions that it won't solve all existing problems immediately. The Royal College of GPs welcomes the funding as an encouraging interim measure, but emphasizes the need for long-term investment to address inadequate infrastructure.</p>
