          <p>A US appeals court temporarily blocked a lower court ruling that invalidated most of President Trump's tariffs.  The Trump administration argued that the lower court's decision was an example of judicial overreach and threatened to disrupt trade negotiations.  The appeals court's decision allows the tariffs to remain in effect for now, while the legal challenge continues.  The case is expected to eventually reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Scientists have sonified data from the European Space Agency's Swarm mission, representing the Laschamps geomagnetic reversal 41,000 years ago through natural sounds. This event caused a significant weakening of the magnetic field, increasing cosmic ray exposure and potentially impacting climate and megafauna extinction. The resulting soundscape provides a unique auditory experience of this geological event.  The research helps scientists better understand and predict future magnetic field fluctuations.</p>
