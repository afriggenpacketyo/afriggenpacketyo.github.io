          <p>Following a national outcry, the Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl and her family, who came to the U.S. in 2023 seeking medical care for a rare condition. The family's humanitarian parole was initially terminated, leading to a deportation order, but doctors warned that the girl would likely die if forced to return to Mexico. Democratic lawmakers intervened, urging the Department of Homeland Security to extend the family's legal status, emphasizing the need for humanitarian aid. The administration has now granted the family humanitarian parole for one year, effective June 2, 2025, allowing the child to continue receiving life-saving treatment.</p>

Senate Bill 243 would require operators of companion chatbot platforms to remind users every three hours that the virtual characters are not human. Platforms would also need to implement protocols for addressing suicidal ideation expressed by users, including providing suicide prevention resources.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo in 2018 following a scandal involving the creation of fake accounts. The asset restriction, which limited the bank's growth, was put in place due to a toxic sales culture that pressured employees to open unauthorized accounts. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced that each of the bank's 215,000 employees would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around. The removal of the asset cap allows Wells Fargo to pursue growth in deposits, new accounts, and investment banking businesses.</p>

          <p>Pornhub is temporarily blocking access to its adult content in France to protest new regulations requiring porn sites to verify users are 18 or older. The company, along with RedTube and YouPorn, will display a statement on the new regulations instead of pornographic content. France's new standard requires explicit websites to verify a user's age using a credit card or government-issued ID, using an external site for age verification to protect user identities. Aylo, Pornhub's parent company, argues that age verification should be done on devices rather than websites, calling the government's measure potentially privacy infringing and ineffective.</p>

The UK government said it is "committed to protecting British business and jobs" and will continue to work with the US to implement the agreement. However, Trump indicated that the US might increase the tariff on the UK on or after July 9, 2025, if it determines that the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the EPD.</p>
