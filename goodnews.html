          <p>Following trade talks in London, US President Donald Trump announced a deal with China to maintain a fragile truce established after earlier talks in Geneva. The agreement is expected to cover various points of contention, including shipments of rare earth minerals, student visas, and tariffs. While Trump declared the accord "done," China has been more reserved, stating that representatives will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. The specifics of the deal remain somewhat vague, but if finalized, it could ease trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Facing U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductors, China is investing heavily in domestic alternatives for artificial intelligence development, particularly in chip design and manufacturing. While Nvidia remains the industry leader, Chinese firms like Huawei's HiSilicon are making strides, though they still lag behind. China's ability to produce advanced chips is hampered by restrictions on key manufacturing equipment, particularly from the Netherlands' ASML. Despite these challenges, China is pursuing alternative technologies and lithography techniques to foster innovation in its AI chip ecosystem. </p>

This decision, ordered by newly elected President Lee Jae-myung, aims to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace. In response, North Korea appears to have halted its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South, though it is unclear if this cessation is official. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed after North Korea launched trash-filled balloons toward the South.</p>
