          <p>This article explores the intricacies of in-law relationships, noting they often occupy a strange middle ground between family and acquaintance. It delves into historical perspectives, highlighting how in-law dynamics have evolved from strategic alliances to potentially fraught connections. The piece emphasizes the importance of open communication with one's partner about expectations and boundaries, suggesting that couples discuss holiday plans, potential conflicts, and the level of involvement each set of parents will have, especially when children are involved. Ultimately, maintaining a cordial relationship based on mutual respect is often beneficial for both the couple and their families. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO is pushing for member states to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, though some countries are hesitant to meet this target. Secretary General Mark Rutte is trying to reassure allies of the U.S.' commitment to NATO despite past frustrations from President Trump regarding defense contributions. Some member states, like Spain and Belgium, are seeking flexibility on the spending target and timeline, while others, particularly those closer to Russia, already exceed the 2% goal. Despite potential disagreements, leaders are striving for unity given the perceived threat from Russia and the current international security situation.</p>

          <p>This article discusses geneticist Marlena Fejzo's research into hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of pregnancy nausea, which led to a significant scientific breakthrough. Fejzo, who experienced the condition herself, found very little scientific literature explaining why some pregnant people get sicker than others. Through a DIY inquiry involving online surveys, she gathered clues that the mechanism at play might be genetic. Her work eventually led to identifying a biological cause and potential cures for pregnancy nausea, offering hope for those who suffer from this debilitating condition.</p>

          <p>A Defense Intelligence Agency assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by months, although some enriched uranium was moved before the strikes. The assessment notes that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, with the resumption of the enrichment program dependent on clearing the entrances and repairing electrical and water supplies. While President Trump claimed the facilities were "completely and totally obliterated," the assessment suggests the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. This early assessment, based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, could change as more information becomes available.</p>

          <p>A German court has fined the German Football Association (DFB) ‚Ç¨130,000 for misconduct related to the 2006 World Cup. The case involved allegations of tax evasion linked to a ‚Ç¨6.7 million payment from the DFB to FIFA, ostensibly for a World Cup gala that never occurred. Investigations suggested the payment was a return of a loan via FIFA from former Adidas chief Robert Louis-Dreyfus, potentially used to buy votes for Germany's bid to host the tournament. The scandal has tarnished the legacy of the 2006 World Cup, which is popularly known in Germany as the "summer fairy tale."</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist, declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded earlier in the evening. With 44% of the first-choice votes, Mamdani led Cuomo, who had 36%, but no candidate reached the 50% threshold needed to win outright. Cuomo's campaign indicated he might consider an independent run in the general election, while Mamdani celebrated his win as a victory for New Yorkers seeking an affordable city. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with comprehensive results expected on July 1.</p>

          <p>The Club World Cup is highlighting the challenges of playing soccer in the U.S. summer heat, raising concerns for the 2026 World Cup, which the U.S. will co-host. While European teams may struggle with the temperatures, historical data from past tournaments in the U.S. doesn't definitively show that they are doomed to fail. Scheduling games for European viewers often means midday kick-offs in the U.S., exposing players to extreme heat, though attendance and scoring don't appear to be significantly hindered. Organizers can improve scheduling to mitigate the heat, but elite players are generally able to endure harsh conditions.</p>

While the results are promising, the study's lead author cautions that they should be interpreted with scientific rigor, as the findings need to be confirmed in human clinical trials.

          <p>This article explores why the recent conflict in the Middle East has not led to a significant oil crisis, despite initial price spikes. Several factors have contributed to this resilience, including Iran's decision not to target oil supplies, traders' skepticism towards geopolitical spikes, the approach of autumn (a lower demand season), an oversupplied oil market, and the U.S.'s dominant position as an oil producer. The shale revolution in the U.S. has lessened the world's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, reducing the potential for a crisis.</p>

Heat exhaustion, characterized by headache, heavy sweating, and fatigue, can be managed by moving to a cool place, drinking water, and applying cold cloths. Heat stroke, a more severe condition, requires immediate medical attention and involves impaired consciousness and a rapid rise in body temperature.

          <p>Axiom Space Mission 4 launched to the International Space Station (ISS) amid ongoing concerns about air leaks in a Russia-controlled module. While the steady leak had stopped, engineers are now concerned that a new leak may have formed on an interior wall, causing air from the rest of the station to rush into the damaged area. This raises the possibility of the entire station beginning to lose air. The article details the history of the leaks and the efforts to pinpoint the problem, as well as the composition of the Ax-4 crew and their mission objectives.</p>
