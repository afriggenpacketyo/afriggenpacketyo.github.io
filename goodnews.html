          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experience of Michelle Renee, a California bank manager who, along with her daughter and roommate, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to the victims to coerce Renee into stealing $360,000. The article details the subsequent investigation, arrests, and trials, where Renee was falsely implicated by one of the perpetrators, Lisa Ramirez. Despite overwhelming evidence of Renee's innocence, the defense attorneys attacked her character, bringing up her past as a stripper and financial difficulties, however, Butler recanted his story, admitting he and Michelle never had a relationship.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market is defying the national slump, with luxury units selling quickly as wealthy buyers seek value-preserving assets. One Central Park, a luxury development in the city's core Huangpu district, sold all 64 units for $556 million, marking the first residential project in China to surpass $1.5 billion in sales this year. New home prices in Shanghai rose in April and May, outpacing national averages, with premium projects like Lujiazui Taikoo Yuan Residences also selling out rapidly. This trend indicates a sustained strength in Shanghai's luxury home sales, even as the broader market faces challenges.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners' job stress and stress-related behaviors in their pets, such as whining and restlessness. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," highlights dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and behaviors, potentially leading to changes in care routines. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by consciously avoiding work-related thoughts while at home.</p>

The coilgun is capable of firing at 3,000 rounds per minute. The breakthrough involves eliminating capacitors and powering the gun directly with lithium batteries. This advancement, detailed in China's Journal of Gun Launch & Control, addresses the previous limitations of coilguns, which relied on capacitors for rapid energy discharge.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author, journalist, and activist, passed away at the age of 90. Her influential book, "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," challenged conventional views of sexual assault by framing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. The book contributed to significant legal reforms, including the abolition of the "corroborating witness rule" and the implementation of sexual assault shield laws. While celebrated for her contributions, Brownmiller also faced criticism for her feminist views and assertions about the role of men in perpetuating sexual assault.</p>
