          <p>Spotify announced that founder Daniel Ek is stepping down as CEO to become executive chairman, with Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström taking over as co-CEOs. This change formalizes existing operations, as Ek had already delegated much of the day-to-day management. Ek will now focus on Spotify's long-term vision, including global expansion and AI integration, while the company's shares experienced a slight decline following the announcement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the Trump administration, specifically Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. The 161-page decision condemned these actions as an unconstitutional suppression of free speech, intended to chill lawful protests on college campuses. The judge, William Young, also criticized former President Trump's perceived misunderstanding of free speech protections, asserting that the judiciary has consistently rebuffed such infringements.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, requiring developers of powerful AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini to publish safety reports. The law focuses on preventing 'catastrophic risks' such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks, defining them as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages. It mandates safety frameworks, incident reporting, and whistleblower protections, aiming to set a national precedent for AI regulation amidst ongoing debates about state versus federal oversight.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Zillow and Redfin, accusing them of illegally conspiring to reduce competition in the online multifamily rental listing market. The FTC alleges that Zillow paid Redfin $100 million to syndicate its listings and exit the multifamily advertising market for up to nine years, effectively making Redfin's sites identical to Zillow's. The lawsuit seeks to unwind this agreement and potentially require divestitures to restore competition, causing shares of both companies to fall.</p>

However, this article advises avoiding common pitfalls, such as ignoring true costs like origination fees and insurance premiums, which can run into thousands. Borrowers must also consider the impact on heirs, who would need to repay the loan, and avoid borrowing more than necessary to prevent faster equity erosion.
