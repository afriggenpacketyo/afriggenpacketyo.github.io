          <p>European defense company stocks experienced a significant rally following comments from U.S. President Donald Trump expressing strong support for Ukraine. In a notable shift, Trump stated that Ukraine could win back all its territory from Russia with European and NATO support, boosting investor confidence in the sector. Companies like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt saw their share prices increase by as much as 5%. The market gains occurred even as the broader pan-European Stoxx 600 index fell, partly due to comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about inflated asset prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered approximately £480 million lost to fraud over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including illegitimate Bounce Back Loans. The AI tool, developed by the Cabinet Office, cross-references data across departments to identify and prevent fraudulent activity before policies are even implemented. The UK now plans to license this technology to international partners, including the US and Australia, despite ongoing concerns from civil liberties groups about the government's use of AI.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," emphasizing that the two nations should be partners rather than rivals. The meeting, the first of its kind in six years, was seen as a crucial step toward stabilizing bilateral relations. Wang urged Washington to view China objectively and uphold its political commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, aimed to open a new window for engagement and find a sustainable way for the two global powers to coexist.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will no longer seek special and differential treatment in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, a significant move signaling its commitment to multilateralism and free trade. Premier Li Qiang made the declaration at the UN General Assembly, positioning China as a responsible major developing country. He stressed that globalization is an irreversible trend and that pursuing decoupling policies would only harm the global economy. This decision comes as the WTO's appellate body remains non-functional due to the U.S. blocking new appointments, a major challenge to the international trade system.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares surged after CEO Eddie Wu announced plans to increase the company's investment in artificial intelligence and expand its global cloud infrastructure. The tech giant will build upon its existing $53 billion, three-year AI initiative and is launching new data centers in Brazil, France, and the Netherlands, with more planned for 2026.

          <p>England rugby centre Megan Jones, a standout player at the current World Cup, has opened up about the personal tragedies that have shaped her career and fueled her performance.

She describes the rugby pitch as her "safe haven" and credits her recent stellar form to a new perspective gained from her profound loss.

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a monumental infrastructure initiative, committing approximately $850 billion towards a massive data center expansion in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. This plan is a direct response to the exponential growth in demand for AI services like ChatGPT and aims to build the necessary supercomputing facilities for future AI development. The project's scale, requiring electricity equivalent to powering over 13 million homes, has raised concerns about a potential investment bubble and highlights the energy bottleneck in the AI industry.

          <p>In his return to television, Jimmy Kimmel condemned what he called "anti-American" government threats against free speech, stemming from the controversy over his suspension by ABC. During an emotional monologue, Kimmel clarified that he never intended to mock the murder of activist Charlie Kirk but stood firm against pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC. He argued that a president celebrating people losing their jobs over jokes is dangerous and undermines fundamental American values. The episode's return was met with continued resistance from some local ABC affiliates, which refused to air the program.</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, thanks to a major river-widening and reinforcement project completed over 15 years ago. The infrastructure work, spearheaded by former mayor Geng Yanbo, was initially criticized as wasteful but is now credited with saving the city from the severe flooding that affected other parts of the region. Economists suggest that such proactive investments in climate resilience can not only protect cities but also stimulate local economies. The case is being highlighted as a key lesson in long-term urban planning and disaster prevention for other cities across China.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has stated that an escalator carrying President Donald Trump and the First Lady stopped abruptly due to a built-in safety mechanism, likely triggered accidentally by a videographer. The White House had raised concerns about a deliberate act, but a UN spokesperson explained that a videographer moving ahead of the couple may have inadvertently activated the safety function at the top of the escalator. The incident, along with a malfunctioning teleprompter, was used by Trump in his speech to criticize the UN's effectiveness. The UN also noted the teleprompter was operated by the White House.</p>

The new capital would be used to aggressively scale Tether's expansion into new business areas, including artificial intelligence, energy, and communications.
