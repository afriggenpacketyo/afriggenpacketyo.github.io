          <p>Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, has publicly supported late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following the suspension of his show by the Disney-owned ABC network. Eisner characterized the actions of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, who had threatened ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's comments, as "out-of-control intimidation." In his statement, Eisner strongly defended the principles of free speech and praised Kimmel's talent, questioning the leadership of corporations that appear to bow to such overt political pressure from government regulators.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased, with the 10-year note reaching a two-week high, a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Investors are weighing broader economic factors beyond the Fed's immediate policy, including signs of resilient economic growth and slightly higher inflation. This market behavior suggests that long-term debt investors are focused on the overall economic outlook and future government financing needs, rather than solely on the central bank's short-term lending rate adjustments.

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz strongly condemned FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's threats to revoke ABC's broadcast license over comments made by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. On his podcast, Cruz compared Carr's language to that of a "mafioso" and described the rhetoric as "dangerous as hell." While stating he was personally pleased that Kimmel faced consequences, Cruz warned that empowering the government to police media content based on political preference would ultimately harm conservatives and the principle of free speech in the long run.</p>

          <p>A new market analysis from Wolfe Research predicts significant growth in U.S. electricity demand over the next five years, largely driven by the immense power requirements of new artificial intelligence data centers. This forecast has strengthened the investment outlook for industrial companies like GE Vernova, which manufactures power-generating turbines, and Eaton, a producer of electrical grid equipment. The report highlights strong demand and favorable pricing dynamics for these firms as the nation moves to expand its energy infrastructure to support technological growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The reopening marks a major and celebrated milestone in the nearly $1 billion reconstruction effort, which has seen the 12th-century Gothic cathedral restored ahead of the promised five-year schedule.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" initiative, which establishes a new tax deduction for certain tipped workers. The guidance clarifies that the deduction, which is capped at $25,000 annually, applies to a specific list of 68 occupations and explicitly excludes automatic gratuities. Additionally, the rules state that workers in certain "specified service" fields, such as healthcare, legal, and financial services, will not be eligible for the tax break.</p>

          <p>Following another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, consumers have several potentially cheaper options for borrowing money in the current economic climate. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) currently offer some of the lowest available rates, followed closely by fixed-rate home equity loans, although both options require using one's home as collateral. While personal loan rates remain higher than they were in previous years, they are still a more affordable alternative to high-interest credit cards and do not require any collateral.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, arguing that a central theme across his body of work was the complex exploration of winning and its often hollow or corrupting nature. From sports films like "Downhill Racer" to political dramas such as "The Candidate," Redford consistently portrayed characters who discovered the Pyrrhic nature of their victories or the emptiness that followed success. The piece suggests that Redford's own experiences as both an athlete and a major star informed his deep-seated skepticism of a culture that is obsessed with winning above all else.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to adhere to basic court rules requiring a clear statement of claims.

However, the court has granted Trump's legal team a 28-day window to file an amended, properly structured complaint, leaving the door open for the lawsuit to proceed.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are puzzled by an unusual green glow emanating from the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, a recent visitor to our solar system. While many comets turn green when heated by the sun, this phenomenon is usually caused by the presence of dicarbon molecules, which have not been detected in significant amounts in this particular object. This anomaly suggests the comet may have a unique and previously unseen chemical composition, presenting a fascinating mystery for scientists to solve as it makes its closest approach to Earth in the coming months.</p>
