          <p>A restaurant owner who had lost movement in his left side after a stroke has experienced significant recovery thanks to a new medical technology called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved device, implanted near the vagus nerve, delivers gentle electrical pulses during physical therapy to enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself. For patient Tommy Fello, whose progress with traditional rehab had plateaued, the implant led to major improvements in arm and hand function within months. Neurosurgeons believe this technology represents a breakthrough for stroke recovery, offering new hope for patients who previously had limited options for regaining motor skills.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the concept of "wardrobe diplomacy" through Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House. After previously being criticized by President Trump for his casual, military-style attire, Zelenskyy opted for a more formal black blazer and collared shirt for their latest meeting. This sartorial shift is interpreted as a strategic move to convey seriousness and a focus on high-stakes diplomacy, moving beyond a purely wartime image. The article draws parallels to historical examples, like Winston Churchill's air-raid suit, to argue that a politician's clothing always sends a political message and can significantly influence the tone of crucial meetings.</p>

          <p>The latest season of "South Park" is receiving attention for its direct and unrestrained satire of the Trump administration, a move that stands out in the current media landscape. The show's creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, are targeting figures like President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with scathing parodies. This comes as the show's parent company, Paramount, has been under political scrutiny from the administration. Despite this, a new billion-dollar streaming deal for "South Park" suggests its commercial value allows it a level of creative freedom that other programs, like the recently canceled "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," may not have enjoyed.</p>

          <p>In the wake of increasingly destructive hurricanes like Ian, Floridians are re-evaluating how and where they live, leading to innovative approaches in community planning and home reconstruction. Some residents are moving to newly designed inland towns like Babcock Ranch, which is built with storm-proof features and survived a direct hit from Hurricane Ian with minimal damage. For those unable to relocate, city programs and non-profits are helping low-income homeowners rebuild their properties at higher elevations with hurricane-resistant materials. These efforts highlight a growing recognition that proactive mitigation is crucial for the state's future, despite declining federal support for such measures.</p>

          <p>Coventry City Football Club has announced the purchase of its home ground, the Coventry Building Society Arena, from Frasers Group. The club's owner, Doug King, hailed the acquisition as a "pivotal moment" that safeguards the team's future and allows for investment in facilities and fan experience. The move ends a long period of uncertainty for the club and its supporters, who have endured multiple stadium owners and ground-shares since leaving their previous home in 2005. This purchase provides the Championship club with long-term stability and is seen by fans as a monumental step toward returning to the Premier League.</p>

          <h2>A New Generation of Democratic Candidates is Challenging Long-Serving Incumbents</h2>

          <p>A wave of younger Democratic candidates is launching primary challenges against established, long-serving members of their own party, signaling a growing demand for generational change. Frustrated by what they see as an out-of-touch and complacent party establishment, these challengers argue that senior incumbents have failed to respond with sufficient urgency to the political climate under President Trump. They advocate for a new vision and more energetic approach to connect with voters, especially younger and more diverse demographics. While incumbents defend their records and experience, the rise of these insurgent campaigns reflects a broader identity crisis and debate over the future direction of the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>At the age of 75, Eddie Horne has received his high school diploma, fulfilling a lifelong goal decades after his education was cut short by severe abuse at the Dozier School for Boys. Horne was a student at the notoriously brutal Florida reform school in the 1960s and later dropped out to support his family, haunted by the trauma. He was able to complete his education through a compensation program established by the Florida legislature for victims of the Dozier and Okeechobee schools. After walking across the graduation stage, Horne expressed his happiness and hopes his story can inspire others to overcome major life setbacks.</p>

          <h2>Dermatologists Highlight Unique Benefits of Tinted Sunscreen for Skin Hyperpigmentation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-23 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent dermatological research indicates that tinted sunscreens offer protection that standard sunscreens do not, particularly against visible light. While most sunscreens block UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, they don't stop visible light, which can worsen hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions more common in people with darker skin. The key ingredient in tinted products, iron oxide, is effective at blocking this type of light. Experts recommend looking for sunscreens with iron oxide to help prevent dark spots, though they note that the industry still needs to develop a wider range of shades to match the diversity of skin tones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, with its north vent shooting lava fountains up to 100 feet high within its summit crater. The activity is contained and poses no threat to homes, offering a spectacular view for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that the episodic fountaining is part of an ongoing eruption that began in December, caused by magma building up in a lower chamber and being forced to the surface. For Native Hawaiians, the eruption is a significant cultural event, connecting them to ancient stories of the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>After a five-year legal challenge from residents, a street in central Berlin with a racist name will officially be renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse. The original name, Mohrenstrasse or "Moor Street," has long been criticized by civil society groups for its colonial and racist connotations. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanian-born scholar who in 1734 became the first person of African descent to earn a doctorate from a European university. This change is seen as a significant, though long-overdue, step in Germany's process of decolonization and confronting its past, placing Black history and resilience at the center of public memory.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open begins, Iga Swiatek is considered the favorite in the women's draw, having built momentum with recent titles after a challenging start to the season. Her main competition includes world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, who is seeking to overcome a series of near misses in major tournaments this year. In the men's game, the dominance of Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continues, with the two having contested the last two Grand Slam finals. While Novak Djokovic remains a top player, his age and recent lack of competition raise questions, opening the door for rising contenders like American Ben Shelton to make a significant impact.</p>

          <p>Speaking at the Edinburgh TV Festival, actress and comedian Tina Fey stated that she is not worried about artificial intelligence replacing comedy writers. The "Saturday Night Live" and "30 Rock" star asserted that while AI can perform other terrifying tasks like writing music, it has so far proven unable to be genuinely funny. During the event, Fey also shared anecdotes from her career, including her famous portrayal of Sarah Palin and a meeting with former UK Prime Minister David Cameron. She also discussed her latest show, "The Four Seasons," and expressed her admiration for British television classics like "Absolutely Fabulous."</p>
