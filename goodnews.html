          <p>Former New York Yankees center fielder Bernie Williams has offered his perspective on the team's current 2-0 deficit in the American League Division Series, recalling his own 2001 team's comeback from a similar situation. He advised the current players to maintain a short memory but also learn from their losses, emphasizing a focused, moment-by-moment approach to turn the series around. Williams also commented on the differences in managing styles between his era under Joe Torre and the modern, analytics-heavy approach used by current manager Aaron Boone.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated Bangladesh by four wickets to continue their winning start in the World Cup. Chasing a modest total of 179, England's batters struggled against spin and slumped to 103-6, facing a potential major upset. However, a composed and unbeaten innings of 79 from captain Heather Knight, along with a crucial partnership with Charlie Dean, guided the team to a tense victory in the 47th over, highlighting the team's resilience under pressure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed a compensation scheme that could see lenders pay out £8.2 billion to millions of consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance. The plan addresses discretionary commission arrangements between 2007 and 2024, which often resulted in drivers paying inflated interest rates. Under the proposal, the average payout is estimated to be around £700 per affected agreement, and lenders will be required to contact customers to review their cases for potential compensation.

          <p>Jordi Alba, the decorated Spanish left-back, has announced his retirement from professional football following the conclusion of Inter Miami's current MLS season. The decision comes as a surprise, as Alba had signed a contract extension with the club through 2027 just five months prior. Throughout his celebrated career with Barcelona and the Spanish national team, Alba won numerous major trophies, including the Champions League, and was widely regarded as one of the best attacking full-backs of his generation.</p>

          <p>The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) provides crucial protections for consumers dealing with third-party debt collectors. Under the law, collectors are prohibited from using harassment, abusive language, or deceptive tactics to collect a debt. Consumers have the right to demand written verification of the debt, and if a dispute is filed within 30 days, the collector must cease all collection efforts until they provide proof. Borrowers can also legally demand that a collector stop contacting them altogether.</p>

          <p>Two women from Graz, Austria, who were accidentally switched at birth in a hospital in 1990, have met for the first time at the age of 35.

After a public appeal, the other woman, Jessica Baumgartner, was identified through a similar discrepancy during her pregnancy. The two women have since connected and brought their respective families together.</p>
