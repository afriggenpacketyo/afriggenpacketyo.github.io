          <p>Alex Caruso joked about winning a 'real' NBA title with the Oklahoma City Thunder after their Game 7 victory over the Indiana Pacers, referencing the Lakers' 2020 bubble championship. Caruso, who also won a title with the Lakers, noted the Thunder's team was younger and less experienced, making the victory more challenging. He emphasized the team's ability to learn through success and praised Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's leadership. Caruso also had to teach his teammates how to properly celebrate with champagne after the win.</p>

The pact allows Canada to participate in the EU's defense fund and includes joint work on cyber, maritime, and space security.

This decline is often associated with convertible offerings due to potential dilution of existing shareholders' stakes.

Despite the recent dip, Super Micro shares are up nearly 40% year-to-date.</p>
