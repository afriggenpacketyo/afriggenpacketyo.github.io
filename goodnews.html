          <p>British heavyweight boxer Fabio Wardley is preparing for a significant match against undefeated Australian contender Justis Huni, while also anticipating the birth of his first child. Wardley, who will be fighting at the home of his beloved Ipswich Town Football Club, speaks candidly about the challenges and uncertainties of impending parenthood. At 19, Wardley was working in recruitment before dedicating himself to boxing, and a victory over Huni could move him closer to a world-title shot as early as 2026. Wardley's dedication and determination in his boxing career suggest he will approach fatherhood with the same mindset, ready to embrace the new journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a new radar technology that allows aircraft to track moving targets without emitting radar signals, maintaining radio silence. The innovation, called a ‚Äúspace-time decoupling two-channel clutter cancellation method,‚Äù was unveiled in China‚Äôs Journal of Radars and enables a silent Cessna aircraft to detect moving vehicles with clarity, even in cluttered environments. Traditional methods struggle to filter out reflections from land, sea, or buildings, but this new tech clears the screen of noise, allowing for the clear detection of moving targets. This development marks a significant advancement in bistatic airborne radar technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce regulations mandating that the "vast majority" of new build homes in England must be fitted with solar panels. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this move is "just common sense" and could save the typical household ¬£500 annually on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports the initiative but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the government's goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The new rules will be part of the Future Homes Standard, detailing broader plans for energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction, with the government aiming for near-universal solar panel adoption on new homes to meet its net-zero target by 2050. The new regulations are likely to reduce carbon emissions and energy bills.</p>

          <p>India's central bank has delivered a larger-than-expected cut to its benchmark policy rate, reducing it by 50 points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by softened inflation and slower-than-expected growth amid global uncertainty. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra stated that the Indian economy presents a picture of strength, stability, and opportunity, despite holding the full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. While the central bank revised its inflation outlook to 3.7% for the current financial year, it cautioned about weather-related uncertainties and evolving tariff concerns impacting global commodity prices. Given the substantial rate cut, the RBI will shift its monetary policy stance to "neutral" from "accommodative," carefully assessing incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>The government has announced a ban on "unfair" bonuses for senior executives at six water companies that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have been convicted of criminal offenses. The measures address growing public concern over sewage spills and rising bills, despite water companies paying out ¬£112m in rewards to executives over the past decade. The ban, backdated to April 2024, applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, with regulator Ofwat empowered to claw back bonuses or take enforcement action. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that profiting from pollution is over, though concerns remain about companies potentially raising base salaries to circumvent the ban.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector, driven by weak domestic demand and steep tariffs on exports to the U.S., is leading to a flood of cheap goods in global markets. This overproduction is rippling through Asia, raising concerns that local industries could be squeezed by low-cost Chinese imports. However, economists suggest that the influx of these affordable goods could alleviate inflationary pressures for consumers in inflation-hit economies. This situation may allow central banks to consider further rate cuts as they balance lowering living costs with reviving growth amid rising trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Workers with AI skills earn 56% more than those without, and industries most exposed to AI show higher productivity and revenue growth.
