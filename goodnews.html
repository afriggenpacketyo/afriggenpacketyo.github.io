          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:54:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Technology firm Oracle is part of a consortium that could enable TikTok's continued U.S. operations if a deal between the U.S. and China is finalized. The agreement's precise structure, including ByteDance's involvement and control over TikTok's algorithm, remains unclear, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss it soon. This development follows years of national security concerns over the app and a recent Supreme Court decision upholding a divestment law, which Trump has repeatedly delayed. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to route U.S. user data through its servers, indicating its long-standing potential as a suitor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's readiness to ban TikTok in the U.S. was the decisive factor in reaching a deal framework with China. Trump's clear message that national security would not be compromised for a deal shifted negotiations, despite commercial terms being largely agreed upon months prior. TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. operations or risk a shutdown, though an extension may be granted. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are slated to discuss finalizing the agreement soon.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has announced encouraging late-stage trial results for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilintide, as the pharmaceutical giant seeks a successor to its popular Wegovy drug. Early analysis showed the once-weekly injection led to an average weight reduction of 11.8% in patients after 68 weeks, significantly outperforming placebo. Cagrilintide, an amylin analogue, functions differently from existing GLP-1s by increasing satiety, and was described as well-tolerated with mild to moderate gastrointestinal side effects. This development is crucial as Novo Nordisk faces supply constraints and increased competition for its current blockbuster treatments.</p>

Despite the illness, Buckingham Palace confirmed she still plans to participate in President Trump's state visit to Windsor. The Duchess of Kent's funeral marks a historic moment as the first Catholic funeral for a modern-era Royal Family member, with a message from Pope Leo to be read. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, presiding over the service, remembered the Duchess as a 'very down to earth person' dedicated to charity work.</p>

          <p>A new 'Hillsborough Law' bill will compel public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters, a move welcomed by campaigners who feared its watering down. The Public Office (Accountability) Bill introduces a professional and legal 'duty of candour,' with criminal sanctions for breaches, and ensures legal funding for those affected by state-related incidents. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who had pledged the law, emphasized its importance in ending a 'culture of cover-ups' and learning from past tragedies like Grenfell Tower and the Post Office Horizon scandal. The legislation aims to prevent future injustices for thousands of people.</p>

          <h2>Smoke-Dried Human Remains in Asia May Be World's Oldest Known Mummies</h2>

          <p>Scientists have unearthed what are believed to be the world's oldest known mummies in southeastern Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years. Researchers discovered human remains with cuts and burn marks, suggesting bodies were smoke-dried over fires by hunter-gatherer communities. This practice, found across China, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian nations, allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with ancestors, bridging time and memory. The findings push back the timeline for mummification practices, previously attributed to the Chinchorro people 7,000 years ago, and offer significant insight into prehistoric funerary rituals.</p>

These glasses, featuring a small display and hand-gesture control via a neural wristband, build on Meta's partnership with EssilorLuxottica. Despite Reality Labs incurring nearly $70 billion in losses since 2020, investors are seeking progress in consumer hardware, viewing smart glasses as a more promising mass-market investment than VR headsets. The $800 Hypernova aims to bridge the gap between existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses and experimental AR glasses, leveraging AI integration as a potential new computing platform.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the legendary third boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, the 'Thrilla in Manila,' held on October 1, 1975. Remembered as one of history's greatest heavyweight contests, the fight was a brutal test of human endurance and the culmination of a deeply personal rivalry that began in friendship and curdled into enmity. Beyond the ring, the event was a complex spectacle staged in the Philippines under an autocratic regime, reflecting broader themes of postcolonialism, race, and the commercialization of sport. The article explores the fighters' backgrounds, their evolving relationship, and the fight's enduring cultural significance.</p>

          <p>A Kenyan High Court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national suspected in the murder of 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru over a decade ago. Wanjiru's body was found in a septic tank in 2012 after she reportedly partied with British soldiers. The ruling provides sufficient evidence for prosecutors to seek the suspect's extradition from the UK. This development is a significant step for Wanjiru's family, who have long sought justice, and for the ongoing international investigation into the case, which has garnered considerable public and media attention in Kenya.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked President Trump's attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a significant blow to his efforts to influence the central bank. The 2-1 ruling allows Cook to participate in the upcoming Fed policy meeting, where interest rate cuts are anticipated. Trump had cited mortgage fraud allegations, which Cook denied, claiming her removal was due to her monetary policy stance. This case underscores the Fed's independence from political interference, as no president has ever successfully removed a Fed governor, and the Trump administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>New figures reveal that the number of winter fuel payment recipients plummeted to 1.3 million last year following controversial government cuts that means-tested the benefit. Previously, around 11 million pensioners in England, Wales, and Scotland received the payment to help with energy bills. However, a U-turn by the Chancellor in June means the vast majority of pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will again be eligible for the payment this coming winter. The policy reversal aims to alleviate widespread anger and a political backlash over the initial cuts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have definitively identified the vibrant blue in Jackson Pollock's 'Number 1A, 1948' as manganese blue, a synthetic pigment. Using laser scattering to analyze paint scrapings, researchers confirmed this is the first documented use of this specific blue by Pollock. The analysis, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides a unique chemical fingerprint for the color, which was phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This discovery offers new insights into Pollock's materials and methods, aiding in art conservation and authentication efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK state pension is projected to rise by 4.7% next April, potentially adding over £500 annually for new pensioners, according to the latest wage data. This increase is determined by the 'triple lock' policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics reported total pay growth at 4.7% for the three months to July, making it the likely figure for the increase. Concerns remain about more pensioners being drawn into the income tax net due to frozen personal allowances.</p>

Chinese firms are also holding out hope for Washington's approval of Nvidia's more powerful B30A GPU.

Furthermore, these numbers form a Pythagorean triple (3²+4²=5²), directly illustrating the famous Pythagorean Theorem. This mathematical elegance offers a source of comfort and beauty in a chaotic world, reminding us that hidden patterns exist everywhere.

Experts emphasize that the relationship with one's doctor is paramount, suggesting that telehealth is most beneficial when used as a supplement to existing primary care.
