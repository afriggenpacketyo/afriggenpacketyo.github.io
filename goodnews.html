          <p>At his party's autumn conference, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey declared that his party has a moral obligation to defeat Nigel Farage and the Reform UK party. He argued that as voters lose faith in both the Conservative and Labour parties, the Liberal Democrats can offer a compelling alternative rooted in British values, contrasting it with what he termed Farage's desire for a UK modeled on "Trump's America." Acknowledging Reform's rise in opinion polls, Davey emphasized the need to challenge Farage on issues like immigration and the cost of living to win over disillusioned voters.</p>

          <p>T-Mobile announced its largest sales week ever for the iPhone, providing strong evidence of high demand for Apple's latest models and boosting the tech giant's stock. The carrier's outgoing CEO, Mike Sievert, noted that sales were up by double digits compared to the previous year's record, with a high percentage of customers choosing the more expensive Pro models. This positive sales data, coupled with a raised price target from Wedbush analysts, has reinforced an optimistic outlook for Apple's current upgrade cycle, helping its stock recover from earlier year losses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As part of the proposed deal to continue its U.S. operations, TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained exclusively using American user data. A new joint venture, involving U.S. investors and overseen by tech company Oracle, will manage the app's functions to satisfy national security requirements. This structure means Oracle will audit the source code and recommendation system, effectively rebuilding it to operate independently from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The White House has indicated its approval of this framework, which aims to resolve longstanding data security concerns.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a strong case for significantly lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. He argued that current monetary policy is overly restrictive and risks harming employment, suggesting the rate should be nearly two percentage points lower. Miran cited factors such as changes in tax and immigration policy, easing rent inflation, and tariff revenue as creating an economic environment that supports aggressive cuts. His stance places him in dissent with the majority of his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee. (not investment advice)</p>

This new entity will have a majority of U.S. investors and board members, with software company Oracle acting as the security provider to monitor the platform and its algorithm. A senior official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, which addresses national security concerns by bringing the app's powerful algorithm under U.S. control.

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a prominent British-Egyptian activist and a key figure in the 2011 uprising who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel-Fattah's detention had drawn widespread international condemnation, with both the United Nations and the British government calling for his release. The pardon, which also included five other prisoners, came shortly after a Cairo court removed him from the country's terrorism list. His release marks a significant development in a case that became a symbol of political imprisonment in Egypt.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a nearly three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction provides significant savings for borrowers, particularly those with large loans. For a $1 million mortgage, the current rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the 7.04% average rate seen in January. This shift not only improves affordability for new homebuyers but also presents a favorable opportunity for existing homeowners to refinance their mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

This new caution at the top level of football contrasts with league leaders Liverpool, who continue to play a more attacking game.
