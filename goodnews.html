          <p>Circle's stock experienced a surge after the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish clear regulatory guidelines for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to other assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill now moves to the House of Representatives, and the stock has already seen a substantial increase this week. Stablecoins are gaining traction due to their potential to expedite and reduce the cost of payments, attracting interest from major corporations like Amazon and Walmart. The GENIUS Act aims to regulate the issuance, reserves, and compliance of stablecoins, potentially boosting investor confidence in the crypto market. The market's response reflects optimism about the future of stablecoins and their integration into mainstream finance (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that President Trump can maintain control of National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles, overturning a lower court's decision. The court found that Trump was within his rights to order the troops into service to "protect federal personnel... [and] property." Trump deployed the troops in response to protests against his immigration policies, while local officials viewed it as an unnecessary provocation. The ruling allows for the continued deployment of approximately 4,000 troops to Los Angeles.</p>
