          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major long-term contract worth $16.5 billion to supply semiconductors, boosting its stock price by over 2%. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is with an undisclosed counterparty who requested anonymity to protect trade secrets. This significant contract comes as Samsung's foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, has been facing weak orders and struggling to compete in the high-demand market for advanced AI memory chips. The company advised investors to be cautious due to the confidential nature of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspect dropped a bag on the sidewalk, prompting a response from the Metropolitan Police Department’s Explosive Ordnance Disposal Team, which cleared the item as safe. The individual was transported to a hospital for a medical evaluation and will face charges for unlawful entry and a separate fugitive from justice warrant.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has announced the success of "Operation Grayskull," an investigation that dismantled four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material. The network had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files, with at least 18 individuals convicted for their roles in leading and using the platforms. One of the key figures, labeled a significant global purveyor of this material, was sentenced to life in prison, marking a major victory for law enforcement in combating sophisticated online child exploitation rings and protecting victims.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen have implemented new rules mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that individuals and institutions should not be punished or have their evaluations negatively affected if a project fails due to reasonable circumstances, such as technical difficulties or market changes, provided there was no misconduct. This move is designed to encourage bold exploration in science and technology by reducing the fear of failure, fostering an environment where researchers can pursue high-risk, high-reward projects.</p>

          <p>European leaders have expressed cautious approval of the new trade deal with the United States, which sets a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods, averting a threatened 30% rate. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the agreement for preserving Germany's economic interests, particularly in the hard-hit automotive industry. Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof noted that while zero tariffs would have been preferable, the deal provides much-needed clarity and market stability for businesses. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the compromise, stating the tariff level on cars was the best outcome achievable.</p>

          <p>Five Eastern Caribbean nations—Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Kitts and Nevis, and St Lucia—are seeing a surge in interest for their citizenship by investment (CBI) programs, which offer a passport with the purchase of real estate. Wealthy buyers, particularly from the United States, are increasingly seeking these passports as an "insurance policy" against political and social volatility at home, with some real estate agents reporting that 70% of their buyers now want citizenship. While the programs are a vital source of revenue for the island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over security concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a significant trade deal, ending months of tense negotiations and heading off a potential trade war. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods imported to the US, half the rate Trump had threatened, while a 50% tariff on steel remains. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions in the US, including major purchases of American energy and military equipment. The agreement brings stability to the massive transatlantic trade relationship, though the new tariff rate is higher than pre-Trump levels.</p>

          <p>The ancient archeological site of Keeladi in Tamil Nadu, India, has become a center of political and historical debate. Excavations have uncovered a 2,500-year-old urban settlement, with some artifacts dating to 580 BCE, which some experts claim challenges the traditional narrative of northern India being the sole cradle of early subcontinent civilization. The findings, particularly Tamil Brahmi script that may predate the northern Ashokan script, have fueled regional pride and intensified the north-south cultural divide. The controversy has been heightened by accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress the findings.</p>

          <p>An investigation led by an Italian photographer and an Argentine journalist successfully tracked down a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights" in the 1970s. During these flights, political prisoners were drugged and thrown alive into the Atlantic Ocean. By finding the plane in the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs, the investigators uncovered documented proof of these atrocities, linking specific flights to the disappearance of a group of activists and nuns. This evidence was crucial in a landmark 2017 trial that convicted dozens of officials for crimes against humanity.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory over teammate Lando Norris at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the fine margins in their championship battle. Piastri secured the win by making a brave move through Eau Rouge on the first lap to take the lead, a strategic advantage at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit. While Norris was on more durable hard tires, Piastri skillfully managed his medium-compound tires to the finish. The race analysis suggests that a few small errors from Norris, including a suboptimal restart and minor mistakes during his chase, may have cost him a chance to challenge for the lead in the final laps.</p>

          <p>Despite Honeywell reporting positive earnings and raising its future guidance, the company's stock experienced a significant drop, a trend that has frustrated some market observers this earnings season. An analyst suggests the decline could be due to factors like the complexity of its upcoming three-way split, a lack of direct data center exposure, or general market impatience. The analyst argues that the negative reaction is overblown and that the company's fundamentals in aerospace, automation, and advanced materials remain strong, presenting a potential buying opportunity.
