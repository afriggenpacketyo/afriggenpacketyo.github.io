          <p>Tyler Glasnow pitched a stellar game for the Dodgers, carrying a no-hitter into the sixth inning and a shutout into the seventh, but ultimately suffered a 6-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks due to a lack of offensive support. Despite Glasnow's strong performance, the Dodgers' offense struggled, going 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and leaving eight runners on base. The loss shrinks the Dodgers' lead in the National League West to just one game as the Padres beat the Twins. Glasnow's ERA is low, but he has not gotten the wins to show for it.</p>

          <p>Justin Sun, founder of Tron, envisions a future where Tron's transaction volume surpasses Swift's within five years, estimating Tron's 2025 transaction volume at US$8 trillion. He highlights Tron's ability to facilitate transactions in seconds, contrasting it with Swift's slower processing times. Sun's ambition reflects the increasing prominence of the Tron blockchain in global stablecoin transactions, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the US dollar. He anticipates Tron's transaction volume could surge to US$300-400 trillion, potentially exceeding Swift's volume by 10 to 100 times.</p>

Xavier Williams rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown in the game. Quarterback Mark Gronowski, in his debut, threw for a touchdown and ran for another. Iowa's offense dominated, outgaining Albany 310-43 on the ground, though Gronowski struggled with passing. The milestone was downplayed in the post-game celebration, with Ferentz emphasizing the importance of the win itself.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is experiencing internal anxiety over the upcoming leadership transition as Eric Chu Li-luan prepares to step down as chairman in October. Despite a rise in favorability ratings to 36.3%, surpassing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at 33.1%, the party is not celebrating due to the volatile political landscape. Discontent with the DPP has surged to 56.8%, marking the highest recorded for any major party, while the smaller opposition Taiwan People's Party holds a 34.2% favorability rating. The KMT faces a critical juncture in determining its future direction.</p>

          <p>Beer sales in Germany are declining, but non-alcoholic varieties are gaining popularity, with sales more than doubling since 2013. Overall beer sales have slumped by 6.3% in the first half of 2025, reaching their lowest level in over 30 years. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free beer at sporting events as a healthy alternative to energy drinks. While full-strength beer remains dominant, a shift towards health-consciousness is influencing consumption habits, with people increasingly opting for alcohol-free beverages in between alcoholic ones.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show called "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of "Love Island," "Married at First Sight," and "Survivor." Couples meet for five minutes before being matched by experts, have a fake wedding, and then must cope with being stranded on a remote tropical island. The show aims to discover if love can thrive in isolation by stripping away superficiality. It features slightly older contestants, averaging around 30, who are genuinely seeking a partner and offers a way to "cut through the rubbish of typical dating".</p>

          <p>Scientists in the UK are employing drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spruce bark beetle, which poses a significant threat to the UK's forests. The beetles have been spreading across Europe, killing millions of spruce trees. Drones survey forests for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs detect the beetles by scent. The team also uses models originally designed to track nuclear fallout to predict the beetle's spread, and as a result, the UK has eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in the east and south east.</p>

          <p>Pupils in England who missed school during the first week of September 2024 were more likely to have high absences during the rest of the school year. More than half of pupils who were partially absent in week one became "persistently absent". Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance at the start of the 2025 term. The Department for Education said data from the first week of the 2024-25 school year showed the start of term was "critical" for tackling persistent absence.</p>
