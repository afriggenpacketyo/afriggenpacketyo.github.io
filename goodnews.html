          <h2>UK Government Partners with Supermarkets to Promote Healthier Food Choices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:42:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a new initiative requiring supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to help customers make healthier food choices. Rather than imposing strict mandates, the plan encourages businesses to use strategies like promotions on healthy items, loyalty point incentives, or revised store layouts. The policy, part of a 10-year NHS plan, aims to tackle rising obesity rates, which cost the health service ¬£11 billion annually. Health Secretary Wes Streeting framed it as a collaborative approach, contrasting it with previous "nanny state" policies, though some critics still argue it oversteps government's role.</p>

          <p>Four individuals were safely rescued after their 61-foot sailboat caught fire approximately one mile off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. Bystanders in another boat quickly evacuated the passengers before first responders arrived. Video from the scene showed thick black smoke and flames engulfing the vessel, with one witness reporting sounds of explosions as the fire spread rapidly. No injuries were reported among the rescued individuals. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now investigating the cause of the blaze.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the "most appropriate" governing framework for his coalition following the crucial House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority in the upper house is a "must-attain" goal for his Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, Komeito, though he acknowledges it will be challenging. The election is seen as a public verdict on his minority government, which is grappling with inflation and economic uncertainty. Ishiba remains non-committal on how he would take responsibility if the coalition fails to retain its majority, emphasizing his current focus is on winning the election. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the narrative that Gen Z is simply having less sex, arguing instead that they are leading a new sexual revolution defined by progressive politics and a rejection of traditional norms. While statistics show a decline in sexual intercourse compared to previous generations, this generation is also the most diverse in terms of gender identity and sexual orientation. The piece posits that for many young people, sex is an inherently political act, influenced by factors like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and a desire to dismantle old gendered expectations. They are redefining what sex means, moving beyond heteronormative definitions and focusing more on intention and exploration than on traditional milestones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has made significant concessions on its flagship welfare reform bill to avert a large-scale rebellion from its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concerns raised by over 120 MPs led to a stronger final package. Key changes include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a defeat for the Prime Minister.</p>

Another is EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust focused on experiential venues, which is seen as poised for growth as its cost of capital improves. Finally, oilfield services company Halliburton is highlighted for its strong international market presence and idiosyncratic growth opportunities that are expected to support strong free cash flow and shareholder returns.

An initial $10,000 investment would be worth nearly $3 million today. However, CEO Elon Musk now tells investors the company's future value lies not in cars, but in solving autonomous driving and developing humanoid robots.

          <p>This sports column advises Mark Walter, the new majority owner of the Lakers, to resist making immediate changes to the team's leadership. The author argues that both President of Basketball Operations Rob Pelinka and Head Coach JJ Redick should be given a chance to prove themselves under the new, more professionalized regime. While acknowledging that both were hired due to personal connections rather than traditional qualifications, the piece notes Pelinka's role in building a championship team and Redick's decent regular-season performance. The columnist suggests a "wait and see" approach, allowing the current leadership to operate within a new structure before making a final judgment.</p>
