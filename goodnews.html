          <p>Amid Beijing's rare earth export restrictions, the U.S. and Brazil are accelerating efforts to build their own critical metals industries. China's dominance in rare earth elements, crucial for various sectors including auto, electronics, and defense, has prompted concerns in Washington. Companies like USA Rare Earth are establishing magnet-making plants and developing separation technology to reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains. These efforts are aimed at securing a more diversified and resilient supply of these essential minerals, reducing economic and strategic vulnerabilities. The company is currently working on separation technology for its rare earth deposit in the neighboring state of Texas, again serving eager American clients.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Democratic Senator John Fetterman has publicly denounced the Los Angeles riots, labeling them as "anarchy and true chaos," drawing praise from conservatives who view him as a voice of reason within the Democratic Party. Fetterman's message on X, formerly known as Twitter, condemned the violence and destruction, contrasting with some Democrats' attempts to characterize the anti-ICE riots as peaceful protests. His stance has resonated with conservatives who feel that Democrats have been reluctant to strongly condemn the violence. This is not the first time Fetterman has broken with his party, having previously praised Trump's Middle East policies and denounced anti-Israel protests.</p>

          <p>A man was gored by a bison in Yellowstone National Park after approaching the animal too closely, sustaining minor injuries.

Park officials remind visitors to maintain a distance of at least 25 yards from large animals and 100 yards from bears and wolves. The article serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of wildlife encounters and the importance of respecting animals' space.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will restore the original Confederate names of several Army bases, reversing a renaming process ordered by Congress and completed under President Biden. However, the bases will be named after different service members with similar names, rather than the original Confederate figures. This decision is seen as a symbolic move to honor military tradition while avoiding explicit recognition of Confederate leaders. The move undoes efforts to remove Confederate symbols from military institutions.</p>
