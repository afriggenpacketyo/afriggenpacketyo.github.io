          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screenings at some U.S. airports. While an official list includes several airports like BWI and Philadelphia International, travelers at other major hubs like LAX and LaGuardia have also reported not needing to remove footwear. This change modifies a rule that has been in place nationwide since 2006, following the attempted "shoe bomber" incident in 2001. Passengers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt from this requirement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved an amendment to prevent landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." The new rule requires landlords to obtain a government agency order to vacate a unit for renovations, closing a loophole previously exploited by some to displace tenants and increase rents. The city is also developing permanent regulations that will mandate landlords to cover relocation costs or provide comparable temporary housing for displaced renters. This move aims to provide stronger protections for tenants while establishing a clear process for legitimate renovations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with online course provider Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership misled students. The lawsuit claimed a cybersecurity boot camp was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students. The university will also establish a faculty committee to oversee its other professional education programs, a move seen as a significant win for advocates pushing for more transparency in university-branded online courses.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine, stating they "have to be able to defend themselves" against intense Russian attacks. This statement comes just days after the White House confirmed it had paused some weapons shipments to Kyiv, citing a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The president's comments followed recent phone calls with both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. has provided billions in military aid to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began over three years ago.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct a large-scale reduction-in-force, which could have eliminated tens of thousands of jobs in August. The VA stated that staff reductions achieved through a federal hiring freeze, retirements, and normal attrition have made the mass layoffs unnecessary. The department is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees this fiscal year. Critics, however, argue the high attrition rate is not strategic and stems from a "toxic work environment," which could still negatively impact veterans' care and benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on order for 36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly driven by lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted the vulnerability of traditional platforms like helicopters to modern air defenses and inexpensive drones. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the country must invest in future-oriented capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The funds will likely be reallocated to programs for developing unmanned systems and one-way attack munitions, reflecting a significant shift in military procurement strategy.

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against the thousands of people who participated in the city's Pride parade, despite the event being officially banned. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's mayor declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to participants who faced potential fines. The situation highlights the ongoing conflict between Hungary's right-wing national government, which has passed anti-LGBTQ+ laws, and the more liberal municipal leadership in the capital.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is beginning a three-day state visit to the UK, which will emphasize the need for joint action on military threats, climate change, and illegal migration. King Charles III will host Macron at a state banquet at Windsor Castle, delivering a speech that highlights the shared history and culture between the two nations. The visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, is seen as a "soft power" opportunity to strengthen the UK-France partnership. A summit at Downing Street will address key issues, including support for Ukraine and a potential deal on migrant returns.</p>

          <p>Dr. Serhii Baksheiev is traveling through Ukraine's front-line and occupied territories in a mobile clinic, providing free gynecological care to women who have not seen a doctor since the war began.

Dr. Baksheiev's "Feminine Shuttle" is equipped to perform exams and minor surgeries, addressing a critical health need in devastated areas. Despite his own cancer diagnosis, he continues his mission, offering both medical treatment and emotional support to women impacted by the war.</p>

          <p>The public inquiry into the UK's Post Office scandal is set to publish the first part of its final report, focusing on the human impact and the adequacy of compensation for victims. Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system in one of the UK's largest miscarriages of justice. While this initial report will address redress for victims, the second part, which will assign blame for the scandal, is not expected until at least 2026, meaning the full path to accountability remains long for those affected.</p>
