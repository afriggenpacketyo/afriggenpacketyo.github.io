During remarks in the Oval Office, Zelenskyy thanked Trump for his personal efforts, while Trump expressed optimism about reaching a peace deal, stating it is "never the end of the road" for U.S. support. This meeting occurs in the context of a previous, tense encounter where Trump and Vice President JD Vance had accused Zelenskyy of not being sufficiently grateful for American assistance.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have officially named veteran Joe Flacco as their starting quarterback for the first week of the NFL season. The Super Bowl champion secured the position over rookie quarterbacks Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel, who had competed for the role during the preseason. Flacco, who is entering his 18th season, brings extensive experience in head coach Kevin Stefanski’s offensive system. Last season, he started six games for the Indianapolis Colts after an injury to their starting quarterback.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal brokered by Egypt and Qatar. The framework reportedly involves a two-stage, 60-day truce during which about half of the remaining Israeli hostages would be released, followed by negotiations for a permanent end to hostilities. However, Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, and his cabinet is expected to approve plans to expand military operations into Gaza City.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts advise seniors considering a reverse mortgage to carefully weigh their age, home equity, and long-term financial plans. Generally, older borrowers in their late 60s or early 70s can access a larger portion of their home's value, as lenders factor in a shorter life expectancy and thus less time for interest to accrue. However, it's crucial to evaluate immediate income needs against the goals of aging in place and potentially leaving the home as an inheritance for heirs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Many Over-the-Counter Birth Control Users Previously Used No Contraception</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that the availability of the first over-the-counter birth control pill, Opill, is expanding contraceptive access to underserved populations. A study published in JAMA Network Open found that nearly a third of individuals who obtained the pill had previously used no form of contraception at all. Furthermore, 41% switched from less effective methods like condoms. The findings suggest that removing the prescription barrier is effectively helping people who face the greatest obstacles to healthcare, such as being uninsured or living in rural areas.</p>

          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak that began in late January. The declaration comes after 42 consecutive days—double the disease's maximum incubation period—have passed without a newly reported case. The outbreak resulted in 762 confirmed cases, predominantly among children, and led to the deaths of two unvaccinated children. While the state-level outbreak is over, officials are urging continued vigilance as measles remains a threat in other parts of the country.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its widely used diabetes drug, Ozempic, for $499 per month to U.S. patients who pay in cash. This price is less than half of the medication's current monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The move aims to increase access for uninsured or underinsured patients and comes amid significant political pressure on drugmakers to lower prescription costs. This new pricing model is also intended to discourage patients from turning to potentially unsafe, unregulated compounded versions of the drug.</p>
