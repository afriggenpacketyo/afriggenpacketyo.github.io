          <h2>US-Japan Trade Deal Sparks Rally for German Automotive Stocks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 03:57:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major trade agreement between the United States and Japan has triggered a significant stock market rally for Germany's leading automakers. Shares for Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz all rose over 4%, with Porsche surging 7.4%, as investors grew optimistic about a potential tariff breakthrough for European exporters. The U.S.-Japan deal reduces tariffs on Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, raising hopes that the European Union might secure a similar agreement and avoid threatened tariff hikes from the Trump administration. This development provides a potential boost for the European auto industry, a significant exporter to the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists in China, including those from Peking University, are signaling that the nation's economy requires fundamental structural changes rather than just short-term stimulus to address its challenges. While deflationary pressures are a concern, experts argue they are symptomatic of deeper issues related to productivity and an over-reliance on investment. As Beijing prepares its '15th five-year plan,' the focus is shifting towards boosting 'total factor productivity' through technological innovation and significant institutional reform. This includes changing the incentive structures for local officials to prioritize high-quality development and consumption over sheer GDP growth and production capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced the finalization of a significant trade deal with Japan, which he described as potentially one of the largest ever made. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on Japanese exports to the U.S., a reduction from the previous 25% rate, particularly impacting the auto industry. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the new auto tariff level, which is seen as a relief for Japan's economy where auto exports are a critical sector. The deal is also reported to include a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate remained steady at 0.8% in June, holding at its lowest point in over four years and coming in slightly below economists' expectations. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also stayed unchanged at 0.6%. This persistent low inflation provides the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with flexibility to potentially ease its monetary policy to support economic growth amid global trade uncertainties. The MAS has noted that inflation has been lower than expected and projects core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a challenging retail environment in the UK, a chain of stores named Duck World, which sells only themed rubber ducks, is managing to stay afloat and expand. With four locations in prime London real estate, the business caters to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers with a flock of over 700 different duck designs. The co-founder acknowledges pressures from inflation and rising business costs but attributes their persistence to the iconic appeal of the rubber duck and the consumer trend of 'treatonomics,' where people buy small, affordable luxuries. Analysts note that while such collectible-based businesses can have high margins, they also face the risk of being a passing fad.</p>

This trend represents a cost-efficient marketing tactic for brands to engage with consumers at a time of sluggish spending. Analysts suggest the high profit margins on beverages and the relatively low operating costs of cafes make it an appealing model for building brand loyalty and encouraging longer store visits.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence suggesting a formidable prehistoric "terror bird" was killed by an even larger predator 13 million years ago. An analysis of a fossilized terror bird leg bone, found in Colombia's Tatacoa Desert, revealed distinct teeth marks that match those of an extinct, five-meter-long caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis. Terror birds were apex predators themselves, standing taller than humans with powerful beaks. This finding provides rare insight into the interactions within an ancient ecosystem, indicating that these fearsome birds were more vulnerable to predation than previously understood.</p>
