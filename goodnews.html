          <p>A Minnesota mechanic discovered a wallet that had been lost for 11 years inside the engine bay of a 2015 Ford Edge he was repairing. The wallet belonged to Richard Guilford, a retired autoworker who had lost it while working on the vehicle's assembly line in Michigan back in 2014. The mechanic, Chad Volk, tracked Guilford down via Facebook and mailed the wallet back to him. Inside, Guilford found $15 in cash and, remarkably, $250 in Cabela's gift cards which the store confirmed were still valid after more than a decade.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are reportedly developing a hypersonic drone carrier featuring an innovative "scissor wing" design, a concept once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft uses a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, while at hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome the traditional compromises between low-speed efficiency and high-speed drag, enabling versatile performance from takeoff to hypersonic cruise.</p>

          <p>Sarah Shaw, a New Zealand citizen legally residing in Washington, and her 6-year-old son have been released after being held in a Texas immigration facility for over three weeks. Their detention occurred when they re-entered the U.S. from Canada and a Customs and Border Protection officer discovered Shaw's travel permit had expired due to a paperwork error, though her work permit and son's documents were valid. Her attorney argued the detention was an unnecessary and inhumane response to a minor administrative mistake, highlighting that border officials had the discretion to grant her humanitarian parole instead.</p>

After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook the massive project of making it habitable, which involved cutting through 16 feet of rock for plumbing and using helicopters to transport materials. Now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, the historic fort that once protected against French naval attacks is back on the market as a unique private venue for £3 million.</p>

          <p>With food prices continuing to rise, parents across the UK are employing creative strategies to feed their children during the six-week school summer holidays. Some parents focus on buying reduced "yellow sticker" items, especially meat, to freeze for later use, while also finding ways to repurpose leftovers to minimize waste. Others meticulously plan meals for the week, bagging daily food portions and storing snacks out of reach to make them last longer. Many families are also relying on local food pantries and council-issued food vouchers to help offset the increased cost of providing extra meals at home.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, now preparing to receive their GCSE results, have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters were written just after returning to school from a lengthy COVID-19 lockdown and reflect their anxieties and hopes from that period. The students' writings captured their fears about the pandemic, their dreams for the future, and personal questions about growing up. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their journey through a secondary education uniquely disrupted by the global pandemic, highlighting their resilience and personal growth over the past four years.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, offering authentic, regionally diverse cuisine that moves far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition in their home market, brands specializing in fiery Hunanese dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using Singapore as a launchpad for international growth. These establishments aim to correct outdated perceptions of Chinese food by showcasing its sophistication and diversity through high-quality ingredients and immersive dining experiences. This culinary expansion is seen by some as a potent form of cultural diplomacy, or "ping-pong diplomacy," for modern China.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the music Elvis Presley recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975, a period considered his last major burst of creativity. The collection includes his final Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads like "Separate Ways," recorded during the collapse of his marriage. This era also saw Presley nearly cast in the remake of "A Star Is Born" opposite Barbra Streisand, a role that friends believe could have altered his career's trajectory before his death in 1977. The recordings showcase a mature artist grappling with personal turmoil, backed by his formidable live TCB Band.</p>
