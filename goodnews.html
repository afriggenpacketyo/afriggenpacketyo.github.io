          <p>Zhou Zhongpeng, a former Peking University doctoral student, has reportedly cracked Shinichi Mochizuki‚Äôs Inter-universal Teichmueller Theory (IUT), a complex mathematical framework that has baffled experts since 2012. Zhou's breakthrough, achieved while working as an algorithm engineer, could transform the ABC conjecture from a conceptual abstraction into a computationally usable tool. Professor Ivan Fesenko, a leading IUT authority, claims Zhou's results surpass Andrew Wiles‚Äô famed 1995 proof of Fermat‚Äôs Last Theorem in scope. This development revives Mochizuki's controversial theory and could have significant implications for number theory, marking a major achievement for Zhou.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political philosopher Erica Benner challenges the popular view of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, arguing that his famous work, *The Prince*, is actually a satirical critique of authoritarian power. Benner suggests Machiavelli was deeply republican, believing in shared power and representative government, as evidenced in his *Discourses on Livy*. She argues that Machiavelli sought to expose the ways of tyrants and believed in a human morality based on studying human nature rather than abstract ideals. Benner also claims that Machiavelli's insights into the dangers of inequality and partisanship remain relevant to contemporary politics.</p>

This response follows an incident where the Montgomery County Detention Center failed to honor an immigration detainer for an MS-13 member, an error acknowledged by the county's Department of Correction and Rehabilitation Director.

The proposal would expand the list of essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act to include prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. The costs would be paid by insurance companies, with premiums expected to increase by approximately $30 annually for those with private plans.</p>

This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. Robust domestic consumption and a lower dependence on exports have helped cushion India from the impact of U.S. trade policies. The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, but these were later reduced to allow for deal negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>
