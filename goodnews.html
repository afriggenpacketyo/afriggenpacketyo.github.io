        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical trial conducted by researchers at Saarland University in Germany has found that an over-the-counter nasal spray may significantly reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, showed that participants using an azelastine nasal spray three times daily had a 2.2% infection rate, compared to 6.7% in the placebo group. Researchers noted the spray, commonly used for hay fever, was associated with a lower rate of symptomatic infections and even rhinovirus infections. The findings suggest azelastine could serve as an accessible prophylactic measure, though larger trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness against various respiratory pathogens.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 Western allies have formally agreed to deploy troops to Ukraine immediately following a potential ceasefire agreement with Russia. This "reassurance force" would operate by land, sea, or air to enforce security guarantees for Kyiv once hostilities cease. The announcement followed a summit of 35 nations, though prospects for a ceasefire remain uncertain amid ongoing conflict and stalled negotiations between the warring countries. The United States is expected to finalize its support for the mission in the coming days, which President Trump has suggested could involve air support rather than ground troops.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding when to claim Social Security benefits is a critical financial decision for retirees, with significant implications for their monthly income. While benefits can be claimed as early as age 62, doing so results in a permanent reduction of about 30% compared to waiting until full retirement age, which is between 66 and 67. Conversely, delaying claims past full retirement age increases benefits by approximately 8% annually until age 70, maximizing the monthly payout. The optimal choice depends on individual circumstances, including immediate financial needs, health, and other retirement income sources, with financial experts suggesting strategies like creating income bridges to delay claiming.

          <p>Chelsea Football Club has reached an agreement to sign 20-year-old American forward Alyssa Thompson from Angel City in a club-record deal valued at just under £1 million. Thompson, a promising United States international, has completed her medical and is expected to sign a five-year contract with the Women's Super League club. The transfer fee surpasses Chelsea's previous record for signing defender Naomi Girma but falls short of the WSL record. Thompson's arrival will provide a crucial boost to Chelsea's attack, which has been weakened by recent injuries to key players ahead of their season opener against Manchester City.</p>

          <h2>Ford's Gas-Powered Expedition SUV Experiences Surge in Sales Amid EV Push</h2>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is seeing significant sales growth for its large, gas-powered Expedition SUV, even as the market shows increased interest in electric vehicles. The automaker reported a 53.7% year-over-year increase in Expedition sales for August, its best performance in 21 years, signaling strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. This trend provides a bright spot for Ford, whose profits have long been driven by large trucks and SUVs. While Ford's EV sales also grew, the success of the Expedition highlights a market segment that remains robust and suggests the company's strategy of not going all-in on EVs may be well-positioned.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated release of the video game "Hollow Knight: Silksong" led to widespread crashes on major digital storefronts, including Steam, as they struggled to handle the massive influx of buyers. Thousands of users reported being unable to purchase the game for hours after its launch, with outage-trackers showing a sharp spike in issues. Fans expressed frustration on social media, with many criticizing the lack of a pre-order option that could have mitigated the server overload. Despite the purchasing difficulties, the game's immense popularity was evident as Steam recorded over 100,000 concurrent players within 30 minutes of its release.</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy has announced he is stepping down as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, ending a 24-year tenure at the helm of the Premier League club. Levy's leadership saw the club move to a state-of-the-art new stadium and culminated in winning the Europa League last season, their first trophy in 17 years. However, his final season was marked by a difficult league campaign and significant fan protests criticizing his leadership. Peter Charrington, a director of the club's ownership group ENIC, will take on the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lindsey Stewart's new book, "The Conjuring of America," examines the deep-rooted influence of conjure, a spiritual practice developed by enslaved people, on mainstream American culture. The book argues that this tradition, primarily carried forward by Black women, has shaped everything from Southern cuisine and the blues to medicinal practices. Stewart traces how elements like eating black-eyed peas for New Year's luck and carrying good-luck charms originated in conjure rituals. Amid a resurgence of interest in these practices in popular culture, the book highlights the often-overlooked contributions of Black women to American history, framing their spiritual traditions as a source of healing, protection, and defiance.</p>

The industry appears resilient against broader economic concerns, with executives noting no slowdown in consumer spending or engagement.

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse received a stock rating downgrade from Evercore ISI due to concerns that rising beef prices could impact its financial performance next year.

He indicated a specific price point below which he would consider the stock an attractive purchase, should it continue to fall.

          <p>Jessie Lovette, a 78-year-old resident of Miami Gardens, has finally obtained her birth certificate after living her entire life without official proof of her birth. Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never received the document, which became a significant issue with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Her family undertook a lengthy legal process to prove her existence, which was reportedly expedited by local media coverage. With her new birth certificate, Lovette was able to immediately secure a Real ID and now plans to get a passport for international travel.</p>
