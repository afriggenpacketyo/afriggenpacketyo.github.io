          <p>Endurance athlete Lewis Pugh has become the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile journey in 12 days to raise awareness about shark conservation. Pugh aimed to challenge negative perceptions of sharks perpetuated by the film "Jaws," which was filmed in the area. Despite facing frigid waters and harsh weather, Pugh emphasized the urgent need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day. He hopes his swim will encourage people to view sharks differently and recognize their essential role in maintaining a healthy ocean ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand the impact of rocket noise on communities. With the increasing frequency of launches, scientists are examining sonic booms and other acoustic phenomena to determine acceptable noise levels and potential mitigation strategies. Researchers are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and are preparing for the even louder sounds expected from SpaceX's Starship. The goal is to gather data that can inform regulations and reduce disruptions caused by rocket noise.</p>
