          <h2>Darren Aronofsky's 'Caught Stealing' Explores Gritty 1998 New York</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 01:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's film "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player whose life unravels into a violent crime caper in a gritty 1998 New York City. Following a car accident and an unfortunate cat-sitting gig, Hank finds himself pursued by various criminal factions, including Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, alongside a skeptical NYPD detective. The article praises Aronofsky's evocative portrayal of the city's pre-millennial underbelly, coated in "graffiti, booze or bodily fluids," and Butler's compelling performance as a self-loathing protagonist grappling with squandered potential. The narrative masterfully blends menace and dark humor, offering an intimate yet unromanticized tour of a chaotic urban environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are currently experiencing a significant bull run, with one software engineer reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating an additional 20% through early next year. This robust optimism is largely fueled by government pledges to stabilize and boost the stock market amidst a shaky broader economy. The strategy aims to create a "wealth effect" that will, in turn, spur increased consumption across the nation, despite underlying economic challenges. Traders are strategically concentrating their equity exposure on high-beta stocks within the new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware sectors, anticipating further market stabilization and a strong comeback.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $950 million for Saturday night's drawing, making it the game's sixth-largest prize ever, with an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. This substantial increase follows no winning tickets being sold for the previous $850 million drawing on Wednesday. Powerball officials have noted a significant doubling in ticket sales over the past week, a trend that contributes to the ever-growing jackpot while also benefiting various community causes. The last jackpot winner was recorded on May 31, 2023, and the odds of securing the top prize remain a challenging 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading performance on Thursday as investors digested the Bank of Korea's policy decision to maintain its interest rate. While South Korea's Kospi saw a modest gain, other key regional indices, including Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300, experienced declines. The article also highlights significant corporate news, such as Australian miner Lynas Rare Earths' plan to raise A$750 million through a discounted share sale and Qantas's shares reaching a record high following robust full-year earnings. India's Nifty 50 opened lower due to the imposition of secondary US tariffs, and Asian chip stocks are under close scrutiny after Nvidia's recent earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to further assess housing prices in the capital and rising household debt, despite showing "modest improvement" in overall economic growth. The central bank upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and its GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, anticipating a "modest recovery" in domestic demand. However, it warned that exports are likely to slow due to the expanding impacts of US tariffs. This decision follows recent multibillion-dollar investment pledges from South Korean companies to the US as part of a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida is deploying an innovative strategy to combat invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades: 120 robot rabbits designed to lure and detect the destructive snakes. These solar-powered robotic decoys mimic real rabbits by emitting heat, scent, and natural movements, with integrated cameras alerting python hunters when a snake is nearby. This new approach aims to overcome the challenge of locating pythons, which are decimating native wildlife and have few natural enemies. Previous attempts using live rabbits proved too expensive. Officials express optimism about the early results of this costly yet promising detection method in controlling the rapidly reproducing python population.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an ace-like pitching performance for the Dodgers, leading them to a dominant 5-1 victory and a sweep over the Cincinnati Reds. In his first five-inning start since undergoing Tommy John surgery earlier this year, Ohtani threw 87 pitches, yielding just one run on two hits while striking out nine batters, showcasing a new, more unpredictable pitching strategy. This impressive outing was crucial for Ohtani, who had previously struggled to complete five innings, and is now pivotal in determining his role for the team's postseason pitching rotation. The Dodgers' bullpen effectively secured the win, further extending their lead in the National League West standings.</p>

          <p>USC has extended a multi-year offer to Notre Dame, expressing strong hope for a deal to continue their century-old football rivalry, following significant public outcry over its potential termination. USC Athletic Director Jennifer Cohen stated that a resolution is anticipated "very soon," despite previous reluctance from USC due to uncertainties surrounding the College Football Playoff format and the new demands of a Big Ten travel schedule. Notre Dame has consistently preferred a long-term extension, and while the game's date remains "the biggest issue" for USC, both institutions acknowledge the immense importance of preserving this historic college football tradition for fans and programs alike.</p>

The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is being sued by Emani Ellis for $24 million, alleging scratching and spitting. A receptionist testified seeing Ellis corner Cardi B and reaching for her, resulting in a cut to the receptionist's forehead, while the doctor corroborated that Ellis caused the injury and Cardi B did not strike her. Cardi B maintained she never touched Ellis, who she believed was filming her, and described herself as "very disabled" due to pregnancy at the time.</p>

The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million, which are expected to form part of the new REIT's initial asset composition.

          <p>All NATO member states are now projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant achievement largely driven by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and persistent demands from US President Donald Trump. However, a new report reveals that only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the alliance's new, higher goal of 3.5%. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized that "cash alone doesn't provide security," stressing the critical need to convert these funds into genuine military capabilities for effective deterrence.

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth projected to remain above 50%, signaling robust demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite this strong performance, the stock slipped in extended trading due to data center revenue falling slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company anticipates between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. While CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump, Nvidia still awaits US licenses to ship its custom H20 chip to China, which could add billions in sales if geopolitical conditions permit.
