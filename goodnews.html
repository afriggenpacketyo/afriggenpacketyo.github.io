          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez are hosting their wedding festivities in Venice, Italy, attracting a high-profile list of celebrity guests. Stars such as Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian were seen arriving for events ahead of the main ceremony. The influx of prominent figures has reportedly led to some local protests, with a "No Space for Bezos" campaign emerging amid broader European concerns about over-tourism. This will be the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S√°nchez, 55, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech company Xiaomi surged to a record high following an overwhelmingly positive response to its new electric vehicle, the YU7. The SUV, which is priced to be more affordable than Tesla's Model Y in China, secured over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. This success builds on the company's strategy of undercutting competitors, similar to its SU7 sedan launch last year. Alongside the vehicle, Xiaomi also unveiled new AI-connected glasses, signaling its continued expansion from consumer electronics into competitive new markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring its iconic "Blue Screen of Death" (BSOD), the error message that has signaled critical system failures on Windows for over four decades. The company will replace it with a black screen featuring a more streamlined and simplified error message. This change is part of a broader initiative to enhance the operating system's resilience and help users recover more quickly from unexpected restarts. The move was prompted in part by the major global IT outage in 2024 caused by a Crowdstrike software issue, which crashed millions of Windows systems worldwide.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Donald Trump may extend the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs, which is currently set to expire on July 9. A spokesperson stated that the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, depending on the progress of ongoing negotiations with key trading partners. The comments came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks. The 90-day pause affects country-specific tariffs imposed on about 60 trading partners, but does not impact the baseline 10% duty on global imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large, bright fireball streaked across the midday sky over the southeastern United States before exploding over Georgia, an event witnessed by observers in multiple states. According to NASA, the object was likely a meteor about three feet in diameter, weighing over a ton, and it detonated with the energy equivalent of 20 tons of TNT. The resulting pressure wave created sonic booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the event, which experts believe could be part of the rarely seen Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>A neighborhood in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is serving as an "urban laboratory" to test solutions against the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense development can make areas significantly hotter. The "cool block" initiative, led by the environmental group GreenRoots in partnership with the city, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing streets with heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white. These measures aim to cool a community that residents say can feel like a "Sahara desert" during summer heatwaves. The project could provide a valuable template for other cities looking to combat rising temperatures.</p>
