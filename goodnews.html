        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China, including defense ministers and leaders of the Rocket Force, casts doubt on the country's readiness to invade Taiwan by 2027. The dismissals, potentially linked to corruption or ideological differences, raise concerns about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. While China's military has advanced significantly, a lack of battlefield experience among officers and political interference could weaken its war appetite. The article suggests Taiwan and the United States should use this time to strengthen their defenses and avoid overreacting to China's threats. Optimism score: 60</p>
