This spending review is not a budget where taxes are changed or new policies are announced, but it has an impact on finances, jobs, and the cost of living.

This offer is available to players ranked in the top 750 who spend more than 10 weeks away from competition. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, shared that she has previously frozen her eggs and emphasized the importance of this rule in reducing pressure on players to return to the court prematurely.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising costs and market uncertainty impacting retirees, experts are weighing in on the safety of annuities as a retirement income solution. An annuity is a contract with an insurance company where an individual provides a lump sum or multiple payments in exchange for guaranteed income over a set term or for life. Fixed annuities are generally considered the safest option during market downturns, offering a set interest rate and payment term, while variable annuities carry more risk due to market exposure. Fixed indexed annuities offer a balance between the two, with potential for higher returns linked to a market index while preserving the principal. (not investment advice)</p>

The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady, cautious about additional cuts due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
