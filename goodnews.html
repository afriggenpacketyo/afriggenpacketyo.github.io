          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. government expects an equity stake in Intel in return for CHIPS Act funds, converting previously committed grants into non-voting equity under the Trump administration. This initiative aims to ensure domestic semiconductor production and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers, aligning with efforts to reshore U.S. manufacturing. Intel's shares rose following the news, despite the company's recent struggles in the AI chip market and a slowdown in its Ohio factory construction. The administration seeks to ensure taxpayer benefit from such investments, potentially pursuing similar arrangements with other CHIPS recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour will return to Donald Trump’s Blue Monster course at Trump National Doral in Miami in 2026 for the Miami Championship, ending a decade-long absence. The WGC-Cadillac Championship was moved from Doral in 2016 due to sponsorship issues, though it coincided with Trump’s political rise. This $20 million Signature Event marks Doral's 56th time hosting a Tour event and signifies a new era for the PGA Tour, expanding its roster of high-profile events. The return is part of the Tour's evolution and comes after Doral became a regular site for the LIV Golf series.</p>

          <p>This article details the potential interest earnings for a $150,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account across various terms, from three months to five years. It highlights CDs as an attractive option for high-net-worth savers due to their stable, guaranteed returns, especially as rates hover around 4%. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% could yield approximately $6,450, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could generate over $34,000. The article emphasizes the predictability and safety of CDs, making them valuable for financial planning despite not offering the high gains of riskier assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ rating on U.S. sovereign debt, anticipating that "meaningful" federal revenue from President Donald Trump's broad tariff policies will largely offset weaker revenue expected from his recently enacted tax-and-spending bill. The agency warned, however, that the rating could be lowered if high deficits increase due to political inability to contain spending or manage tax code changes. S&P also cautioned that political developments impacting U.S. institutions or Federal Reserve independence could jeopardize the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency.

          <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly changing the work of teachers, with advocates highlighting its potential as a helpful tool for both educators and students. Teachers like Jerome Ong are integrating AI into their weekly classroom routines, demonstrating its utility while also teaching students its limitations. Major tech companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic are investing $23 million to train hundreds of thousands of teachers on AI use, aiming to empower educators and streamline lesson planning. However, critics raise concerns about cheating and a potential decline in critical thinking skills, advocating for improved teacher support over tech alliances.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting their appeal as safe investments with returns often exceeding inflation. It notes that while national average rates are lower, online banks offer competitive rates, with short-term CDs (six months to one year) currently yielding higher returns due to an inverted yield curve. Strategies for securing good rates include looking at online banks and considering a "CD laddering" approach to balance high short-term rates with long-term savings. CDs offer predictability and FDIC/NCUA insurance, making them a secure savings option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has issued an emergency ban on "designer Xanax" (bromazolam), classifying it as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, in response to a growing number of overdose deaths. This action empowers law enforcement to make arrests for selling or possessing the drug. Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman is leading a coalition of 21 attorneys general urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to implement a similar emergency ban nationwide. Bromazolam, an unapproved synthetic drug, is highly potent and unpredictable, posing a significant public health threat when passed off as prescription pills.</p>
