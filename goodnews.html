          <p>A real estate agent with a decade of experience advises prospective homebuyers to use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit. This guideline suggests that the ideal house should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, like location or architectural style. Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, such as paint or countertops, while the final 10% are imperfections you can live with. This framework helps buyers move beyond an unrealistic search for the "perfect" house. (not investment advice)</p>

After a recent spike due to the Israel-Iran conflict, prices are expected to resume a slow decline, possibly dropping below $3 a gallon by September. This downward trend is attributed to factors like increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks.
