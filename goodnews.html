        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the "95% rule," a consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages that benefits heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule allows heirs to settle the loan by paying either the full balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This prevents them from owing more than the property is worth if the loan balance has grown larger than the home's value. The provision offers peace of mind for senior homeowners and a predictable, more manageable path for their families to retain the property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing allegations by an independent regulatory commission, nearly two years after the Football Association began its investigation. The four charges, which related to deliberately getting booked to influence betting markets, were found "not proven." However, Paqueta was found guilty on two lesser charges of failing to cooperate with the investigation, for which a sanction is pending. The verdict ends a period of intense uncertainty for the Brazilian player, who had faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty of the primary charges.</p>

          <p>The Brazilian government has reached a compromise in a trade dispute involving Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, granting it a temporary tariff exemption. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tax-free for six months in early 2026 as it ramps up its new factory in Bahia. However, Brazil also accelerated a planned tariff hike on EV kits to 35%, which will now take effect in January 2027. The decision balances BYD's request for relief against pressure from domestic automakers who warned that a broader exemption could jeopardize local jobs and investment.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect in a rainforest in Far North Queensland, which is believed to be the heaviest ever discovered in Australia. The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was found in the high canopies of a remote mountainous region, a habitat that likely contributed to it remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers believe its large body mass is an adaptation that helps it survive colder high-altitude conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) to an annuity is a wise move in the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility. While annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream and protect principal, which is appealing for risk-averse pre-retirees, they also come with fees and limited liquidity. The decision depends heavily on individual circumstances, including proximity to retirement, risk tolerance, and the need for a predictable income versus investment growth potential. It advises careful consideration and potentially consulting a financial advisor before making such a significant change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its decision to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that is vital for hurricane forecasting. The Navy had planned to end the data sharing as part of a modernization effort, but it changed course following feedback from government partners and scientists who feared the loss of data would lead to less accurate storm predictions. The information, which has been shared for over 40 years, is essential for monitoring storms as they form and for tracking sea ice in polar regions.

The deployment was highly contested by California's Democratic leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued the federal government, calling it an illegal "armed occupation." Newsom's office stated that Trump's "political theater backfired," as the withdrawal signals a de-escalation of the controversial federal presence in the city, with only a small contingent remaining to protect federal buildings.</p>
