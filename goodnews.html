          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay $511 million to settle a criminal case with the U.S. Department of Justice for conspiring to help American taxpayers hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The conspiracy, which occurred from 2010 through 2021, allowed wealthy clients to evade U.S. tax obligations. The DOJ stated that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States. The company pleaded guilty to conspiracy to aid in the preparation of false income tax returns and entered into a non-prosecution agreement related to U.S. accounts booked at Credit Suisse AG Singapore, which held over $2 billion in undeclared assets for U.S. persons.</p>

Commercial revenues grew 71% year-over-year to $255 million, while government segment sales jumped 45% to $373 million, with U.S. commercial revenues projected to exceed $1.178 billion this year.

          <p>President Trump announced that he is authorizing the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative to begin the process of imposing 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the U.S. Trump claims that incentives offered by other countries to filmmakers constitute a national security threat, asserting that Hollywood and other areas within the U.S.A. are being devastated. The announcement comes amid criticism of Trump's aggressive trade policies, and follows China's recent decision to reduce the number of U.S. films it imports.

          <p>The Social Security Administration is retreating from a recent policy change and will reduce overpayment clawbacks to 50% from 100%, following concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. The change comes after the agency started recovering erroneous overpayments by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments are due to problems with Social Security's own calculations. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, taking half of the monthly benefit will still be a burden to many workers with disabilities who receive SSDI.</p>
