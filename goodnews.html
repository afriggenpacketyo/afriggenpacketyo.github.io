          <p>European startup founders are resisting pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. Some venture capitalists have suggested that European startups need to embrace overwork to compete globally, but many founders disagree. They argue that Europe's most successful companies have achieved dominance through sustainable innovation cultures, not overwork. They also emphasize that Gen Z and millennials have less tolerance for toxic hustle cultures, and that startups need more funding and resources, not longer working hours.</p>

          <p>Retiring with a diverse portfolio of assets is crucial, but certain assets can be hidden liabilities that hinder financial security. Brand new cars, timeshares, lottery tickets, life insurance, whole life insurance, and high-interest debt are highlighted as potential money drains. Buying used cars, creating a travel fund instead of investing in timeshares, and avoiding high-interest debt can help secure a more financially stable retirement. Carefully evaluating assets and avoiding these pitfalls can improve retirement prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Chinese Officials Scramble to Comply with Xi's Austerity Measures</h2>

          <p>Chinese officials are working to comply with President Xi Jinping's austerity measures, ensuring their offices are modest and their spending is in order. Inspectors are carrying out checks to enforce the rules, which cover official events, buildings, and travel. The campaign aims to improve the Communist Party's image, stamp out corruption, and cut wasteful spending. Analysts suggest the campaign also serves to ensure resources are used wisely in China's rivalry with the United States and to identify loyal cadres for promotion.</p>
