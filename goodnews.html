          <p>In a rare public appearance at Lincoln Center, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the pointed language she used toward Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent majority opinion. The opinion, which banned the use of universal injunctions by lower courts, saw Barrett accuse Jackson of subscribing to an "imperial judiciary." Barrett stated that Jackson's dissent was made in strong terms that warranted a direct response, clarifying that her critique was aimed at ideas, not the person. She emphasized that despite their disagreements on judicial power, the justices maintain amicable professional relationships.</p>

          <p>A new labor market analysis reveals a sharp increase in demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills, with employers offering substantial pay premiums to attract such talent. Job postings mentioning at least one AI skill advertise salaries that are, on average, 28% higher than those without. The trend extends beyond the tech sector, with fields like marketing, public relations, and customer support showing significant growth in AI-related hiring. Experts suggest that basic AI literacy, including proficiency with tools like ChatGPT, is becoming a key differentiator for job seekers across a wide range of industries. (not investment advice)</p>

Zuckerberg is suing Meta, arguing the company has repeatedly and unfairly disabled his Facebook account for allegedly impersonating a celebrity. The lawyer claims his account has been shut down five times over eight years, costing him thousands of dollars in advertising revenue and business opportunities. Despite providing identification to prove he is not the famous CEO, the issue has persisted. Meta has since reinstated the lawyer's account, stating it was disabled in error and that the company is working to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.7 billion, an analysis shows how a winner's take-home amount can vary significantly based on state taxes. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, states like California, Florida, and Texas impose no additional state tax on lottery prizes. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout for a winner. The jackpot has now rolled over for 41 consecutive drawings, marking a new record for the longest streak without a grand prize winner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump held a dinner at the White House for prominent leaders in the technology industry, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and Microsoft's Bill Gates. The event was intended to foster closer ties between the administration and Silicon Valley, with discussions covering topics from business to vaccine technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk was invited but did not attend, sending a representative instead, following a public disagreement with the president earlier this year. The dinner is part of the administration's ongoing engagement with tech CEOs to encourage domestic investment and manufacturing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mostly higher following President Trump's executive order formalizing a lower tariff of 15% on Japanese auto imports. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant jump, and other regional indices like South Korea's Kospi also climbed. The move provided some clarity and relief to the auto sector, which had been facing uncertainty. Additionally, chip stocks in the region, including TSMC and SK Hynix, rose after Trump signaled potential tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms that do not shift production to the U.S., suggesting a potential benefit for existing Asia-based manufacturers with U.S. expansion plans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, predicts that enterprises will be hesitant to adopt agentic AI browsers within the next two years due to security concerns. He argues that unless these autonomous AI agents, which can perform tasks like booking flights, have robust controls for credentials and enterprise security, they will not be permitted in corporate environments. Arora highlighted the risk of credential theft, noting that his company's planned $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk is aimed at addressing this vulnerability. He believes the autonomy of agentic AI is currently at odds with the security needs of businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has upheld an injunction preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that restricts passport gender markers to only male or female based on biological sex at birth. The court ruled against the government's appeal, agreeing with a lower court that the policy likely reflects "unconstitutional animus toward transgender Americans." This decision allows transgender, nonbinary, and intersex individuals to continue obtaining passports that align with their gender identity while the legal case proceeds. The policy was part of a broader executive order signed by President Trump to recognize only biological genders.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering using the central bank-backed digital yuan (e-CNY) to resolve persistent payment defaults and clear complex chain debts. The proposed model would leverage the digital currency's traceability to ensure funds directly reach the end of a payment chain, increasing transparency in often-opaque commercial relationships. This initiative represents a novel application for the e-CNY, expanding its scope beyond the retail and consumer use cases that have been the focus since its 2019 launch. Analysts believe it could enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The London City Lionesses have agreed to a world-record £1.4 million transfer fee to sign French international midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain. This landmark deal for the Women's Super League newcomers surpasses the previous record and signals the significant financial investment from American owner Michele Kang. Geyoro, a highly-regarded player with extensive Champions League experience, is one of 16 permanent signings for the club this summer. The move demonstrates the ambitious goals of the Lionesses, the first WSL team with no affiliation to a men's club, as they aim to disrupt the league's established order.</p>

          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, yet some social stigma remains. While the reasons for getting tattooed have been consistent for millennia, their prevalence has surged, particularly among millennials. Researchers note that despite this cultural shift, negative assumptions can persist, and studies show people with tattoos may be less likely to be hired or trusted. However, tattoo artists and museum curators observe a growing appreciation for the medium as a legitimate art form, reflecting a broader societal move toward openness and individual expression.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is seeing positive results from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. At Lakeside High School in DeKalb County, students must keep their phones in their backpacks, a policy teachers say has created a better learning environment and increased engagement. The principal reports that since the program's implementation, disruptions have decreased significantly and student conduct has improved. This local initiative is part of a national trend, with over half of U.S. states now having laws that regulate or ban phone use in schools.</p>

The summit was intended to solidify European support and determine the level of commitment from the United States. This development is seen as a significant, concrete step toward ensuring Ukraine's long-term security after the conflict ends.</p>

          <p>Political scientist Sir John Curtice analyzes the rise of Reform UK, which has consistently led in polls for five months by capturing a significant portion of the Brexit voter base. The party's support is heavily concentrated among those who voted Leave in 2016 and hold socially conservative views on immigration, cultural issues, and climate change. This realignment has decimated the Conservative party's 2019 coalition, with half of Boris Johnson's voters now backing Nigel Farage. While Reform's success depends heavily on Farage's leadership and a fragmented political landscape, its strong niche appeal presents a credible path to becoming the UK's largest party.</p>
