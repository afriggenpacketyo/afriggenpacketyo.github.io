        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu next month to stimulate sales following a slow start to the year. The snack wraps, which were discontinued in 2016 due to kitchen efficiency issues, will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors. This decision is driven by sustained customer demand and aligns with McDonald's strategy to expand its chicken offerings, amidst the growing popularity of chicken-centric fast-food chains. The return of snack wraps could intensify competition in the fast-food chicken market, with Popeyes recently launching its own chicken wraps.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates a surprisingly positive shift in the labor market, with job openings increasing to 7.4 million in April, exceeding economists' forecasts. Hiring also saw a rise, while layoffs experienced a decrease, suggesting a relatively stable employment landscape. However, quits, a measure of worker confidence, showed a slight decline, and new orders for manufactured goods also fell, indicating potentially weakening demand. These figures suggest a mixed economic picture, with some sectors showing strength while others face challenges. (not investment advice)</p>
