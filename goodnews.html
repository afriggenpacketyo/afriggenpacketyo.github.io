          <p>This New York Times article discusses the revival of the reality TV show "Duck Dynasty" and its connection to contemporary American cultural politics. The show, which originally aired during the Obama era, focused on a Louisiana family who made their fortune through a duck-call business. The article argues that "Duck Dynasty" foreshadowed the rise of conservative identity politics, representing a traditionalist, Christian lifestyle absent from mainstream pop culture. The revival explores themes of generational change and the family's evolving relationship with fame, reflecting broader shifts in media and culture.</p>

          <p>Financial experts are urging college graduates to begin saving for retirement as early as possible to take advantage of compound interest. Despite potential budget constraints, establishing a routine of investing at a young age is key to long-term financial stability. Diversified index funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are recommended as low-cost options for building a long-term investment plan. Experts emphasize that "time in the market beats timing the market," encouraging new investors to ignore short-term market volatility and focus on long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his tariff policies against the critique that he always backs down from imposing them, a pattern dubbed the "TACO trade." He argued that his tariff threats are a negotiation tactic that has spurred trade talks with the European Union. Trump credited the threat of a 50% tariff on EU imports with jumpstarting trade discussions, despite initially delaying the levy. Stocks have reacted to these announcements, falling when tariffs are threatened and rallying when they are paused.</p>
