He praised Johnson's leadership and downplayed concerns about potential cuts within the legislation, asserting that they would not be "anything meaningful." The president's visit to Capitol Hill aimed to rally support for the bill, which is crucial for funding his domestic agenda, as it faces a critical vote amid Republican infighting.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has announced its commitment to maintaining steady prices, contrasting with Walmart's warning of potential price hikes due to tariffs. According to CBS News, Home Depot is collaborating with suppliers to keep prices consistent and shifting production away from China to avoid tariffs. CFO Richard McPhail stated that the company intends to maintain current pricing levels due to its scale and partnerships with suppliers. This decision comes after President Trump criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to tariffs. Home Depot aims to further reduce its reliance on China, with plans for no country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of its purchases within a year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has ignited debates about the stability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. According to a DW article, the blackout, believed to be one of Europe's worst, occurred shortly after renewables accounted for around 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some attribute the outage to an overreliance on renewables, experts suggest that grid stability issues are more to blame, pointing to the need for grid systems to adapt to the integration of renewable sources. The article highlights the importance of investing in technologies like synthetic inertia and better battery storage to improve grid stability and ensure a reliable power supply.</p>

          <p>Home Depot is maintaining its full-year sales forecast and does not plan to increase prices due to tariffs, according to CNBC. CFO Richard McPhail stated that the retailer intends to generally maintain current pricing levels due to its scale, partnerships with suppliers, and ongoing productivity efforts. More than half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and the company has been diversifying its import sources, including reducing purchases from China. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would have to raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot's comparable sales declined 0.3% in the fiscal first quarter, but improved as the quarter progressed.</p>

          <p>US buyer activity on Alibaba Group Holding‚Äôs wholesale marketplace saw a significant jump following a 90-day pause on new tariffs between Washington and Beijing. According to the South China Morning Post, inquiries from US-based buyers to sellers on Alibaba.com surged by over 40% in the week following the agreement. This spike indicates that US businesses are quickly capitalizing on the tariff reprieve by stockpiling goods to mitigate the impact of high tariffs imposed on Chinese goods. Some buyers are also securing inventory for the holiday season, with inquiries related to Christmas products climbing by more than 20% during the week.</p>

          <p>Venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence are driving much of the growth in the startup market, while companies in other areas are struggling to raise cash, according to a report from Silicon Valley Bank. According to CNBC, about 40% of the total amount raised by U.S. venture funds last year was from funds that list AI as a focus, up from 10% in 2021. Excluding AI investment, there is no meaningful uptick for other companies, with investment from this group essentially flat for the last year. The challenge for the broader market is that exit activity remains tight, and while investors were bullish on Trump's return, the aggressive tariff policy has led to delays in planned IPOs.</p>

However, the treaty's enforcement is unclear, and some experts express concerns over its limited legal power. The absence of the United States, which withdrew from the WHO, also poses a challenge, potentially limiting the treaty's effectiveness due to the U.S.'s significant role in global health and pharmaceutical research.</p>
