        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mainland China's US$12.7 trillion stock market is experiencing a robust rally, driven by a sustained shift of household savings into equities for a second consecutive month. Data from the People's Bank of China revealed a substantial 1.17 trillion yuan (US$164.3 billion) rise in deposits at non-banking financial institutions in August, following a 2.15 trillion yuan inflow in July. This trend, fueled by low-interest-rate policies, is pushing capital out of traditional banking deposits towards the capital market in search of better returns. Chinese stocks are increasingly attractive, with a 5.5% earnings yield for major listed companies, significantly higher than government bonds or demand deposit rates. This article details the ongoing financial rotation and its implications for market momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK and US are set to sign a landmark "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy" agreement, designed to significantly accelerate nuclear power development, create thousands of jobs, and bolster energy security. This deal, anticipated during President Donald Trump's state visit, aims to unlock billions in private investment by streamlining regulatory approvals, potentially halving the licensing period for nuclear projects to just two years. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has lauded the initiative as "building a golden age of nuclear," placing both nations at the forefront of global innovation. This article highlights the strategic collaboration's potential to reduce household energy bills, foster economic growth, and eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear material by 2028, signaling a major step towards clean, homegrown power.</p>

This article identifies five prominent candidates: Stripe, Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank, and Payhawk, detailing their current valuations and potential listing strategies. Many fintech unicorn CEOs are closely observing Klarna's market reception to determine the optimal timing for their own debuts, with the U.S. appearing to be a preferred location for some. The positive performance of recent fintech IPOs, including eToro and Gemini, suggests a more welcoming Wall Street environment for such listings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is actively exploring an ambitious initiative, known as C2N, to convert existing coal-fired power plants into advanced nuclear facilities, specifically utilizing fourth-generation reactors. This strategic move, proposed by China Energy Engineering Group Co., Ltd (CEEC), the nation’s top state-owned energy infrastructure builder, aims to directly decarbonize China's energy sector while efficiently preserving valuable existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal areas. With over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and approximately 100 gigawatts expected to reach retirement by 2030, this plan offers a pragmatic pathway to meet stringent site safety requirements and enhance public acceptance for nuclear power. This article highlights China's innovative and large-scale approach to transitioning towards cleaner energy sources.</p>
