          <p>Palm Beach County, Florida, has unanimously approved a resolution to rename a four-mile stretch of Southern Boulevard, leading to Mar-a-Lago, as 'PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP BOULEVARD.' President Trump praised the decision on Truth Social, thanking Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, and state lawmakers for the "wonderful honor." This ceremonial renaming, which will not affect postal addresses, follows legislation signed by Governor DeSantis directing the Florida Department of Transportation to erect a sign honoring Trump. Another section of the road will also be renamed to honor three fallen motorcycle deputies from the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham's new Netflix series, "Too Much," draws inspiration from her personal experiences of moving to London and confronting the city's reality compared to her romanticized expectations. Having grown up as an Anglophile influenced by classic literature and period dramas, Dunham initially found herself obsessed with pop culture like S Club 7 during a teenage visit. The 10-episode show, produced by Working Title, stars Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, and features numerous celebrity cameos. Dunham's narrative delves into the challenges of adjusting to social cues and linguistic differences, providing a fresh spin on the London romcom genre.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 00:00:08 EDT</div>

          <p>China has completed a monumental 1,856-kilometer "green belt" in Inner Mongolia, effectively trapping and controlling the expansion of three major deserts: Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh. This ambitious environmental project, often referred to as a "green great wall," employs a two-step method. First, straw checkerboards are strategically placed to stabilize shifting sands, preventing further encroachment. This is then followed by the planting of drought-resistant trees, such as sacsaoul, to establish a robust and effective sand prevention and control system. This initiative underscores China's significant long-term commitment to ecological restoration and combating desertification across its vast territories.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Super Micro, a key supplier of AI servers packed with Nvidia chips, plans to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including ramping up manufacturing in the region. CEO Charles Liang stated that growing demand in Europe necessitates this expansion, reinforcing the company's commitment to global AI infrastructure. Despite recent stock fluctuations due to accounting concerns, which have since been assuaged by financial filings, Liang dismissed fears about product demand, asserting the company's "tremendous" growth potential. This strategic move aligns with broader calls for Europe to boost its computing capacity, as highlighted by Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers phenom Jacob Misiorowski delivered an "unbelievable" performance against the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out 12 batters over six innings in a 3-1 victory that extended the Dodgers' losing streak to five games. Despite Shohei Ohtani's early leadoff home run, the Dodgers struggled to generate offense against the hard-throwing rookie, who frequently touched triple-digits with his fastball. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts acknowledged Misiorowski's "really good stuff," while veteran Clayton Kershaw, who pitched a solid game himself, praised the young pitcher's command and four-pitch mix. The Dodgers' inability to capitalize on scoring opportunities ultimately sealed their fifth consecutive loss.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against U.S. President Donald Trump's criticism of the BRICS bloc, Brazil and India have vowed to triple their trade flows. Trump recently claimed BRICS was established to harm the U.S. dollar and threatened a 10% tariff on any nation within the group. The BRICS group, which has expanded beyond its original four members, aims to unite emerging market economies and reform Western-dominated international institutions. While Trump continues to attack the bloc for "anti-American policies," the BRICS nations have not officially responded to his hardening posture, instead focusing on strengthening internal economic ties.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a hub for global public goods, filling a gap left by the United States' shifting foreign aid priorities. With USAID's independent agency status ending and the Trump administration's "America first" mentality, the US development sector is reportedly being dismantled, prioritizing domestic over overseas investments. In contrast, China is taking a more proactive role in international development, exemplified by the high-profile debut of the China-initiated International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. This shift in the center of gravity for global cooperation presents a new path for Hong Kong's prominence as a cosmopolitan city.</p>
