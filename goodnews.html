        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a ‚Ç¨1.35 billion capital raise led by the French state. This capital increase, along with debt refinancing, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights. Eutelsat uses rockets from companies like SpaceX to deploy satellites into LEO and geostationary orbit, and following a deal with OneWeb in 2023, became the world's third-largest satellite operator.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, has warned against the growing "addiction" to blind boxes and card packs among young people. The newspaper called for stricter identity verification to curb minors' "out-of-control consumption" of these items, which contain randomly chosen toys or cards. The allure of "unknown surprises" in these opaque packages can lead to impulsive spending and "commercial traps." This warning echoes regulations enacted to prevent online gaming addiction among teenagers, as the purchase of blind boxes carries an element of gambling due to the unpredictable rewards and rarity levels used to attract consumers.</p>

          <p>A sheriff in Skamania County, Washington, is considering implementing an ordinance to charge hikers who are reckless or negligent for their rescue costs, due to a surge in search-and-rescue missions. This comes after incidents such as a kayaker going over a waterfall and a woman suffering a head injury while sliding down Mt. St. Helens. The sheriff aims to deter risky behavior and recoup the financial burden on the county. Similar measures have been considered in other states, with some requiring permits for challenging canyons and others allowing reimbursement for rescues involving extraordinary methods and criminal convictions.</p>
