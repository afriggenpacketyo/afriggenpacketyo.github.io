        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has significantly altered its proposed welfare reforms following a major rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the initial rollout was mishandled and stated the concessions, which include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIP) to new claimants only, have put the government in a "better position" to pass the bill. The changes came after widespread concern that the original plans would harm disabled and vulnerable people. This episode has raised questions about the prime minister's ability to manage internal party dissent.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, will present a more relatable and vulnerable version of the iconic hero. Actor David Corenswet, who plays the Man of Steel, and Gunn explain that this Superman is not indestructible and experiences loneliness, seeking connection with humanity. The film, which has a budget of over $225 million, aims to differentiate itself from past portrayals by emphasizing the character's human struggles alongside his powers. This approach is intended to make the classic hero feel more rebellious and relevant in today's world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Forrest Galante, a wildlife biologist and "Shark Week" host, advises beachgoers to be educated about shark behavior rather than giving in to "hysteria" fueled by movies like 'Jaws'. He emphasizes that sharks do not intentionally hunt humans and that negative encounters are rare. To minimize risk, Galante suggests avoiding swimming at dawn and dusk, staying away from areas with high marine life activity like river mouths, and not wearing shiny jewelry that can mimic bait fish. He stresses that a few minutes of research about a beach destination can substantially reduce any potential danger.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not yet endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic socialist who won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor. While Jeffries praised Mamdani for running a "successful" campaign focused on the cost of living, he stated he is holding back an endorsement because they "don't really know each other well." Jeffries indicated that the next step is a substantive conversation to discuss Mamdani's vision for the city. This hesitation from a top Democrat highlights the internal party dynamics following the progressive candidate's upset victory.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for supermarkets and food manufacturers to voluntarily encourage customers to buy healthier food. Rather than imposing mandatory targets, the strategy involves partnering with the industry to promote healthy options through methods like loyalty point incentives, in-store promotions, or layout changes. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the goal is to tackle rising obesity rates and relieve pressure on the NHS. The move has been met with some criticism, with opponents describing it as a "nanny state" approach to public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist who studies couples suggests that answering "no" to four specific questions may indicate unacknowledged unhappiness in a relationship. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. The other two questions ask if a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. The article argues that these aspects are crucial for emotional intimacy, security, and healthy conflict resolution, which are the foundations of a fulfilling partnership.</p>

          <p>Despite narratives of a "sex recession," Gen Z is portrayed as leading a new sexual revolution by challenging traditional definitions of sex, gender, and relationships. The article argues that while this generation may be having less partnered sex than previous ones, they are more politically engaged with issues of sexual and reproductive freedom. Having grown up post-#MeToo and with the overturning of Roe v. Wade, many young people view sex and its control as inherently political. This has led to a more inclusive and fluid understanding of sexuality, particularly among LGBTQ+ youth who reject rigid concepts like virginity.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by Vanguard of nearly 5 million retirement plans shows a strong correlation between income and 401(k) savings balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report suggests that despite economic uncertainty, many Americans are consistently saving for retirement. It also highlights the effectiveness of plan design, noting that employees automatically enrolled in their plans have significantly higher balances than those who had to voluntarily opt-in.

          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the health company Evvy, reveals that a key trait she looks for when hiring is the ability to both strategize and execute. She finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and not in the hands-on work required to implement ideas. In a startup environment, Jain explains, there isn't the luxury of having separate teams for planning and doing, so every employee must be capable of both. To identify this trait, she asks candidates to describe in detail how they solved a past problem, looking for enthusiasm for the entire process.</p>
