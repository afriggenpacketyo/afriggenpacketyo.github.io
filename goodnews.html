          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, exceeding analyst expectations and signaling it is on track to meet its annual targets. The positive results came despite the strengthening euro impacting U.S. dollar-denominated business and mixed performance in its investment banking unit, where a decline in advisory revenue offset gains in fixed income and currencies. The bank's CFO noted sluggish corporate loan growth but expressed confidence in the firm's momentum, cost discipline, and the renewed stability in German politics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has been forced to withdraw from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia after experiencing concussion symptoms during training. This is the second time a head injury has sidelined him on the tour, with Huw Jones now starting in his place alongside Bundee Aki. Coach Andy Farrell and captain Maro Itoje praised Ringrose for his selflessness in reporting his symptoms, highlighting the importance of player honesty regarding head injuries. The team, featuring a record nine Irish players, is aiming to secure a historic back-to-back tour victory in Australia.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a pilot program providing monthly electronic coupons to seniors, a rare form of direct fiscal support aimed at alleviating the financial burden of elder care and stimulating consumption. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to those assessed as moderately to severely disabled and can be used for services like meal assistance and day care. Economists view this as a step toward strengthening the country's social safety net, which is crucial for unlocking domestic spending as China grapples with a rapidly aging population.

          <p>After a ten-year legal battle, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate overturned. The ruling raises significant questions about the prosecutions that followed the 2008 financial crisis, with seven other convicted traders now expected to appeal. Calls for a public inquiry are growing from senior politicians, who question the methods of the Serious Fraud Office and the pressure allegedly exerted by central banks. The decision also opens the possibility of compensation claims, though legal experts note the process is not straightforward.</p>

          <p>A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 2-1 decision affirms a lower court's nationwide injunction, preventing the administration from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The court agreed that the order's interpretation violates the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy and moves the contentious issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>In response to a severe national housing shortage, a growing number of states are passing laws to compel local governments to allow for more affordable and denser housing. Utah, for example, has strengthened its requirements for cities to create affordable options, using both incentives and penalties to overcome local "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) opposition. While developers and city planners in some areas are embracing the changes, many local officials are pushing back, citing concerns about infrastructure strain and loss of local control. The trend highlights the tension between state-level goals for economic accessibility and local community planning.</p>

A team of 25 researchers has set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific. The research aims to understand ocean evolution and sediment processes over the last 126,000 years. This collaboration is seen as a step toward addressing global climate challenges and may also support both countries' strategic ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>

          <p>The MLS All-Star game, which saw the MLS team defeat a Liga MX selection 3-1, served as an entertaining spectacle but also sparked debate about its relevance, underscored by Lionel Messi's decision to skip the event. While the game showcased top talent, Messi's absence suggests that for global stars, a mid-season exhibition is less important than crucial league matches. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the issue, admitting that while the event is commercially important, the league needs to reconsider its format to maintain player engagement and boost its modest broadcast viewership in an increasingly congested global soccer calendar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a substantially lower risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Researchers argue this is a more realistic and evidence-based target for many people than the popular but unscientific goal of 10,000 steps. The analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that the health benefits tended to level off beyond 7,000 steps for most conditions. This finding could encourage more people to use step tracking as a simple and effective way to improve their long-term health.</p>

These pelagic snails, distinguished by their vibrant purple shells, typically live in warmer subtropical waters and float on the ocean surface using a self-secreted bubble raft. Researchers noted the discovery coincided with unusually warm offshore water temperatures. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, scientists will be monitoring for more of these snails as a potential indicator of changing ocean conditions.</p>

After making his debut at first base, Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more engaged in the game and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This contrasts sharply with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he had been adamant about his desire to exclusively handle DH duties. Devers contributed two hits in his first game at the new position, a 9-0 victory for the Giants.</p>
