          <p>President Trump announced a planned partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it would create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This announcement follows the Biden administration's previous block of Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. While the terms of the deal remain unclear, investors reacted positively, with U.S. Steel shares jumping significantly. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern about the impact on American jobs, while Pennsylvania officials voiced support, emphasizing the deal's potential to strengthen the American steel industry.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's upcoming gubernatorial elections feature hotly contested primaries, with experts suggesting the race could indicate national sentiment ahead of the 2026 midterms. The Democratic primary has a crowded field, including Mikie Sherrill, Josh Gottheimer, and Ras Baraka, while Republicans hope to flip the governorship red, with Trump endorsing Jack Ciattarelli. Issues like immigration enforcement, housing costs, and affordability are central to the race. Experts say the election could be a bellwether for how voters feel about President Donald Trump and the upcoming midterms.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, stating U.S. Steel will remain in America and keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh. Nippon Steel's previous bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden, but this new arrangement has been subject to a national security review. The partnership is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% following the news.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline its rules and approve applications for new reactors within 18 months. The orders also urge exploring siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The Trump administration set a goal of quadrupling the nation‚Äôs nuclear power plant capacity by 2050. Critics fear that pressure from the White House could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety.</p>

          <p>A US judge overturned Donald Trump‚Äôs executive order targeting Jenner & Block, a law firm that employed a lawyer who investigated him. Trump's order suspended security clearances for the firm‚Äôs lawyers and restricted their access to government buildings and federal contracting work. Trump accused the firm of engaging in activities that ‚Äúundermine justice and the interests of the United States‚Äù because it hired Andrew Weissmann, an attorney who worked on Robert Mueller‚Äôs investigation. The judge ruled that Trump's directive violated core rights under the US constitution.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves a surgery called ventricular shunting to drain excess fluid. Experts emphasize that early diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis, though some symptoms may become irreversible in later stages.</p>
