          <p>AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave reported strong revenue growth in its first earnings release since its IPO, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's revenue soared by 420% year-over-year, driven by increasing demand for its AI infrastructure, particularly from OpenAI, with whom they have a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite the positive results, the stock initially dipped in extended trading, and the company's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs. CoreWeave anticipates significant capital expenditures to support its rapid growth, and the company does not foresee any major issues stemming from President Trump's new tariffs.</p>

          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention in Texas after a federal judge found the government lacked evidence to support his detention. Suri, an Indian national, was detained for two months following allegations of spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media, claims his lawyers deny. The judge stated the government failed to demonstrate that Suri was a threat to U.S. interests, and Suri is now free to return home while the legal challenge to his detention continues.

          <p>Democratic Representative Shri Thanedar ceased his endeavor to compel a vote on impeaching President Trump due to insufficient backing from his own party. The House was anticipated to vote on tabling Thanedar's motion, effectively dismissing it. Thanedar's resolution, filed in April, accused Trump of obstructing justice and abusing presidential power. Fellow Democrat Jamie Raskin noted the necessity of consensus for impeachment efforts. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the attempt as a political stunt. Trump faced two prior impeachments during his initial term.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announced investment deals with Saudi Arabia, analysts suggest that China's established position in the region remains secure. China's strengths in manufacturing and infrastructure building are formidable, even amid increasing competition in the Gulf's hi-tech sectors. The deals announced by Trump in Riyadh were significant, but China's influence is deeply rooted. This dynamic highlights the ongoing competition between the US and China for influence in the Middle East, with Saudi Arabia strategically benefiting from both.</p>

The move comes as studios and theater owners seek to draw audiences back after the pandemic.

The initiative will be a test to whether it cannibalizes higher-priced attendance on other days, Reese said. The company hopes that having one of the bigger chains commit to this is a big deal.</p>
