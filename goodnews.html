          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its acquisition of Hess for $53 billion, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's significant offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. While the outcome is a major victory for Chevron, the company anticipates some headcount reductions as it integrates Hess, continuing its ongoing efforts to streamline operations and cut costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent University of Michigan survey indicates that U.S. consumers' short-term and long-term inflation expectations have fallen to their lowest points since February, before new tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4%, and the five-year forecast slid to 3.6%, reflecting a decrease in fears about tariff-induced price hikes. Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as expectations remain above the levels seen in late 2024.

          <p>A new federal provision titled "no tax on tips" is causing uncertainty regarding its application and who qualifies for the benefit. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a federal income tax deduction of up to $25,000, which phases out for higher earners and is effective from 2025 through 2028. Key questions remain as the IRS has yet to clarify which occupations are eligible and how the deduction interacts with new, higher reporting thresholds for freelance and gig work.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap group Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their pro-Palestinian comments at the Glastonbury festival.

          <h2>Surging Silver Prices Prompt Questions for Precious Metal Investors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 10:00:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of silver recently surging to a decade high of over $38 per ounce, some investors are considering it as a more affordable alternative to gold. The article explores whether gold investors should switch to silver, noting that while silver offers similar portfolio protections like inflation hedging at a lower entry price, it lacks gold's historical stability and value. It concludes that a complete switch is likely unwise, suggesting instead that investors should use the current market to re-evaluate their overall precious metal allocation.

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-funded companies operating in Mexico will be excluded from the trade benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Despite the trade deal's upcoming review in 2026 and ongoing U.S.-China tensions, the envoy anticipates that any revisions will focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting specific countries. This would mean companies might need to source a higher percentage of their product components locally to qualify for preferential treatment.</p>

          <p>Amy Shack Egan, a two-time founder who is currently pregnant with twins while launching her latest startup, Cheersy, highlights the conflict between entrepreneurship and motherhood. She argues that the pervasive "hustle and grind" culture in the startup world is not designed to accommodate the realities of family life, placing a disproportionate burden on female founders. Egan emphasizes the importance of finding a support system and rejecting the notion of "having it all," stating that sacrificing personal time is often necessary to succeed.</p>

          <p>The first known criminal conviction related to the Post Office's Capture accounting software, a precursor to the notorious Horizon system, has been referred to the Court of Appeal. The case involves former sub-postmistress Patricia Owen, who was convicted of theft in 1998 over a £6,000 shortfall. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) referred the conviction on the grounds of abuse of process, marking a significant step for those who believe they were wrongly prosecuted due to flaws in the earlier software system.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 09:15:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers. Industry experts note that kids' content is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which helps reduce customer churn—a major challenge for services like Netflix, Disney+, and others. As media companies focus on profitability, the consistent engagement driven by children's shows provides a stable viewership base, making it a key strategic asset in a market where viewers often drop services due to a lack of use.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's summer transfer strategy is under review after the club spent significantly on attacking midfielders Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha, rather than a traditional number nine. Last season, the team struggled for goals, raising questions about whether current striker Rasmus Hojlund can flourish with enhanced support or if another central forward is still needed. Pundits debate if the new signings' creativity will be enough to solve United's scoring woes or if the club is taking a major risk by not acquiring a proven goalscorer.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition in older adults that affects blood flow in the legs. The diagnosis was made after the president experienced swelling in his legs, and his physician described the condition as "benign." The doctor's statement also confirmed there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis and noted that bruising on Trump's hand was unrelated, likely caused by frequent handshaking.</p>
