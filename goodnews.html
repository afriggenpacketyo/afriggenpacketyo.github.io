          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust reduced visibility to near zero, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office issued such a warning. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the storm, leading to hazardous conditions on major interstates and ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced "mud rain" due to the combination of dust and scattered showers. Several schools closed due to power outages from earlier severe weather, and cooler, drier conditions are expected over the weekend.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is reportedly considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its broader restructuring efforts.

The move reflects Nissan's efforts to streamline operations and address financial challenges in a rapidly changing automotive market.

This adjustment aims to ensure the railway's continued operation and preservation as a historic landmark, with officials not anticipating another price increase in the near future.</p>
