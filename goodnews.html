          <h2>Analysis Determines Renewable Energy Sources are the Most Cost-Effective</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 13:11:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy, even before accounting for government subsidies. The report uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) metric, which shows renewables are more affordable to generate per megawatt-hour compared to fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, or nuclear power. While the upfront capital investment for renewables is high, their operational costs are significantly lower. Experts caution that a diverse energy portfolio is necessary to ensure a consistent power supply, as the intermittent nature of wind and solar requires reliable backup sources.

          <p>In an interview with CBS Mornings, Grammy-winning artist Cardi B addressed her reputation for being outspoken and dramatic, which inspired the title of her upcoming album, "Am I the Drama?" She explained to Gayle King that she does not enjoy conflict but believes her large personality and candid nature make her an easy target for controversy. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, acknowledged that this perception has followed her since high school, where she was voted "most dramatic." She stated that some of the drama in her life is a significant source of stress for her.</p>

          <p>A framework deal has been reached for TikTok's U.S. operations that will involve new investors alongside existing ones from its parent company, ByteDance. The agreement, which is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, will also see Oracle continue its role as the platform's cloud and data security partner. This development comes after years of uncertainty and a congressional mandate for ByteDance to divest its U.S. assets due to national security concerns. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the deal, noting that commercial terms had been in place for months but were delayed by geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <h2>The Reverse Mortgage 6-Month Repayment Rule Explained for Homeowners and Heirs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key feature of reverse mortgages is the "6-month rule," which dictates the timeline for repayment after the borrower passes away or permanently leaves the home. Once this qualifying event occurs, the lender issues a "Due and Payable" letter, giving heirs six months to either repay the loan balance in full or sell the property to settle the debt. This rule primarily applies to federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs). While up to two three-month extensions can be requested from HUD, this guideline highlights the importance of proactive estate planning for borrowers who wish for their families to retain the home.</p>

          <p>Shares of Webtoon Entertainment surged over 35% after the company announced a significant deal with Disney to create a new digital comics platform for the Marvel and Star Wars brands. As part of the agreement, Disney will also acquire a 2% equity stake in Webtoon. This expanded partnership will consolidate over 35,000 comics from Disney's extensive portfolio, including Pixar and 20th Century Studios, into a single subscription service for the first time. Analysts view the deal as a major validation of Webtoon's platform, which could attract other major intellectual property holders and provide a stable, recurring revenue stream for the company.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens, restoring full access to the Visa Waiver Program. This reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that had limited the validity of travel authorizations for Hungarians born outside the country, citing security concerns over a simplified naturalization process. U.S. officials stated that Hungary has now taken sufficient steps to address these vulnerabilities. Effective September 30, travel authorizations for all Hungarian passport holders will once again be valid for two years and allow for multiple entries, signaling a warming of diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest.</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, divers have recovered artifacts from the wreck of the HMHS Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. The vessel, which was serving as a hospital ship during World War I, struck a mine and sank in the Aegean Sea. A specialized deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated trays from the wreck, which lies nearly 400 feet below the surface. After conservation, these artifacts will be displayed in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities in Greece, offering new insights into the historic ship.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's credible threat to let TikTok "go dark" in the United States was the key factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent revealed that while commercial terms had been settled for months, China had put the deal on hold following a U.S. tariff announcement. The president's willingness to prioritize national security over the app's continued operation ultimately broke the stalemate. This development could mark a turning point in U.S.-China relations, with the two nations moving closer to finalizing the agreement for the social media platform's U.S. operations.</p>

          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is remembered not just for his iconic good looks but for a subtle, process-oriented acting style that grounded his performances in realism. In landmark films like "All the President's Men," he embodied a diligent professionalism that made his character's loss of faith in institutions feel authentic. Despite his fame, his craft was often understated, making him a perfect counterpart to more expressive co-stars like Barbra Streisand and Paul Newman. His career, from New Hollywood star to the founder of Sundance, reflects a deep commitment to the art of filmmaking, both on and off the screen.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates recently falling to their lowest point since October 2024, many homeowners are considering refinancing. Experts advise evaluating several factors, including one's current interest rate; homeowners with rates above 7% are encouraged to start exploring options now. Another key consideration is immediate financial need, as refinancing can lower monthly payments or allow for cash-out options to consolidate higher-interest debt. While some analysts predict rates could fall further by year-end, there is an opportunity cost to waiting, as homeowners continue to pay higher interest in the interim. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An F-22 Raptor has successfully executed the longest-known air-to-air missile shot using an AIM-120 AMRAAM, according to manufacturer Raytheon. The test, conducted in late 2024 near Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrated the extended flight capabilities of the missile's F3R variant, which is designed to enhance performance and lethality for fifth-generation aircraft. This milestone highlights the U.S. military's ongoing focus on developing extended-range capabilities to counter advancements made by adversaries like China and Russia. While the exact range is classified, it underscores efforts to keep the AMRAAM relevant as its successor, the AIM-260, approaches service.</p>
