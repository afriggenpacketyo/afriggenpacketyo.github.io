        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kate Middleton has seemingly returned to her traditional brunette hair color after a brief and publicly debated switch to blonde. The Princess of Wales was recently photographed at a rugby match with her familiar darker locks, a change from the lighter hair she sported in preceding weeks. The blonde style had drawn mixed reactions from the public, prompting a strong defense from Princess Diana's former hairstylist, Sam McKnight, who condemned the negative comments. This change comes as the princess continues her public duties following her announcement earlier in the year that she was cancer-free after a challenging nine-month health battle.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, overcame a difficult start to defeat Australia 47-7, securing their place in the World Cup quarter-finals against Scotland. Despite an early lead by the Australian Wallaroos, England rallied to extend their winning streak to 30 consecutive Test matches. The victory was somewhat marred by injuries to key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman, who were forced to leave the field. The match, attended by the Princess of Wales, saw England eventually dominate, with flanker Sadia Kabeya and prop Kelsey Clifford each scoring two tries to seal the comprehensive win.</p>

          <p>Reform UK's latest party conference in Birmingham demonstrates the party's significant growth and increasing political ambition over the past year. The event, held at the expansive NEC, has attracted a large and diverse crowd, including many first-time attendees and disillusioned voters from both the Conservative and Labour parties. The atmosphere combines the energy of an insurgency with the professional organization of a major political party, a unique blend not often seen in British politics. Party leader Nigel Farage's closing speech emphasized the need for discipline and grassroots organization, signaling a focused effort to translate momentum into electoral success.</p>

This final is not only a continuation of their intense on-court battles but also has the world No. 1 ranking at stake, which Sinner will lose to Alcaraz if he is defeated.

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly taking on a prominent role within the Democratic Party as a vocal opponent of Donald Trump. Known for his wealth derived from the Hyatt Hotels family, Pritzker has used his financial resources and political platform to challenge the president. He was instrumental in bringing the Democratic National Convention to Chicago and has been a sharp critic of Trump's policies and rhetoric. This article from The Economist positions Pritzker as a key figure seeking to lead the party's charge against the current administration, leveraging both his political power and personal fortune.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has continued his government reshuffle, making significant changes at the Home Office following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office. Ministers Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have been moved to other departments, with Sarah Jones and Alex Norris joining new Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood. The shake-up, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is seen as an effort by Starmer to reset his government's agenda, particularly on key issues like illegal immigration. Other notable appointments include Anna Turley as Labour Party Chair and business executive Jason Stockwood to a ministerial role in the Lords.</p>

His performance, averaging over 164 mph, narrowly edged out McLaren's Lando Norris, who had momentarily held the top spot. Verstappen's teammate Oscar Piastri qualified third, followed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. However, Hamilton will start in tenth place due to a five-place grid penalty, promoting Mercedes' George Russell to fifth for the start of the race.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the location for his future presidential library and has formed a board to oversee the project. The 13-person governance board includes prominent figures such as former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti. While Biden has deep ties to his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, the decision reflects Delaware's central role in his political career, from his start in local politics to his 36 years as a U.S. Senator. The board now faces the significant challenge of fundraising for the legacy project amid a complex political and philanthropic landscape.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a five-year restoration project aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using targeted cattle grazing as a tool to manage invasive plant species and promote the regrowth of native grasslands. While the transition is celebrated by environmentalists, it has caused heartbreak and economic uncertainty for the multi-generational ranching community and raises questions about the future of local organic dairy production.</p>

          <p>The Trump family is deepening its involvement in the cryptocurrency sector with a series of moves aimed at legitimizing their ventures. Eric Trump's crypto-mining company, American Bitcoin, recently went public on the Nasdaq, and the family's firm, World Liberty Financial, has launched a stablecoin called USD1. The family also netted billions in paper wealth from the release of governance tokens associated with the stablecoin, which now represent one of their most valuable assets. These actions mark a shift from earlier, more speculative ventures like NFTs, creating a more sober corporate image for their crypto empire while still leveraging the Trump brand.

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event officially listed on the Vatican's calendar that signals a new era of acceptance. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Many attendees credited the late Pope Francis for this shift in tone, citing his famous "Who am I to judge?" remark and his ministry to LGBTQ+ individuals. Participants expressed hope that the new pontiff, Pope Leo, will continue Francis's legacy of welcome, which has encouraged many to return to the church after feeling shunned for years.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are turning to Yondr, a company that provides lockable magnetic pouches, to enforce new bans on student cellphone use in classrooms. With rules limiting phone access now active in 35 states, millions of students are required to place their devices in the pouches upon entering school, which can only be unlocked at designated stations. Educators report that the system reduces distractions and encourages more direct social interaction, though student reactions are mixed, with some welcoming the change and others attempting to circumvent it. The cost of the pouches, at roughly $25-30 per student, has also sparked debate about school budget priorities.</p>

          <p>Beijing is extending its long-running anti-corruption campaign into the financial sector, a move that analysts believe will ultimately improve governance and attract foreign investment, despite potential short-term uncertainty. The investigation of a high-profile figure by the Communist Party's disciplinary unit signals a serious effort to clean up the industry, from banking to the stock market. According to an expert from the National University of Singapore, this crackdown caters to the demand from international institutions for cleaner and more transparent markets. While immediate confidence may not rise, the long-term goal is to establish a more stable and trustworthy financial environment in China.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have unearthed the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's deadliest conflicts. To identify these forgotten heroes, historians have turned to forensic genealogy, treating the 240-year-old discovery as an ultimate cold case. By extracting DNA from the bones, experts have built genetic profiles and are now searching for living descendants to help restore the soldiers' names. The remains, which include American, British, and Native American fighters, were given a formal military burial last year, honoring their sacrifice in the nation's fight for independence.</p>
