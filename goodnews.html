          <p>Mexico is experiencing significant tropical weather activity on both its coasts, with two storms forming simultaneously. Tropical Depression Barry made landfall on Mexico's east coast near Tampico, bringing heavy rain and winds, though it is expected to weaken as it moves inland. Meanwhile, on the Pacific coast, Tropical Storm Flossie has formed and is projected to strengthen into a hurricane while remaining offshore. Forecasters have issued warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding across several Mexican states as both systems move through the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax after President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with the country in response to the policy. The tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on large tech firms like Google and Amazon, was a major point of contention with the United States. Canadian officials stated the withdrawal was made "in anticipation" of a new comprehensive trade arrangement, allowing for the resumption of negotiations. The move marks a significant reversal from Canada's previous stance and aims to de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles May Induce Motion Sickness More Frequently</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, can contribute to queasiness. The low-frequency deceleration produced when an EV's kinetic energy is converted back into battery power is a key factor. This issue highlights a comfort and health challenge for the automotive industry as it continues its rapid transition to new energy technologies, prompting investigation into potential solutions.</p>

          <p>A young mountain lion cub that suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull, after being hit by a vehicle has been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center cared for the cub for nearly five months, focusing on medical treatment while ensuring it did not become accustomed to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival instincts, the cub was released into a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful rehabilitation highlights the crucial work of wildlife conservation programs in giving injured animals a second chance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks' celebration of franchise legend Candace Parker was dampened by a 92-85 loss to the Chicago Sky, the other team Parker led to a WNBA title. During a halftime ceremony, Parker's No. 3 jersey was retired, making her just the third player in Sparks history to receive the honor. On the court, however, the Sparks could not contain Sky rookie Angel Reese, who dominated with 24 points and 16 rebounds. Despite a strong third-quarter run, the Sparks were outplayed in the final period, spoiling the otherwise celebratory atmosphere at Crypto.com Arena.</p>
