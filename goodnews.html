          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Allowing Limited Uranium Enrichment in Iran</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly presented a proposal to Iran that would allow limited low-level uranium enrichment to continue within the country for an unspecified period. This proposal includes strict conditions, such as preventing Iran from building new enrichment facilities, dismantling critical infrastructure, and halting research and development on nuclear centrifuges. Iran would also be required to reduce its enrichment concentration to 3% and shut down all underground enrichment facilities for a mutually agreed-upon timeframe. The White House insists that the terms of the deal are tough and designed to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two south Florida divers who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman‚Äôs longline. The divers, believing the line was illegal, released the marine animals and reported the incident to state wildlife officials, but were later charged with theft. Their felony convictions had prevented them from voting, owning firearms, and traveling freely outside the US, and the pardons erase these convictions, with their attorneys expressing gratitude and stating that the case should never have been filed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has temporarily halted its plan to garnish Social Security benefits from individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This decision provides older borrowers, who may rely on fixed incomes, additional time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are currently in default, potentially facing up to a 15% reduction in their Social Security payments. The administration's action aims to alleviate financial strain on retirees who may struggle to cover basic necessities if their benefits are reduced.</p>

          <p>A judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling, by a Trump-appointed judge, limits the administration's practice of rapidly deporting individuals accused of gang membership. The judge found that the government had not provided sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states reaching different conclusions.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging Republican lawmakers to pass his tax bill before the Fourth of July holiday, emphasizing the need for swift action. Amid concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, Trump is dismissing Democratic arguments as misinformation. He claims that there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, asserting that these programs will be saved from Democratic incompetence. This comes as the legislation faces uncertainty due to its inclusion of deep cuts to Medicaid and other programs.</p>
