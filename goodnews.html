          <p>England manager Sarina Wiegman was named women's coach of the year at the 2025 Ballon d'Or ceremony, while goalkeeper Hannah Hampton received the Yashin Trophy for the world's best goalkeeper. The awards recognize their crucial roles in the Lionesses' victory at Euro 2025, where Hampton's penalty shootout saves secured the title. In her acceptance speech, Wiegman championed the growth of women's football and spoke out against misogyny and racism. Hampton also delivered a moving speech, paying tribute to a recently deceased manager and thanking her family for their support.</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced its newest class of ten astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants, who will train for missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and Mars. The diverse group, which for the first time includes more women than men, consists of pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will undergo a two-year training program before becoming eligible for flight assignments.

The profile explores her early development, her unique technical skills, and the personal and professional challenges she faced, including being temporarily dropped from the England squad. Hampton's story is one of resilience, proving doubters wrong to achieve success at the highest level of her sport.</p>

          <p>Amazon is facing a trial in Seattle over allegations from the Federal Trade Commission that the company used deceptive practices to enroll customers in its Prime membership program. The FTC's lawsuit, filed in 2023, claims Amazon utilized manipulative user-interface designs to trick millions of consumers into signing up for automatically renewing subscriptions. Furthermore, the agency alleges that the process for canceling a Prime membership was intentionally complicated and confusing for users. Amazon has denied any wrongdoing, stating that its practices have always prioritized customers, and the trial is expected to last several weeks.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a plan to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok by moving its American operations into a new U.S.-based joint venture. Under this structure, a majority of investors and board members would be American, and software company Oracle would oversee the security of the platform's data and algorithm from "top to bottom." While a senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The move is designed to address national security concerns while allowing the app's 170 million U.S. users to continue using the platform.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. experienced a dramatic surge, closing up nearly 47% after a recommendation from hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's stock, called Better Home "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it could be a "350-bagger" within two years. He highlighted the company's use of artificial intelligence to innovate in the mortgage industry and noted its valuation is significantly lower than that of newly public competitor Figure Technology Solutions. The endorsement caused a massive spike in trading volume and the company's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing the Costs of a $50,000 Home Equity Loan and a HELOC After Recent Fed Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 16:03:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis due to its variable interest rate, which has benefited from the rate cut. However, a home equity loan offers a fixed rate, providing payment stability over the long term. This article breaks down the monthly payment differences and advises homeowners to consider their risk tolerance for potential future rate changes before deciding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to halt construction of the Revolution Wind project, a major offshore wind farm being developed by Danish company Orsted. The judge granted a temporary injunction, allowing work to resume on the project, which is 80% complete and located off the coast of New England. Orsted had sued the Interior Department, arguing the stop-work order was unlawful and issued in bad faith. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry due to concerns about cost and reliability.</p>

The highest probability of precipitation is forecasted for Tuesday and Wednesday, mainly in areas north and east of L.A. County.
