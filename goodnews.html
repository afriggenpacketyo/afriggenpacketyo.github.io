          <p>President Trump teased a potential "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country," leading to reports that the US and UK are on the verge of an agreement. The specifics remain unclear, but talks have been ongoing for weeks, focusing on reducing British tariffs on US cars and agricultural products, and lowering taxes on US tech companies. The UK Prime Minister has stated that reducing food production standards is not a priority, and analysts are unsure if this will be a finalized deal or a framework for negotiation. The announcement is expected to occur at a news conference in Washington DC.</p>

          <p>Public transportation services in Japan are implementing AI to improve lost-and-found operations, with the goal of increasing the return rate of lost items. A "lost-and-found platform" developed by Find Inc. has been introduced in approximately 2,300 locations, including train stations and airports. The AI system registers the color, shape, and other features of lost items using photos taken with tablets. This system allows owners to inquire about lost items through messaging apps by providing related information, which the AI uses to identify possible matches.</p>

          <p>Apple is requesting a court to pause a recent decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that required changes will cost the company "substantial sums." The ruling ordered Apple to stop imposing commissions on in-app purchases made through web links inside its apps and prevents it from restricting app developers from choosing the language or placement of those links. Apple claims that non-party developers are already seizing upon the Order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business. The motion cites a previous order in the case that found that new linking policies would cost Apple "hundreds of millions to billions" of dollars annually.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering buyouts to over 15,000 employees. The agency used the deferred resignation program to downsize the federal workforce, leading to questions about the need to refill positions so soon after letting people go. Rollins stated that the 15,000 employees represent less than 15% of the USDA's workforce and that the department loses 8,000 to 10,000 employees every year through attrition.</p>

Salt Lake City's mayor proposed the adoption of three new city flags, including one featuring the traditional city design imposed over a pride flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. These measures aim to show support for diversity, equity, and inclusion despite state-level restrictions.</p>

The Trump administration believes the rule is overly complex and would stifle American innovation. Chipmakers including Nvidia and AMD have been against the rule.</p>
