          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a match viewed as a significant test for their youth-driven project. Despite being underdogs against the formidable European champions, Chelsea's management remains committed to their long-term strategy, regardless of the final's outcome. The club sees the final as a chance to validate their progress and sustainable model, having already secured significant financial benefits from the tournament. The match also highlights tactical questions for manager Enzo Maresca, who is expected to maintain his attacking style against PSG's intense press.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers player Kobe Brown sustained a right ankle contusion during a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets, forcing him to exit in the third quarter. Before the injury, Brown demonstrated significant potential as a rotational player, scoring 14 points in 20 minutes and impressing with his defense and offensive reads. The team described the decision to hold him out for the rest of the game as precautionary, expressing confidence that the injury is not serious. Teammate Jordan Miller also had a strong performance, contributing 23 points and 11 rebounds in the Clippers' 95-92 victory.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship via a majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout, which concluded their historic trilogy, was a tactical and gripping contest, with two judges scoring it 97-93 for Taylor and one scoring it a 95-95 draw. While not as explosive as their previous encounters, Taylor's smarter, more economical boxing style proved decisive against Serrano's changed approach. Following the victory, Taylor remained non-committal about her future in the sport, suggesting she will take time before making a decision.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, part of a larger 2022 agreement for nearly 1,000 tanks. This $6.7 billion purchase underscores Poland's rapid military expansion in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine and solidifies South Korea's role as a key arms supplier to US allies. As a frontline NATO member, Poland has significantly increased its defense spending, aiming to possess one of Europe's most capable militaries. The deal includes domestic production of a Polish variant, the K2PL, further enhancing Poland's defense industrial base.</p>

          <p>Google has intensified the AI talent war by hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees. The agreement, valued at $2.4 billion, includes compensation and a nonexclusive license for Google to use certain Windsurf technology, while the startup remains an independent entity. This move follows reports that Windsurf had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The deal highlights a growing trend of major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft using large-scale financial deals and "acqui-hires" to secure top-tier talent in the highly competitive artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests across seven counties in Southern California. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit by advocacy groups who presented a "mountain of evidence" that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on race, ethnicity, and location. The judge's order explicitly prohibits agents from using factors like apparent race, speaking Spanish, or being at a day laborer site as the sole basis for a stop. This emergency measure will remain in place while the broader lawsuit, which alleges systemic civil rights violations, proceeds.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a cultural appropriation controversy. The move comes after the company showcased sandals at Milan Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their Indian origins, sparking criticism from fashion critics and politicians in India. Prada stated it held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. The Chamber, which is seeking to patent the traditional design, welcomed the initiative as a potential model for respectful collaboration between global brands and traditional communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against the AI startup Lovo can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company illegally cloned their voices and used them on its text-to-speech platform without permission after hiring them for what they were told were internal projects. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim related to their voices as a concept, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their recordings for AI training will proceed. The case is a significant development in the legal battles between artists and AI companies over the use of creative work.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by growing demand from Chinese companies expanding their international operations. The number of overseas Chinese legal offices has grown significantly, responding to a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from trusted domestic firms. This expansion is also encouraged by Beijing as a way to support the country's global economic footprint. While these firms are successfully serving their existing client base abroad, they face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions and a complex international legal landscape.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted an emergency ban preventing air passengers from carrying substandard power banks on flights. The new rule, effective since June 28, was prompted by a series of incidents where defective portable batteries caught fire during commercial flights. Only power banks with the China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark are now permitted on domestic flights, a regulation that has caused some confusion and led to many devices being abandoned at airports. This safety measure follows earlier restrictions that already prohibited the recharging of power banks and their storage in overhead bins during flights.</p>

          <p>Chinese drugmakers are poised to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with as many as 60 alternatives to popular treatments like Ozempic currently in development. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, much earlier than in other markets. This is expected to pave the way for numerous cheaper generic versions, significantly increasing affordability and access for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic drug companies will compete for market share, driving down prices in a market valued at over $150 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

Port officials acknowledged the current uncertainty in the shipping industry but expressed confidence in the long-term need for growth and investment.

          <p>"The Night We Met," a song by the indie band Lord Huron, has become a massive global success a decade after its quiet release in 2015. Initially the final track on an album that barely charted, the song's popularity surged after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its growth has continued to snowball through its widespread use on TikTok, and it has now accumulated over three billion plays on Spotify alone. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable, wistful theme of a soured relationship, which allows listeners to insert their own stories into it.</p>

The gathering brought together a diverse group of Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and artisans for discussions and a ceremonial fire circle. The King's philosophy, which he once called a "call to revolution," emphasizes the spiritual interconnectedness of all life and advocates for sustainable practices in farming, architecture, and crafts. The event, which included an Earth Elder from an Indigenous tribe and actor Rainn Wilson, is intended to become a regular summit to promote this worldview.</p>
