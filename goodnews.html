          <p>A U.S. District Judge has blocked a presidential proclamation aimed at severely restricting access to the asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. The judge ruled that the Trump administration overstepped its legal authority, stating that federal law does not grant the president the power to unilaterally supplant immigration statutes enacted by Congress. The court's order has been temporarily postponed for 14 days to allow the administration time to file an appeal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The judge determined that the Department of Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate the country's designation before its scheduled expiration in February 2026, a date set by the previous administration. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, arguing that district courts cannot prohibit the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has put forward a new climate goal for the EU to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. The proposal, aimed at achieving climate neutrality by 2050, includes a controversial clause allowing countries to use international carbon credits to meet a small portion of the target. While some member states support the ambitious goal as necessary, others, including Italy and the Czech Republic, have expressed concerns that it is too ambitious or unrealistic.</p>

          <p>India's captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century, helping his team reach a total of 310-5 by the close of the first day's play in the second Test against England at Edgbaston. Despite a strong effort from England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, India established a solid position on what appears to be a favorable batting pitch.

The 2015 photo of Nikumaroro, a remote Pacific island, may show part of her plane's wreckage, possibly exposed by a cyclone. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing an expedition to the island in November to investigate the object and other signs, such as American-made tools, that suggest Earhart and her navigator may have crash-landed there.</p>

          <p>With the economic landscape shifting due to changing inflation and interest rates, savers considering a certificate of deposit (CD) for a sum like $10,000 should first ask several key questions. This article advises evaluating whether a short-term or long-term CD is better, given the current inverted rate environment, and realistically assessing if one can afford to have the funds locked away without incurring early withdrawal penalties. It also stresses comparing CDs to high-yield savings accounts, which offer comparable rates with more liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
