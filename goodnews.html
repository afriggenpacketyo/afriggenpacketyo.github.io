          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker has commented on the conclusion of the "Sex and the City" revival, "And Just Like That," describing the decision to end the series as a respectful choice to conclude on a high note. While suggesting a hiatus is possible, she shifted focus to her literary work with her book imprint, SJP Lit. Parker highlighted her latest book club selection, "I Am You" by Victoria Redel, a historical novel about two female artists in 1600s Amsterdam. She praised the book for its skillful blend of historical fact and dramatic storytelling, exploring themes of ambition, identity, and power.</p>

          <h2>Premier League Nears Decision on Replacing Profit and Sustainability Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 12:06:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has indicated that a decision is approaching on whether to replace the league's current profit and sustainability rules (PSR). The existing regulations, which limit clubs to losses of £105 million over three years, have faced criticism for stifling investment. An alternative being considered is a squad cost ratio (SCR) system, similar to UEFA's model, which would allow clubs to spend a percentage of their revenue on squad-related costs. A final decision on adopting the new financial control system is expected to be made at a meeting in November.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction that continues to puzzle even some Finns. The World Happiness Report measures contentment based on how citizens rate their lives against the best possible life, rather than daily joy. Experts suggest Finland's success stems from a societal structure that provides strong public services, such as extensive free libraries, and fosters a sense of collective well-being through taxation. This contentment is further supported by a deep cultural connection to nature and traditions like sauna use, which promote relaxation and mental health.</p>

          <p>Actress Michelle Pfeiffer, 67, shared that becoming a grandmother last year has profoundly changed her perspective on acting, allowing her to enjoy her work more than ever. Speaking on a podcast, she explained that this life change has helped her feel more relaxed and present, freeing her from previous anxieties about her process. Pfeiffer, who is currently involved in multiple projects including a "Yellowstone" spinoff, says she has given up the deep, prolonged immersion into roles to better balance her personal and professional life. This newfound approach, she believes, has paradoxically made her a better actor.</p>

          <p>Scientific research confirms that regular physical exercise significantly boosts happiness by positively affecting mood-regulating neurochemicals like serotonin and endorphins. While all forms of exercise are beneficial, aerobic activities such as running or cycling appear to have the strongest impact on mood. The article emphasizes that the greatest well-being gains are seen in sedentary individuals who transition from no activity to some, with just 21 minutes of moderate exercise daily meeting federal guidelines.

          <p>McLaren driver and current championship leader Oscar Piastri stated that his challenging weekend at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix taught him important "lessons on risk" for the remainder of the season. In Baku, Piastri crashed in practice and qualifying before crashing out on the first lap of the race, allowing his competitors to narrow his lead in the title chase. He acknowledged that he "tried too hard" and that such weekends are unaffordable in a tight championship fight. As he prepares for the Singapore Grand Prix, Piastri emphasized that he plans to stay focused on the successful strategies that have worked previously.</p>

          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island, Nikumaroro, to investigate an underwater object they believe could be Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery from as far back as 1938, is described as a "visual anomaly" in a lagoon. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers to scan the site before attempting to dredge and identify the object. If confirmed to be Earhart's Electra 10E plane, which disappeared in 1937, it would provide a definitive answer to one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance argues that the enduring conspiracy theories are fueled by public appetite for mystery rather than evidence. The article refutes popular narratives of espionage or capture, asserting that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan most likely ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific. It details how Earhart's husband and publisher, George Palmer Putnam, helped create a polished but sometimes exaggerated public image of her skills. After her death, he and others profited from sensationalized stories, including a fictional film that portrayed her as a patriotic spy, cementing myths that persist to this day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the price of gold reaching new highs in 2025, investors are questioning whether it remains a smart investment. The surge is attributed to global uncertainty and strong buying from central banks, with some analysts predicting further price increases. Gold is often considered a hedge against inflation, as its value tends to hold steady when paper currencies decline. In the current economic landscape, marked by persistent inflation and market volatility, physical gold can also serve as a key tool for portfolio diversification, acting as a safe-haven asset during financial instability.

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum, in a $9.7 billion all-cash deal. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds nearly $344 billion in cash. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock shareholder value and allow the company to resume its stock buyback program. Berkshire Hathaway is already a major shareholder in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake in the Houston-based oil and gas company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with a lower share price have greater upside potential than more expensive ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or growth prospects, which are instead determined by underlying company fundamentals like revenue and earnings growth. Using the example of choosing between a lower-priced stock like International Paper and a higher-priced one like Nvidia in late 2023, the article demonstrates how focusing on fundamentals would have yielded significantly higher returns. It stresses the importance of overcoming cognitive biases for successful investing. (not investment advice)</p>

The company, which makes Gatorade, Cheetos, and Mountain Dew, is removing petroleum-based synthetic dyes from its portfolio in a multi-year process. This shift presents scientific challenges, as researchers must find stable, natural ingredients like paprika, turmeric, and carob powder that do not alter the iconic colors or flavors of its products. Brands like Tostitos and Lay's will be among the first to feature the new, naturally derived colors on store shelves.</p>

          <p>Astronomers studying 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system, have discovered it is releasing a puzzling abundance of nickel and iron. A new analysis of data from the European Very Large Telescope found an extreme ratio of these metals in the object's gaseous tail, a composition that is unusual for comets in our solar system. The presence of vaporized metals at such low temperatures is unexpected, leading researchers to consider that the object is either unusually metal-rich or has unique chemical properties. This finding adds another layer of mystery to the already intriguing interstellar visitor.</p>
