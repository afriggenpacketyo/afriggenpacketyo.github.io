        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australians headed to the polls to elect a new government, with the soaring cost of living and economic uncertainty being the top concerns for voters. Opinion polls suggest that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor party has a slight edge over the conservative opposition. The election comes at a time of heightened geopolitical and trade uncertainty, with Trump's policies and tariffs playing a significant role in the campaign. Albanese has promised modest tax cuts and cheaper healthcare, while Dutton has vowed to slash fuel tax and invest in infrastructure. The election results could come as soon as Saturday night, unless the vote is very tight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. The judge found that the executive order violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth amendments to the Constitution, determining that it sought to punish the firm for representing clients and holding employment policies disfavored by the president. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele. The judge said the executive order was issued as retribution for Perkins Coie's work and Mr. Trump's grievances.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Cat Remains Found in Shipwreck Suggest Early Feline Arrival in the Americas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 19:51:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The remains of two domestic cats, an adult and a juvenile, were discovered in the wreckage of a 500-year-old Spanish ship that sank in Florida's Pensacola Bay in 1559. Researchers believe these remains likely represent the earliest example of cats in what is now the United States. Cats were often brought on ships to hunt rats and mice, and analysis suggests the adult cat's diet consisted mainly of fish and possibly domestic meat. While it's unclear if the cats were intentionally brought on board, their presence indicates they may have served as pest control and were potentially cared for by the sailors.</p>

          <p>A military parade will be held in Washington DC to mark the US Army's 250th anniversary on June 14th, which is also President Trump's birthday. The event will feature thousands of soldiers, vehicles, and aircraft. Trump first proposed a military parade during his first term but scrapped the idea due to cost concerns. In addition to the parade, Trump has announced plans to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" and VE Day as "Victory Day for World War II," though it's unclear if these will become federal holidays.</p>

          <p>Leah T. Wilson, the executive director of the State Bar of California, will step down in July after facing criticism over the botched rollout of a new bar exam. The exam was plagued by technical glitches and irregularities, and the State Bar was also not transparent about using artificial intelligence to develop multiple-choice questions. Wilson apologized for the issues but signaled that California should ultimately push ahead with its own bar exam. Her departure comes as thousands of February test takers await their exam results.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will cancel 35 roundtrip flights a day from its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport after thousands of passengers faced hourslong delays. CEO Scott Kirby blamed the disruptions on air traffic controller staffing shortages and the Federal Aviation Administration's technology problems. The flight cuts amount to about 10% of United's daily schedule at its Newark hub. Kirby said the airline is now urging the agency to more tightly control capacity at the airport by establishing flight restrictions.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products from China directly to customers in the United States, with all U.S. orders now shipped from local warehouses in America. This change follows the Trump administration's decision to close a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese-made items to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices after the tariff change and started adding import charges for U.S. customers. The company says pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model.</p>

The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, outpacing analysts' predictions.

          <h2>Court Battle Likely Over Trump's Executive Order to Defund Public Broadcasting</h2>

          <p>President Trump issued an executive order to end government dollars for the Corp. for Public Broadcasting (CPB), but this effort faces stiff opposition and a likely court battle. The CPB asserts that Congress, not the president, has the power to cut off its funding. Public media outlets such as PBS and NPR are exploring all options to challenge the order, which they view as an affront to their First Amendment rights. Legal experts suggest the CPB could argue viewpoint discrimination in court.</p>

          <h2>Waltz Used Signal-Like App at White House Day Before Ouster as National Security Advisor</h2>

          <p>Former White House national security advisor Mike Waltz and other Trump officials appear to be communicating on a modified version of Signal, despite President Donald Trump discouraging use of the messaging app. The app Waltz was using appeared to be a version of Signal with modifications from TeleMessage, which adds an archiving capability. TeleMessage is known as a "fork" of Signal, meaning it copies parts of the app and makes adjustments to other parts of its code.</p>

          <h2>Reform UK Gains in English Local Elections</h2>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in English local elections, solidifying its position as a challenger to Britain's main parties. The party won hundreds of seats and gained control of several authorities from the Conservatives. Reform's success has increased scrutiny of how it will perform in office and wield its newly-acquired local powers. Farage said his party would seek to "reduce excessive expenditure" in local government and scale back local diversity and climate policies.</p>
