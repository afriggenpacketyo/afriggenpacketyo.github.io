          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive performance contrasted with broader downturns across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were affected by concerns originating from the U.S. banking sector and trade tensions. While markets in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Japan saw significant declines, the resilience of the Kospi highlights investor confidence in the potential outcomes of the trade discussions. The broader regional weakness followed a sell-off on Wall Street fueled by fears over bad loans held by some U.S. regional banks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-acting injection designed to prevent HIV, known as cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use by the NHS in England and Wales. This development brings the policy in line with Scotland and offers an alternative to daily pills for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). The injection, administered every other month, is intended for individuals at high risk of acquiring HIV for whom daily oral medication is not a practical option. Health experts are hopeful that this new method will be a significant step toward the goal of eliminating new HIV cases in the UK by 2030, providing a more convenient and discreet prevention tool.</p>

          <p>Following a phone call, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The renewed diplomatic effort comes after a ceasefire was achieved in the Middle East, allowing the administration to refocus on the European conflict. As a form of leverage, the White House is considering supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a topic President Trump plans to discuss with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Kremlin has expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue but remains cautious, while analysts speculate this could be a pivotal moment to increase pressure on Moscow.</p>

          <p>This analysis explores the immense pressure facing 18-year-old basketball prodigy Cooper Flagg as he enters the NBA with the Dallas Mavericks. The article frames his arrival within the historical context of the "Great White Hope" narrative in American sports, a mythos born from a desire to find a white champion in predominantly Black leagues. Flagg, an exceptionally talented two-way player from Maine, joins a Mavericks franchise historically defined by white superstars like Dirk Nowitzki and Luka Dončić. He must navigate not only the on-court challenge of leading a team but also the complex racial and cultural expectations that have been projected onto him.</p>

          <p>England's fast bowler Mark Wood has stated he is "quietly confident" about being fit for the first Test of the Ashes series against Australia. Wood has been sidelined since February due to a knee injury that required surgery in March, causing him to miss the entire summer cricket season. He described his rehabilitation as having ups and downs but noted that his recent progress in a training camp has been positive, with his bowling pace increasing. The 35-year-old is hopeful that with good form in practice games, he will be ready for the series opener in Perth on November 21.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chief executive of Greene King, a major UK pub chain, has identified cafes and food delivery apps as emerging rivals for the leisure time and spending of consumers. Nick Mackenzie acknowledged that as a growing portion of the population, particularly younger people, do not drink alcohol, businesses like coffee shops are capturing a share of the market traditionally held by pubs. To adapt, pubs are improving their food and coffee offerings and creating more comfortable environments to attract a broader customer base. The industry is also exploring "competitive socialising" activities to remain relevant in a changing consumer landscape.</p>

          <p>Indonesia is actively pursuing direct export channels to ship its fresh durians to China, a move aimed at increasing profits by eliminating the need for intermediaries in neighboring countries. Currently, Indonesian durians often pass through Malaysia and Thailand, which assist with the cold-chain storage and phytosanitary approvals required by Chinese customs. By establishing a direct trade route, Indonesia hopes to capture a larger share of the lucrative Chinese market, which consumes over 90% of the world's durian supply. The country's deputy agriculture minister stated this initiative could boost profits for growers by an average of 10 to 30 percent.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, the commander of U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), has announced his retirement, effective in December. Holsey has been overseeing military operations in a region that includes the Caribbean Sea, where U.S. forces have recently conducted a series of deadly strikes against boats alleged to be carrying drugs. The announcement comes as the strikes face growing scrutiny from some members of Congress over their legal justification. Holsey, who took command of SOUTHCOM in November, stated it has been an honor to serve the nation for over 37 years. The Defense Secretary thanked the admiral for his decades of service.</p>

          <p>The UK government has begun rolling out a digital identity card for military veterans, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This new digital ID is optional and will allow the approximately 1.8 million eligible veterans to more easily prove their status to access dedicated services, such as healthcare, housing support, and retail discounts. Ministers suggest this initiative can serve as a case study to demonstrate the functionality and security of a planned, more comprehensive digital ID system for all UK citizens and residents. The digital veteran card will be the first document stored in the government's new One Login smartphone app.</p>

          <p>Mookie Betts showcased his elite defensive skills at shortstop, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 3-1 playoff victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. A spectacular play by Betts to start the ninth inning was a key moment in the game, which leaves the Dodgers just one win away from advancing to the World Series. Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner as an outfielder, has made a remarkably successful transition to the infield, silencing earlier doubts about his ability to play the demanding position. His consistent defense, combined with a resurgent offensive performance in the postseason, has been a critical factor in the Dodgers' success.</p>
