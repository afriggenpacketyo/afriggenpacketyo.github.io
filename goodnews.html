Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia to face the charges after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney asserts that the charges are an abuse of power and that his client will not be convicted. His arraignment is scheduled for June 13.</p>

          <p>Liam Dawson's recent performance highlights what England has been missing, as he returned to the team after two years and six months. Despite being consistently overlooked, Dawson's absence was a topic of discussion among county fans, especially given his leading role as a spinner in the County Championship. England's managing director previously noted Dawson's reluctance to be a reserve player, but now, under captain Harry Brook, his dependable nature is seen as a strength. Dawson's return marks a shift towards valuing consistency and reliability in the team.</p>

          <p>Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman advises that when facing difficulties, engaging in something even more challenging can help break through the slump. Huberman explains that doing something harder deploys dopamine at a higher level, leading to a more effective bounce back. He suggests that this approach, based on the dynamics of dopamine, can help people overcome mental roadblocks. This mindset focuses on taking on anything that's considered "harder," even if the project isn't directly related to the initial challenge.</p>

          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved Welsh dish of toasted bread covered in a seasoned cheese sauce, has varied origin stories, with some suggesting it began as a joke by the English. While some believe it was a clever substitute for meat used by poor farmers, others think English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves associates rarebit with Welsh culture, noting cheese's importance in European diets, especially in Wales. The name "Welsh rarebit" appeared later, with early English cookbooks using terms like "Welsh rabbit" for similar recipes.</p>
