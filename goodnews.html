        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting in October. This system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. Travelers will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks on their first entry, with the registration remaining valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns have been raised about potential long queues and delays during the initial rollout phase at key transit points like Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching a historic $1.8 billion, an Alabama woman has a unique plan for the potential winnings. Susie Conerly told a local news station that her first priority would be to use a portion of the prize money to pay the buyout clause for Alabama Crimson Tide's head football coach, Kalen DeBoer. Her dissatisfaction follows the team's recent loss to Florida State. DeBoer's buyout is estimated to be around $63 million, a sum well within the jackpot's cash value of approximately $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, securing the win with just one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls was crucial after Somerset's chase of 191 seemed unlikely. The victory propels Somerset to their record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day, where they are set to face Lancashire in the semi-final.</p>

          <p>Despite an unsettled and error-prone first half, England's Red Roses secured a decisive 47-7 victory over Australia, advancing to the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals. Australia initially took the lead and challenged England's renowned set-piece dominance, causing several fumbles and disruptions. However, England eventually found their rhythm, pulling away in the second half to maintain their 30-match winning streak. While the final score was convincing, the team's early struggles against a lower-ranked opponent may provide insights for stronger rivals later in the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Chargers and Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is a key component of the league's broader strategy for sustained international growth. Rather than staging one-off events, the NFL aims to build a year-round presence in new markets, with teams committing to long-term engagement. The game, held in a sold-out stadium, is part of a record seven international matchups this season, with future games planned for Madrid, Dublin, and Melbourne. This approach, which includes local media deals and fan events, is designed to cultivate a global fanbase and establish American football as a major international sport.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the uninspired performance has raised questions about the team's progress under manager Thomas Tuchel. An own goal gave England the lead before Declan Rice added a second, securing a win that solidifies their top position in the group. However, the team struggled to create clear chances against the world's 174th-ranked side, leading to a subdued atmosphere and criticism that the squad has not improved since the Euro 2024 final. The performance puts pressure on the team ahead of a more challenging upcoming match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has set a new record for the fastest lap in Formula 1 history while securing pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. His lap, with an average speed of 164.466 mph, surpassed the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars having lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's long straights. Verstappen's achievement marks a significant moment in the sport, as the 2020-era cars were widely considered the fastest in F1 history.</p>

While retaining an "insurgency vibe," the conference reflects a party attempting to build the infrastructure of a major political force. Leader Nigel Farage's speech emphasized the need for discipline and focus, signaling a clear intent to move beyond a protest movement and seriously contest for power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing foreign governments that wrongfully detain U.S. citizens. The order empowers the State Department to create a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which can trigger sanctions, visa restrictions, and other penalties against offending nations. This new authority is modeled after the existing "state sponsor of terrorism" classification. The move is intended to create a significant deterrent and increase the consequences for countries that use American citizens as political bargaining chips, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>
