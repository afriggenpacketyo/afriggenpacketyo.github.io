          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a specific version of a DNA repair protein in naked mole-rats that is linked to their remarkable longevity and disease resistance. This protein, also present in humans, suggests potential for new therapeutic anti-aging strategies to enhance human health and lifespan. The findings, published in 'Science,' provide a molecular basis for the exceptional lifespan observed in these burrowing rodents. This discovery could pave the way for future medical advancements in extending human life.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and mainland China's CSI 300 seeing gains, despite the release of China's 4.8% Q3 GDP growth, which was in line with expectations but indicated underlying weaknesses. Japan's Nikkei 225 also surged after a coalition government agreement. This market resilience suggests investors are parsing the economic data while also reacting to other regional developments and a softening U.S. stance on trade talks with China. The broader market sentiment appears to be looking past immediate economic concerns in favor of other positive catalysts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British military will be granted new authority to shoot down drones posing threats near military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster and more decisive action. This 'kinetic option' will initially apply to military sites but could extend to civilian locations like airports, following numerous drone incursions reported at UK airbases used by US forces. The move comes amidst wider European concerns about drone activity, with several EU states backing a 'drone wall' against potential Russian incursions.</p>

          <p>Christian McCaffrey delivered an exceptional performance for the San Francisco 49ers, accumulating 201 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns, leading his team to a 20-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. The 49ers' defense also played a crucial role, limiting the Falcons' offense despite being depleted by injuries. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. struggled against the San Francisco defense, which held star running back Bijan Robinson to minimal gains. This win improves the 49ers' record to 5-2, showcasing their resilience even with key players sidelined.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, asserts that a multi-sensor system, including LiDAR, is superior and safer for self-driving vehicles compared to Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu argues that vision-only systems cannot account for many 'corner cases' and are insufficient for Level 3 or 4 automation, citing challenges like detecting white cars in bright light or black cars in tunnels. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as 'expensive and unnecessary,' Qiu highlights significant cost reductions and improved performance, with other auto executives also supporting LiDAR's critical role.</p>
