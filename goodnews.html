          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, aged in their 80s, have defied church authorities by leaving their assigned care home and returning to their former convent near Salzburg. The nuns, who had spent most of their lives at the Kloster Goldenstein convent, stated they were moved against their will after the community was dissolved. With the help of former students, they regained access to their old apartments, sparking a dispute with church officials who cite health and safety concerns for their relocation. The nuns are now receiving support from the local community and are determined to remain in their lifelong home.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel has officially begun his role as the music and artistic director designate of the New York Philharmonic, opening the orchestra's fall season. His highly anticipated arrival brings hope for a revitalization of the orchestra's prominence, reminiscent of the Leonard Bernstein era. For his opening night, Dudamel led performances of works by Bartók and Charles Ives, pieces with deep connections to New York City's musical history.

          <p>As hundreds of thousands of new students prepare to start university, current students are sharing their advice on how to navigate the transition. Tips from the "class of 2024" include remembering that everyone is nervous, not placing too much importance on fresher's week for making lifelong friends, and the value of joining societies to find like-minded people. Students also emphasize practical advice, such as doing the washing up to maintain good flatmate relations, and the importance of seeking pastoral support to manage mental health. The consensus is that university is a learning curve and newcomers should give themselves grace as they adjust.</p>

          <p>Actor Sean Astin, widely known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy, has been elected the new national president of SAG-AFTRA. He will lead the 160,000-member performers' union as it faces critical challenges, including upcoming contract negotiations with major studios in 2026. Astin succeeds Fran Drescher, who led the union through a lengthy strike in 2023 that secured new protections regarding artificial intelligence and streaming residuals. Astin has pledged to build on those gains, particularly on AI, and to work to keep productions in the U.S., signaling a determined approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser, taller apartment buildings near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit buildings up to nine stories high adjacent to major train and bus routes. Proponents argue the measure is essential for creating much-needed housing in existing communities, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, contend it is a "one-size-fits-all" mandate that strips local control. A deal with a construction union was key to its passage.</p>

          <p>The science fiction concept of a universal translator is moving closer to reality as major tech companies invest heavily in real-time language translation. Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods, allowing for near-instantaneous audio translation between languages like Spanish and English. This development places Apple in direct competition with Google, which has a similar feature for its Pixel phones that preserves a speaker's voice, and Meta, which is integrating translation into its smart glasses.

          <p>Documents reviewed by Reuters show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook declared her Atlanta property as a "vacation home" on a loan estimate, potentially countering accusations of mortgage fraud from the Trump administration. Officials have accused Cook of improperly claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences to gain favorable mortgage and tax terms. However, the loan document from her credit union indicates she informed the lender of her intent to use the Atlanta property as a second home. This evidence could support Cook's defense in an ongoing investigation. (not investment advice)</p>
