          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's second state visit to the U.K. is characterized by significant royal pomp and pageantry, aiming to strengthen the long-standing "special relationship" between the two countries. The President and First Lady Melania were formally welcomed by King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, including gun salutes and a carriage procession. Despite the ceremonial splendor, the visit quickly encountered controversy with four arrests made after images of Trump alongside convicted sexual offender Jeffrey Epstein were projected onto the castle. The agenda also includes high-level discussions on business deals, partnerships, and critical geopolitical issues such as the wars in the Gaza Strip and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicts that new AI investments, including a $30 billion package from Microsoft, could boost the UK economy by 10% within five years. This major "Tech Prosperity Deal" with several US tech giants aims to significantly enhance Britain's AI sector through data centers and a new supercomputer in Essex. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a "generational step change" in UK-US relations, promising highly skilled jobs. While acknowledging AI's high energy consumption and the cyclical nature of tech, Nadella stressed its potential benefits across healthcare, public services, and business productivity.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a golden era in basketball, recently winning the Eurobasket crown, following World Championship and Olympic gold successes. However, the rise of Name, Image, Likeness (NIL) provisions in US colleges poses a significant challenge to the development of German domestic basketball. NIL allows US college athletes to earn substantial money, comparable to top European club salaries, attracting young German talent like Hannes Steinbach to the US. While this offers opportunities for individual players, the BBL seeks compensation for player training and fears a changing landscape, urging FIBA and NCAA to find a solution to protect European development.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a comprehensive 19-point plan to stimulate domestic service consumption, aiming to expand internal demand for economic growth. The measures, jointly released by the Ministry of Commerce and other departments, include relaxing market access and increasing supply across sectors like culture, sports, and healthcare. Authorities pledged to enhance cultural offerings, extend museum hours, and attract more international sports events. Additionally, the plan seeks to reduce red tape for foreign and private investment in high-end medical care, expand visa-free access for tourists, and encourage financial institutions to offer more consumer loans and interest subsidies in key areas.

          <p>Jose Mourinho is reportedly considering a return to Benfica, potentially replacing Bruno Lage, who was sacked following a Champions League defeat. Club president Rui Costa expressed the need for a "winner" to lead the team to desired titles, with a new manager expected by Saturday. Mourinho, recently dismissed by Fenerbahce, is said to be open to returning to work in Portugal, two decades after his initial departure from Benfica. His potential appointment would mark a high-profile comeback for the manager who previously achieved significant success with Porto, setting up an intriguing Champions League clash against Chelsea.</p>

          <p>British pharmaceutical giant GSK announced a commitment to invest at least $30 billion in US research, development, and manufacturing over the next five years. This significant investment, including $1.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and AI technologies, aligns with pressure from the Trump administration for firms to bolster US production and lower drug prices. GSK's CEO Emma Walmsley highlighted the "strong R&D and supply chain" already in the US. This follows similar pledges from other global pharma companies and contributes to a wave of multi-billion-dollar AI investments in the UK during Trump's state visit, symbolizing strengthened transatlantic ties.

          <p>Donald Trump's unprecedented second UK state visit is seen as a crucial opportunity to deepen trade and business ties between the two nations, especially given the UK's stagnating economy. The visit, leveraging the monarchy's "tiara diplomacy," has already seen multi-billion-dollar investments announced by US tech and financial giants like Nvidia, OpenAI, and Blackstone. Discussions also include nuclear power agreements. While the UK hopes to secure "AI sovereignty" and further trade concessions, the visit is also politically sensitive, with potential questions about past controversies and the unpredictability of the President's public statements.</p>

          <p>China's renowned Yiwu International Trade Market, once dominated by US exports, is significantly shifting its customer base towards the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America. This pivot is a direct consequence of the ongoing US-China trade war, with US tariffs driving Chinese suppliers to seek more stable, albeit less lucrative, markets. While total export value to the US remains higher, the rate of decline and new fees on China-made cargo are pushing businesses to diversify. This strategic reorientation, exemplified by Yiwu's growing ties with non-Western markets, highlights China's broader effort to reduce reliance on the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed a "forgotten" royal castle at Finlaggan on the Scottish island of Islay, believed to have been a home to kings ruling parts of western Scotland over 700 years ago. The fortress, built across two small islands in a loch, predates the powerful MacDonald Lords of the Isles, who later established their center of power at the same site. The remains reveal a rectangular stone tower, similar to English keeps, featuring living quarters, a great hall, and a chapel. This discovery offers new insights into the region's early history and the assertion of power and wealth by Anglo-French kings before the rise of the Lords of the Isles.</p>

Owners of these species, such as Redline Snakehead and Alligator Gar, are urged to hand them over to authorities for confinement in state-run aquariums.
