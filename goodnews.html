          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the fundamental principle of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Courts have consistently held that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially given Trump officials' expansive claims of power. Legal scholars have praised the courts for upholding constitutional principles, while also expressing concern that such intervention was necessary in the first place.</p>
