          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a bill into law that prohibits citizens from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia from buying property in Texas, excluding US green card holders and citizens. The law, which takes effect September 1, allows visa holders from those countries to purchase property only for use as a primary residence, not for investment purposes. Critics are planning a lawsuit challenging the bill's constitutionality, setting up a potential legal battle. Abbott has publicly expressed his support for the bill on social media. The implications of this law could have far-reaching effects on international relations and economic investment in Texas.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski discusses navigating Washington, D.C., as a moderate Republican during the Trump era in her new memoir, "Far from Home: An Alaskan Senator Faces the Extreme Climate of Washington, D.C." She emphasizes her allegiance is to the people of Alaska, rather than the Republican Party, and acknowledges her independent streak after winning a write-in campaign in 2010. Murkowski, who never voted for Donald Trump, expresses concern over Congress ceding its authority to the executive branch, particularly regarding spending and tariffs. She acknowledges the importance of relationships for her effectiveness in the Senate, despite not supporting President Trump and his active campaigning against her.</p>

The Democratic Party for the People is also expected to mark its first victory in the Tokyo assembly election. This election is seen as a significant indicator of voter sentiment and could influence the national political landscape, with key issues including inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday following the United States' entry into the war between Israel and Iran and strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, while Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down 0.3%. Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was a major gainer, closing 2.7% higher, while Bahrain issued a "work from home mandate" to maintain public safety. Analysts suggest the Gulf has distanced itself from the conflict and is supporting a peaceful resolution, which has helped to isolate it from any significant short-term market impact, with a net mid-term positive outlook.</p>

          <p>Parenting expert Reem Raouda shares five phrases that can hinder cooperation in children and offers alternative phrases to promote better communication and behavior. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while respectful language fosters autonomy and cooperation. The recommended phrases focus on explaining decisions, providing agency, validating emotions, problem-solving, and encouraging self-reflection. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
