          <p>Coco Gauff, the world number two, secured her spot in the French Open semifinals by defeating fellow American Madison Keys in a three-set match. Despite a shaky start, Gauff rallied to win 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 6-1, showcasing her resilience under the Court Phillippe Chatrier roof. Gauff acknowledged Keys' formidable forehand and emphasized the importance of court coverage in her strategy. Having previously won the French Open doubles title in 2024, Gauff is set to face either Mirra Andreeva or Lois Boisson in the next round, with hopes of continuing her successful run in the tournament.</p>

          <h2>Leprosy Existed in the Americas Before European Contact, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 10:43:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that leprosy, long believed to have been introduced to the Americas by European colonizers, was already present on the continent for thousands of years. Researchers analyzed over 800 ancient remains from Canada and Argentina, discovering a different species of leprosy-causing bacteria, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was circulating among indigenous populations. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the origins of leprosy in the Americas and highlights the complex history of pathogens and their interactions with humans. The study also suggests that monitoring disease reservoirs in animals is crucial for preventing future spillovers to humans.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a ¬£15 billion investment plan targeting transport infrastructure across England, with a focus on mayoral authorities in the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects, including extensions to the Greater Manchester tram network, the West Midlands metro, and the commencement of the West Yorkshire Mass Transit programme. This initiative signals a shift from stringent Treasury rules that have historically favored London and the south-east, aiming to address regional economic disparities. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some welcoming the investment while others caution about ensuring the long-term sustainability of the new transport networks.

          <p>Private equity professionals at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin have expressed increased optimism regarding investment opportunities in Europe, a notable shift from the previous year's sentiment. This change is occurring amid subdued dealmaking, low IPO activity, and lackluster returns, coupled with volatile policymaking in the United States. Factors contributing to this positive outlook include falling interest rates and Germany's substantial fiscal package. Blackstone's Vice Chairman Thomas Nides noted that increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. makes investing in Europe a favorable choice, while acknowledging that Trump's policies create uncertainty in the market.

          <p>According to his biographer, Stephen Witt, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, despite leading a highly successful company valued at nearly $3.4 trillion, is primarily driven by negative emotions, particularly fear of failure, paranoia about competition, and guilt about letting people down. Witt, who interviewed Huang for six hours, noted that this anxiety serves as his primary motivator, pushing him to work relentlessly. This revelation contrasts with the typical upbeat and optimistic persona often associated with successful CEOs. Huang's discomfort when things are going well underscores the extent to which his drive stems from a constant need to prove himself.</p>
