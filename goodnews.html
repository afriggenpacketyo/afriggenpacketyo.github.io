          <p>Meng Fanli, the current party chief of Shenzhen, has been promoted to party chief of Guangdong's government, effectively making him the governor-in-waiting for China's largest provincial economy. The 60-year-old's appointment is expected to be formally confirmed by the provincial legislature soon. This move fills the vacancy left by incumbent Governor Wang Weizhong, who was recently promoted to party chief of Inner Mongolia. The personnel changes follow a monthly Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, a common time for such high-level provincial appointments.</p>

Quarterback Bo Nix delivered a strong performance, completing 29 of 42 passes for 326 yards and two touchdowns, while the Broncos' defense stifled the Bengals' offense, sacking backup quarterback Jake Browning three times. Running back J.K. Dobbins also broke a long-standing team record by rushing for over 100 yards. The Bengals, now 2-2, struggled significantly without injured star quarterback Joe Burrow, highlighting their offensive challenges.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new peace plan for Gaza, calling on Hamas to accept its terms. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of military operations, the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of deceased hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. The plan stipulates no future governance role for Hamas and leaves open the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state. While the Palestinian Authority and several Arab nations welcomed the initiative, Netanyahu vowed to "finish the job" of destroying Hamas if the group rejects the agreement.</p>

          <p>Zhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, a Chinese national, has been convicted in the UK for her central role in what is believed to be the world's largest single cryptocurrency seizure, valued at over £5 billion ($6.7 billion). Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the bitcoin, which originated from a large-scale scam in China between 2014 and 2017 that defrauded over 128,000 victims. The Metropolitan Police's seven-year investigation, spanning multiple jurisdictions, led to her arrest after she fled China using false documents and attempted to launder money by buying property in the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service is working to ensure the stolen funds are returned, with many victims having already received compensation through a Chinese scheme.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 22:44:31 EDT</div>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs, found malnourished and alone earlier this year, have been successfully rehabilitated and released back into the San Diego County wilderness. The cubs received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to encourage natural hunting behaviors. This release is a positive development for the "near-threatened" species, whose wild population in California is significantly lower than previously estimated, facing constant risks from vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment. The rehabilitation efforts aim to prevent human-wildlife conflict by ensuring the lions remain in rural areas.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite winning a World Series in 2020, feel a renewed urgency to secure another title after an underwhelming regular season and recent postseason disappointments. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledges the team's "edge" and determination to overcome past failures, especially with their record-setting $400-million roster. Entering the playoffs with a wild-card series against the Cincinnati Reds, the Dodgers face new challenges, including a healthy starting rotation but a questionable bullpen. The team aims to find a new identity for the postseason, building on a strong finish to the regular season and hoping for key players like Max Muncy and Tommy Edman to be healthy.</p>

          <p>Paralympic long jumper and sprinter Stef Reid is campaigning for major footwear brands like Nike, Adidas, and Puma to sell single shoes, rather than pairs. As an amputee, Reid only needs one shoe for her prosthetic but is forced to buy two, leading to wasted money and a disconnect between inclusive marketing and actual consumer experience. Reid, who lost a foot in a boat accident at 15, transitioned from rugby to athletics, becoming a world champion and MBE recipient. Her campaign highlights a broader issue affecting amputees and individuals with different-sized feet, advocating for practical inclusivity in the retail industry.</p>

          <p>An article suggests that Hong Kong should become China’s gateway to the United Nations, potentially serving as the UN’s Asia headquarters. This move could support the organization's reforms and reinforce Beijing's vision of global governance, particularly given Asia's large population and the UN's limited presence there. Hong Kong's unique attributes, including English as an official language, common law, and low corporate taxes, make it an ideal location. Leveraging institutions like the International Organisation for Mediation, Hong Kong could enhance China's engagement with the UN, where China is already the second-largest donor, effectively bringing the world to China.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). Judge Royce Lamberth ruled against the job cuts, which would affect the vast majority of VOA's remaining staff, citing "concerning disrespect" towards the court's previous orders to restore VOA programming. The Trump administration, which had signed an executive order to effectively shut down the broadcaster, faces ongoing legal challenges regarding its actions against VOA, a government-funded entity designed to project American values and counter authoritarian propaganda globally.</p>

The April SNL sketch drew widespread criticism for perceived misogyny and prompted an apology from show bosses. Wood's new BBC romantic-comedy drama "Film Club," which she co-wrote, explores themes of loneliness, love, and mental health, drawing inspiration from her pandemic experiences.</p>

Critics on social media decried the choice of a predominantly Spanish-language artist known for progressive stances, viewing it as a "woke" cultural infiltration. The NFL's partnership with Jay-Z's Roc Nation for halftime productions has consistently featured diverse artists, often drawing similar conservative condemnation. Bad Bunny, Spotify's most-streamed male artist, expressed that the performance is for "my people, my culture and our history," acknowledging the significance beyond himself.</p>
