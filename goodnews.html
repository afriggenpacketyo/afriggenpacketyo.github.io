          <p>European defense company shares experienced a significant rally, with firms like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt seeing gains of up to 5%. This market movement followed U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in stance, where he expressed that Ukraine could win back all its territory from Russia with European and NATO support. The broader European Stoxx 600 index, however, trended lower, influenced by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about inflated asset prices. The surge in defense equities highlights the market's sensitivity to geopolitical statements and shifts in military support expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine has the potential to "win all of Ukraine back in its original form." This declaration, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede territory for peace. Trump attributed his changed view to a new understanding of the military situation and Russia's economic troubles, labeling Russia a "paper tiger." Zelensky praised the "big shift" in Trump's position, viewing it as a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised a "productive meeting" with U.S. President Donald Trump, after which Trump publicly stated that Ukraine could win back all its occupied territory. Zelenskyy described the pivot as a "big shift," noting that the U.S. president now seems well-informed about the battlefield situation. The change in rhetoric was met with cautious optimism by some Ukrainian politicians, who emphasized that concrete actions must follow the words. Others remained skeptical, suggesting the statement might be a way for the U.S. to distance itself while encouraging European allies to provide more support.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches at Bethpage, New York, experts and players are analyzing how Team Europe can secure its first away victory since 2012. A key challenge will be managing the notoriously raucous American crowd, with captain Luke Donald preparing his players for a "bear pit" atmosphere. The European team benefits from significant continuity, with only one change from their victorious 2023 squad, a historical marker of success. Veteran players like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, along with the consistent leadership of Donald, are seen as crucial elements in overcoming the home-field advantage and pressure.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in the past year by using a new artificial intelligence tool designed to detect fraud. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the rest coming from areas like illegal council tax claims. The tool, named the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, scans new policies for potential weaknesses before they can be exploited. The UK now plans to license this technology to other countries, including the US and Australia, despite ongoing criticism from civil liberties groups about the government's use of AI.</p>

          <p>China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, welcomed a bipartisan delegation of U.S. House Representatives to Beijing, labeling their visit an "ice-breaking journey." This marked the first such trip by a U.S. congressional group in six years. During the meeting, Wang emphasized that China and the U.S. should be partners, not rivals, and urged Washington to respect its commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit is seen as a cautious step toward reopening channels of communication and stabilizing the strained relationship between the two global powers, offering a rare moment of direct legislative engagement.</p>

          <p>In a significant move, China has announced it will no longer seek "special and differential treatment" reserved for developing countries in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. Premier Li Qiang made the declaration at the UN General Assembly, positioning China as a responsible major country committed to multilateralism and free trade. The decision was praised by WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as "major news" and key to reforming the organization. This policy shift addresses long-standing criticism, primarily from the U.S., that China has unfairly benefited from development privileges despite being the world's second-largest economy.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A court found she was taken off the air due to her political views after sharing a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, following lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The judge called the penalty "substantial" and necessary to ensure the ABC learns from its actions, stating it had "abjectly surrendered" its employee's rights. The case has sparked public outrage and raised serious questions about the broadcaster's independence and support for its diverse staff.</p>
