          <p>Cambodia has launched its first direct air shipments of durian to China, establishing a new air corridor for fresh fruit between the two nations. An initial two-tonne shipment arrived in China's Henan province, marking durian as the fifth Cambodian fresh fruit approved for direct import into the Chinese market. This development, part of what some call 'durian diplomacy,' highlights growing agricultural trade and customs efficiency between the countries. However, some industry insiders express caution regarding the commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians compared to established suppliers.</p>

          <p>In a significant collaboration with the Trump administration, Mexico has extradited 26 prominent cartel members to the United States to face justice. The group includes leaders from powerful organizations like 'Los Cuinis' and figures linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, wanted for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. This action represents a milestone in the U.S. Justice Department's priority to dismantle dangerous drug cartels. The transfer proceeded after the U.S. agreed not to seek the death penalty, marking the second major extradition of cartel figures in recent months.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of suspended science research grants at UCLA, vacating the National Science Foundation's freeze on over a third of the $584 million in affected funding. U.S. District Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the suspensions violated her previous injunction against terminating such grants. The administration had frozen the funds citing allegations of antisemitism and discrimination at the university. This ruling marks a significant development in the legal battle, although it does not affect suspended grants from other agencies like the NIH.</p>

The launch from Cape Canaveral marks a major milestone, as the Vulcan is set to replace ULA's legacy Atlas V and retired Delta rockets. This mission, designated USSF-106, was the first to be certified by the Space Force for carrying high-value national security payloads. The Vulcan rocket utilizes American-made BE-4 engines, ending ULA's reliance on Russian engines for military and NASA launches.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is forecast to strengthen, potentially becoming the first hurricane of the Atlantic season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding, and is moving westward. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, early models project it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-normal hurricane season for the Atlantic this year.</p>

          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unexpected and unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. The bid comes as Google faces potential divestiture of Chrome following a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling that found the company holds an illegal monopoly in internet search. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated the move would benefit the public and support the open web. However, some industry investors have labeled the offer a 'stunt,' suggesting Chrome's true value is significantly higher and questioning if it is even for sale.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will add questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use to the car and motorcycle driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the 2.4 million learner drivers who take the test each year with basic life-saving skills, as drivers are often the first to arrive at the scene of an emergency. Learning materials have already been updated to include information on how to perform CPR and use a public access defibrillator, which could significantly improve survival rates for cardiac arrest.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers rookie receiver Ladd McConkey is now able to learn directly from veteran Keenan Allen, whose practice film he studied extensively before Allen's return to the team. McConkey, who surpassed Allen's rookie records, is taking every opportunity to gain knowledge from one of the league's premier route runners. Offensive coordinator Greg Roman noted that Allen's presence creates flexibility and strengthens the offense. The two receivers participated in their first full 11-on-11 session together, with both expected to be versatile and key components of the offensive scheme.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted the boil water notice for the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch neighborhoods, ending a weeklong water service disruption. The issue, which affected about 9,200 households, was caused by a faulty, 57-year-old valve that became stuck in a nearly closed position. After a complex repair process, water flow was restored, and subsequent tests confirmed its safety. The DWP is advising residents to flush their pipes and is offering a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France used 'repressive violence' in Cameroon during the nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost 'tens of thousands of lives.' This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France, which detailed how French colonial troops used mass displacement and supported brutal militias to suppress the independence movement. The acknowledgement is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history in Africa.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market surged on Tuesday, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs after a new report indicated that inflation was slightly lower than economists had anticipated. The consumer price index for July showed a 2.7% increase from the previous year, a figure that has bolstered hopes for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. This positive market reaction comes despite ongoing concerns about the potential economic impact of tariffs and a recent, weaker-than-expected jobs report. (not investment advice)</p>
