          <p>Actor-director Ben Stiller has produced a documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," offering an intimate look at the lives of his parents, the famed comedy duo Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film delves into the complexities of their 62-year marriage, which was often intertwined with their professional act, creating tension between their public personas and private lives. Utilizing newly discovered audio recordings his father secretly made, Stiller uncovers raw conversations about his mother's struggles with alcohol and her unfulfilled dream of being a serious actress. The documentary also serves as a self-examination for Stiller, who reflects on his own challenges as a father and husband.</p>

          <p>Four years after the Taliban's return to power effectively banned women's sports, the Afghanistan women's refugee football team is set to compete internationally again in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series. The newly formed squad, comprised of players now living in Australia, the UK, Portugal, and Italy, will play against Chad, Libya, and the UAE. For the players, the tournament represents more than just a game; it is an opportunity to represent Afghan women who have been silenced and stripped of their basic human rights. Defender Najma Arefi described it as a significant responsibility to be a voice for those left behind.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of intense fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes, which were the most severe since the Taliban regained power in 2021, were fueled by Islamabad's accusations that the Taliban harbors armed groups that attack Pakistan. Under the new deal, the Taliban has agreed not to support such groups, and both sides will refrain from targeting security forces and civilians.</p>

          <h2>Taiwan Reports No Major Chinese Military Activity Following President Lai's Policy Speech</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 10:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan's defense ministry has observed no significant increase in Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) activities near the island in the week following a major policy speech by President William Lai. According to Taiwanese figures, the PLA conducted between seven and 27 sorties per day, a level consistent with routine activity rather than a large-scale exercise. This relative calm contrasts with previous instances where Beijing responded to perceived provocations with massive military drills. For example, a large-scale exercise in April involved 76 sorties as a stated "serious warning" to what Beijing considers pro-independence forces.</p>

          <p>An American woman who moved from Texas to Spain ten years ago reflects on the aspects of life in the U.S. she no longer misses. In her article, she highlights key differences, including Spain's generous paid time off, which contrasts sharply with the limited vacation days and work-centric culture she experienced in America. Other points include the reduced dependency on cars due to walkable cities and reliable public transport, affordable and accessible healthcare, and a greater sense of public safety. She also notes less tipping guilt, less extreme political polarization, and reduced societal pressure to follow a traditional life timeline.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to generate 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy industry by 2030, aiming to double the sector's workforce. The strategy identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers, electricians, and welders, to support the expansion of renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear energy. To facilitate this, the plan includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges" and launching new programs to match military veterans and ex-offenders with careers in the sector. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the initiative is crucial for lowering energy bills long-term and creating well-paid, secure jobs in industrial heartlands.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Praises Federal Judges for Blocking Trump's Planned Troop Deployments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article commends two federal district court judges in Portland and Chicago for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to their cities. The author argues that the judges courageously challenged the president's justifications, with one labeling the rationale as "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The piece contrasts this judicial independence with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to Trump. It frames the rulings as a crucial defense of constitutional law over martial law and a vital check on executive overreach in a time of political tension.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential VAT Cut on Energy Bills to Address Cost-of-Living Crisis</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. While declining to speculate on specific fiscal measures, Miliband acknowledged the severe "cost-of-living crisis" and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax reduction comes as the government faces pressure to lower energy costs, which recently rose by 2% for millions under the latest price cap. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household approximately £86 per year, though it would cost the Treasury an estimated £2.5 billion annually.</p>

Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China could maintain an annual growth rate between 4.5% and 5% for the next five years. Zhu believes this sustained growth will establish a solid foundation for the country to meet its 2035 goal of achieving "socialist modernization." His optimistic forecast comes as Chinese leaders prepare for a key party meeting to finalize the next five-year plan, which will set economic priorities amidst ongoing rivalry with the United States.

          <p>A Chinese robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has experienced a significant increase in orders, which it attributes to U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of new tariffs. A company source reported receiving over 1,000 new orders in the past week from clients making emergency purchases to avoid potential price hikes on intelligent drive modules for humanoid robots. The company's factories are now working overtime to ship products before the proposed November 1 tariff deadline. The source humorously thanked Trump for acting as a "sales consultant," noting the surge in demand is much larger than what was seen during previous tariff threats.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of pickleball has been accompanied by a significant increase in eye injuries, according to a new study in JAMA Ophthalmology. Researchers estimate that such injuries, including corneal abrasions and lacerations, have risen by approximately 405 cases annually from 2021 to 2024, with adults over 50 being the most affected group. The study's authors call for the development of standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. Experts suggest that many players are unaware of the risks posed by the fast-paced nature of the game on a small court.</p>
