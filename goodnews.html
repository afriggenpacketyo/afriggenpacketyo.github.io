          <p>Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting House representative for Washington, D.C., initially stated her intention to run for re-election, but her office later walked back the comment. A spokesperson indicated that Norton, who is 88 years old, is still discussing the decision with family and advisors. This back-and-forth mirrors a similar incident earlier in the month, where Norton expressed her desire to run before her office clarified that a final decision was pending. Norton has served as the D.C. delegate in the House since 1991, participating in committees and legislative debates but lacking the ability to vote on bills in the full House.</p>

          <p>Congressman Ro Khanna is calling on the Democratic Party to reclaim its identity as the anti-war party, particularly in the wake of recent U.S. military actions in Iran. Khanna argues that the Democratic Party's foreign policy, including support for Israel's war in Gaza, has alienated young voters. He believes that opposing wars and focusing on domestic job creation is both morally correct and politically advantageous, and he has partnered with Republican congressman Thomas Massie to sponsor a war powers resolution requiring congressional approval for military action against Iran. Khanna contends that most Americans oppose foreign wars and increased defense spending, favoring instead investments in their communities.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges faced by volunteer emergency medical services (EMS) in small U.S. towns. With an aging volunteer base and fewer young people signing up, these agencies are struggling to maintain adequate staffing. Factors such as the higher cost of living and a declining rural population contribute to the problem. Experts suggest that paying volunteers for their time could be a solution to attract and retain more individuals, ensuring the continued provision of essential emergency services in these communities.</p>

The YU7 comes with advanced driver-assist software powered by Nvidia's Thor chip, and pre-sales have already exceeded 200,000 orders within three minutes of launch.</p>

This decision comes after Kennedy's earlier appointments of vaccine critics to the panel raised concerns about the future of immunization policy.

          <p>London's West End production of Evita, playing at the Palladium theater, has gained attention for its unique staging. During Act Two, Rachel Zegler, who plays Eva Per√≥n, performs "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" on a balcony, with the music piped outside and the performance livestreamed into the theater. This has attracted large crowds outside the theater, drawing comparisons to the real Per√≥n's appeal to the masses. The production's unconventional approach is characteristic of director Jamie Lloyd and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who sought to involve the public in the show.</p>
