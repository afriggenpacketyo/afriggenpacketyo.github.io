          <h2>FDA Approves China-Invented Non-Opioid Painkiller Aiming to Reduce Fentanyl Overdoses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 07:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved Qamzova, a non-opioid painkiller invented in China, as a potential alternative to addictive opioids like fentanyl. Developed by Delova, Qamzova is a long-acting injectable analgesic providing 24-hour pain relief with a single daily injection. Clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. This approval marks a significant milestone for China's pharmaceutical industry and offers healthcare professionals a tool to mitigate opioid dependency risks in the US, directly addressing the fentanyl-fueled overdose epidemic. The medication contains a high concentration of meloxicam, a compound commonly used to reduce pain and inflammation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, resulting in a typical gas and electricity bill decreasing by ¬£11 a month starting in July. Ofgem advises households to shop around for fixed energy deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually, as fixed deals may offer better value than the variable tariffs affected by the price cap. The drop reflects a decrease in international wholesale gas prices, but energy bills remain high, with many customers still struggling with costs. The regulator is also considering changes to standing charges, which cover the cost of connecting to an energy supply.</p>
