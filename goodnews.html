Additionally, South Korea will purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products and has agreed to open its markets further to American goods, including vehicles and agricultural products.

          <p>Following a major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article provides a detailed explanation of the science behind tsunamis and how to stay safe. It outlines the key ingredients for tsunami generation, such as an underwater earthquake of at least magnitude 6.5 and significant vertical movement of the seafloor. The text describes how these waves travel at high speeds in deep water and become dangerous as they approach shallow coastlines. Experts stress the importance of immediately heading to higher ground upon receiving a warning, as the waves are powerful and often arrive in a series.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered surprisingly abundant communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Researchers observed and filmed extensive fields of clams, tube worms, and bacterial mats, challenging long-held beliefs about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are not fueled by sunlight but by chemicals like hydrogen sulfide and methane seeping from the Earth's crust, suggesting that such chemosynthetic communities may be more widespread in the deep ocean than previously thought.</p>

          <h2>Debate Continues Over Scientific Evidence of Screen Time's Effect on Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 19:44:30 EDT</div>

          <p>This article delves into the ongoing and complex debate about the impact of screen time on children's developing brains, contrasting widespread parental anxiety with the views of some scientists. While many fear negative consequences for mental health, behavior, and sleep, a group of UK academics argues that the scientific evidence for these harms is weak and often flawed. They point out that much of the research relies on unreliable self-reporting and fails to distinguish between different types of screen engagement, leaving parents with conflicting information and no clear guidance.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, adopting a continued "wait-and-see" approach due to economic uncertainty and elevated inflation. While noting the economy remains in good shape, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted concerns over the potential impact of tariffs on consumer prices. The decision was not unanimous, with two Fed Governors dissenting in favor of a rate cut, marking a rare public division within the rate-setting committee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, a significant turnaround from the 0.5% contraction in the first three months of the year. However, economists note that this headline figure is skewed and overstates the economy's underlying strength, as it was primarily driven by a sharp drop in imports following the implementation of new tariffs. A closer look at the data reveals that domestic demand and consumer spending are weakening, suggesting a slowdown in core economic activity despite the positive top-line number.

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Massive Russia Earthquake Resulted in Minimal Tsunami Damage</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded, the recent 8.8 magnitude temblor off Russia's coast caused surprisingly little tsunami damage across the Pacific. Scientists explain that the quake's energy was primarily directed into a vast, open stretch of ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing the waves to dissipate significantly before reaching populated areas. This favorable directionality, along with other factors, created a best-case scenario that prevented a potential catastrophe and left coastlines like California's largely unscathed.</p>

          <p>This article explores a growing trend in television where audiences are increasingly drawn to anxiety-inducing shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" over more traditional "comfort TV." These series often employ hyperrealistic, high-pressure narratives that unfold in real-time, creating a visceral sense of tension for the viewer. Experts suggest this style of storytelling resonates because it mirrors the stresses of modern work and life, providing a form of catharsis and reflecting a cultural desire for programming that feels authentic and grounded in reality.</p>

This public offering follows the collapse of a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe in 2023, which was abandoned due to regulatory opposition, leaving Figma to pursue an independent path to the public market.
