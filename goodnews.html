          <p>Moscow held its Victory Day parade, marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany, showcasing military hardware and personnel. The event aimed to instill national pride and impress allies, with attendees including foreign dignitaries and military personnel from allied nations. Despite the display of strength, the parade highlighted Russia's ongoing difficulties in the war in Ukraine, with some participants soon returning to the front lines. The parade also served as a public relations stunt to strengthen alliances and attract potential partners to counter Western isolation efforts.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan revealed that approximately 39% of people experience feelings of loneliness, a figure that has remained relatively consistent since 2021. The study also explored the correlation between smartphone usage and loneliness, indicating that individuals who use smartphones for more than eight hours a day are more likely to report feeling lonely. Bereavement of a family member was the most frequently cited factor contributing to loneliness, with other common reasons including living alone and serious health issues. The government is implementing measures to address isolation through regional groups involving public and private sector organizations.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere after being stranded in orbit for 53 years due to a rocket malfunction. The spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a heat shield, is predicted to re-enter on Friday or Saturday, though the exact location remains unknown. Experts estimate the spacecraft will largely disintegrate upon impact, posing a low risk of injuries on the ground. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia, according to international space law.</p>

          <p>A dump truck crashed into the back of the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, colliding with five vehicles and causing a power outage in the surrounding area. No injuries were reported, and the cause of the accident is under investigation. The crash brought down a main wire, initially affecting 1,420 customers, which was later reduced to 225 after crews rerouted power. The incident occurred before scheduled performances at the venue, and representatives for the Whisky a Go Go could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods, suggesting that an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators. The conciliatory tone follows previous announcements of tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, which prompted retaliatory levies from China. Investors are hoping for a resolution to the trade war, with analysts suggesting that tariffs may be cut further following the Geneva negotiations.</p>

          <p>Elton John and Dua Lipa, along with over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists, are urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill to protect their work from artificial intelligence. They seek transparency from developers regarding the use of their material to train AI models. They argue that failing to provide this protection would essentially mean 'giving away' their work to tech firms, potentially harming the UK's creative industries. A government spokesperson said they are consulting on measures to balance the needs of creative industries and AI companies.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The quarantine, effective through Oct. 31, warns against eating non-commercially harvested mussels along the California coastline. These toxins accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms, and cooking does not reliably eliminate them. The quarantine does not apply to commercially grown mussels from certified companies, which are regularly tested for toxins.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration, which alleged she engaged in activities supporting Hamas. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, aside from an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Ozturk's lawyers argued she was targeted for her political speech, and her detention led to concerns about her health and well-being.</p>

Google stated that it does not admit any wrongdoing and that the settlement covers old claims related to product policies that have already been changed.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from ICE detention after a federal judge cited concerns about her First Amendment rights. The judge, William Sessions, said her continued detention could chill the speech of non-citizens. Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student, was detained for 45 days after co-authoring an opinion article critical of Israel. The government's lawyer presented little evidence other than the op-ed, leading the judge to conclude her detention was based solely on her expression. Ozturk reported poor conditions and limited access to medical care during her detention.</p>
