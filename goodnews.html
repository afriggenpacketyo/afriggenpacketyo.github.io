          <p>This New York Times article examines the reaction of Black South Africans to President Trump's claims of genocide against white farmers in their country. Many Black South Africans find humor in Trump's statements, viewing them as detached from the realities of inequality and violence they face. They see Trump's narrative as ignoring their own experiences of hardship and injustice stemming from the legacy of apartheid. Some express anger and disbelief at the idea of Afrikaners being cast as victims, given their historical role in the oppressive system. The article highlights the complex racial dynamics in South Africa and the disconnect between Trump's rhetoric and the lived experiences of many of its citizens.</p>

With extreme weather events causing significant damage in China, responding decisively to climate change is an act of national resilience. While tariffs and protectionism fuel division, the momentum of the green transition can drive progress, as clean energy and climate-smart investments offer economic opportunities. China, already a leader in renewable energy deployment, has the chance to push the frontier of international investment.</p>
