          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, The Octagon is one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes, with a rich history and a reputation for being haunted. The house temporarily served as the executive mansion for President James Madison after the White House was burned in 1814, and it was where he signed the treaty ending the War of 1812. The building's past includes housing enslaved people in its basement and later serving as a school and tenement housing. Now a museum, it is known for paranormal occurrences, such as flickering lights and unexplained alarms, adding a layer of mystery to its historical significance.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agriculture specialists successfully intercepted a new, potentially dangerous pest for the first time in the nation's history. The insect, a leafhopper species identified as Osbornellus salsus, was discovered during a routine inspection of a radicchio shipment from Mexico at the Port of San Luis, Arizona. Leafhoppers are known to damage plants by feeding on sap and can transmit diseases. Following the discovery, the entire shipment was contained and sent back to Mexico, preventing a potential infestation and highlighting the role of agricultural inspections in protecting U.S. ecosystems.</p>

The Kangaroos demonstrated superior quality, particularly in the second half, extending their long-standing dominance in the rivalry. Full-back Reece Walsh was the standout player, scoring a spectacular try that set the tone for the match. Despite a hard-fought effort, England struggled to break down the Australian defense.

          <p>Catherine Connolly, a left-wing independent lawmaker, is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded the election. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly for the largely ceremonial role. A former barrister, Connolly has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and was backed by several left-leaning parties, including Sinn Féin. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms, becoming Ireland's third female president.</p>

Glenn, who was in third place after the short program, delivered a strong free skate to finish with a total score of 214.78.

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying broad market index ETFs, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing favor among some investors. Financial experts note that clients are increasingly seeking better diversification, which is becoming difficult as the S&P 500 becomes heavily weighted towards the technology sector, now over 35% of the index. In response, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500 over the past six months.

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic robot that mimics a jellyfish, designed for covert underwater surveillance and environmental monitoring. Described as an 'underwater phantom,' the drone is made of a transparent hydrogel material, operates nearly silently, and has very low power consumption. Its lifelike design and stealth capabilities make it suitable for observing fragile marine ecosystems without disturbance, inspecting underwater structures, and potentially for deep-sea military reconnaissance. The compact device weighs only 56 grams and measures 120mm in diameter.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and licensed therapist advises parents on how to say 'no' to their children in a way that builds connection rather than conflict. The key is to turn the boundary into a teachable moment by explaining the reasoning behind the limit, particularly for safety and kindness. Offering children control through limited choices can also empower them and increase cooperation. Consistency is crucial, as it helps children learn to trust and expect boundaries, creating a sense of safety and predictability even when they are upset with the rules.</p>

Starting in 2008 while unemployed, he began by flipping items on eBay and eventually built Technsports, a wholesale business that now brings in $6.5 million in annual revenue. The company buys used clothing in bulk and sells it to other professional resellers, who then list the items individually. Senko's story illustrates how identifying a market inefficiency and applying relentless work ethic can turn a small-scale operation into a highly profitable venture.</p>

Liautaud, who built his company from a single shop into a multi-billion dollar brand, emphasized that founders must be 'grinders' who are prepared to work 24/7.

          <p>Two-time Olympic soccer gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending all of their children's sports practices, arguing that their absence can foster greater success. She suggests that without a parent watching from the sidelines, children are more likely to develop internal motivation, resilience, and a willingness to take risks without fear of judgment. This autonomy helps them become self-starters, a key trait for success in adulthood. Wambach recommends that when parents do attend games, they should focus on praising acts of leadership and good sportsmanship rather than on performance or the final score.</p>
