          <p>Elon Musk has announced the end of his time as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's departure comes as his 130-day appointment limit nears its end, a limit imposed on special government employees, and he has been critical of Trump's recent budget bill. Musk has stated that the DOGE mission will continue to strengthen throughout the government, even with his exit from the administration. The White House will begin Musk's off-boarding process, marking the end of his official role in the administration.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is closing its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) office, known as the Institute Community and Equity Office (ICEO), following a comprehensive assessment that began nearly 18 months ago. MIT President Sally Kornbluth emphasized that the university's success depends on attracting talented people from every background and ensuring everyone feels welcome and supported. The decision to eliminate the ICEO and the role of vice president for equity and inclusion comes after MIT scrapped diversity pledges in its hiring and admissions processes. The university spokesperson denied any correlation between ongoing political disputes involving Harvard and the ICEO's demise.</p>

          <p>With negotiations to end the war in Ukraine faltering, the Trump administration is focusing on the Middle East, seeking to broker deals and fulfill President Trump's promise to be a global peacemaker. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced a potential temporary truce in Gaza, which could lead to a peaceful resolution. U.S. officials believe the terms of the new proposal for ensuring talks continue after an initial hostage release and ceasefire would appeal to both parties. Trump has also taken a harsher stance towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, advising against striking Iranian nuclear facilities, as the administration aims to broker a nuclear agreement with Iran.</p>

His departure follows criticism of Trump's budget, which Musk believes will increase the federal deficit and undermine DOGE's work. Musk's exit marks the end of a period where he served as one of Trump's closest advisors, but also saw declining profits at his electric car company, Tesla.</p>

          <p>Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the Democratic Party for the People in Japan, has drawn criticism for referring to the government's rice stockpiles as "animal feed." Tamaki's comment refers to reserve rice from 2021 that the government plans to release to the public to curb soaring prices nationwide. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi has pledged to make the stockpiled rice available in stores at a low price, but Tamaki's remark has been deemed insensitive. Rice prices in Japan have hit a new record in April, marking a significant increase from the previous year.</p>

          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided strong guidance, but the market response was muted due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Revenue in its fiscal 2026 first quarter rose 8% year over year to $9.83 billion, topping expectations, and adjusted earnings per share beat consensus estimates. The company is seeing progress on AI, with the combined annual recurring revenue for Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeding $1 billion. Salesforce also announced its acquisition of Informatica, which is expected to strengthen Data Cloud and its overall AI strategy, but the benefits are not expected to be fully realized until 2027.
