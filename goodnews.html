A cover story featured a glaciologist and his artist daughter documenting the impact of climate change on Washington's North Cascade Mountains. Other segments included interviews with actors known for their iconic TV commercial roles, such as Flo from Progressive, and a profile on artist Rashid Johnson, whose career is the focus of a new exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum.

          <p>Newcastle United has officially signed 24-year-old midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa in a deal worth £40 million. Ramsey, an England Under-21 international who had been with Villa since childhood, has agreed to a five-year contract with the Magpies. Newcastle boss Eddie Howe praised Ramsey's versatility, energy, and Premier League experience as valuable additions to the squad. The move is seen as a significant step for Ramsey, who was drawn by the opportunity to develop further under Howe, following the path of other players who achieved full international status at the club.</p>

The Originals had set a target of 172, anchored by an unbeaten 64 from captain Jos Buttler and a late surge from Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 50 not out.

          <p>Air Canada announced plans to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which had stranded over 100,000 travelers. The government ordered the striking workers back to their jobs and referred the contract dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration. While the airline expects to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the Canadian Union of Public Employees stated that its demonstrations will continue. The union criticized the government's intervention, demanding a fairly negotiated contract rather than an imposed one.</p>

          <p>Following a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin, a U.S. special envoy announced that Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5. This collective defense-style protection, a key Ukrainian demand, was described as a "game-changing" concession and a potential workaround to Russia's long-standing opposition to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the development, stating the EU is ready to contribute. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the prospect important but noted that the practical details of implementation remain unclear.</p>

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara, the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, has successfully performed the country's first-ever spine surgery at Connaught Hospital. He is now responsible for the neurosurgical needs of the entire nation of eight million people, a burden previously unmet within the country. The establishment of this new medical service was made possible through a grassroots network of global health professionals and non-profits, including Mission Brain, which arranged for Dr. Kamara's specialized training and helped procure essential equipment. This milestone represents a significant step forward for healthcare in Sierra Leone, offering new hope to patients with severe neurological injuries.</p>

          <p>Several European and NATO leaders have announced they will accompany Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to his upcoming White House meeting with President Trump. The move is widely seen as a strong show of solidarity and an effort to present a unified front in peace negotiations following Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin. Leaders including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte will be present. The coordinated trip underscores Europe's determination to have a significant voice in any potential peace deal brokered by the U.S. for the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>Crystal Palace Goal Disallowed Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Defensive Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule infringement. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from the Chelsea defensive wall when the kick was taken. According to Law 13 of the game, which was introduced in the 2019-20 season, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance from a wall formed by three or more defenders. The rule was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers positioning themselves within the wall.</p>
