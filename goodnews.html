          <h2>Chinese Researchers Observe Quantum Friction Effect for the First Time in Graphene</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe the phenomenon of quantum friction between solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered that friction did not increase with thickness and, in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. This counterintuitive effect is attributed to how bending the material alters electron movement, restricting energy loss as heat. The breakthrough, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanodevices and advanced quantum materials.</p>

          <p>Princeton, a city north of Dallas, Texas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the nation by the Census Bureau, experiencing explosive population growth. The city's population surged from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 in 2023, driven by affordable housing compared to the surrounding county. This rapid expansion has created significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines and roads to catch up. With 13,000 more homes already approved, Princeton is projected to reach a population of 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams, age 45, lost her second-round match at the DC Open, ending her attempt to secure her first back-to-back tour-level wins since 2019. She was defeated 6-2, 6-2 by Magdalena Frech of Poland. Earlier in the tournament, Williams had become the oldest woman to win a WTA singles match since 2004 with her first-round victory. This tournament marked her return to the sport after a significant hiatus due to surgery for uterine fibroids. Despite the loss, she received a standing ovation from the crowd for her performance and enduring presence in the sport.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council chairman has announced an amended stadium agreement with the Washington Commanders, moving forward despite President Trump's threats to block any deal unless the team reverts to its former name. The proposal, which would bring the NFL team back to a new stadium at the RFK site, is set for a council vote on August 1. The chairman characterized the president's comments as a distraction. The amended deal reportedly includes $950 million in revenue benefits for the district and aims to create jobs and investment in the city, with widespread support from local politicians and residents.</p>

          <p>When automated systems at U.S. Postal Service facilities cannot read an address due to poor handwriting, the mail is not returned to sender but instead digitally sent to a specialized center in Salt Lake City. At this Remote Encoding Center, hundreds of expert "keyers" work around the clock to decipher millions of images of illegible addresses every day. These data conversion operators can process about 900 pieces of mail per hour, ensuring that even the most difficult-to-read letters and packages reach their intended destinations.

          <p>Four traders convicted in the Libor rate-rigging scandal are now seeking to have their convictions overturned. Their appeal follows a landmark Supreme Court decision that quashed the convictions of two other traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo. All were prosecuted for manipulating the Libor interest rate, a key benchmark for inter-bank loans that was central to the 2008 financial crisis. With the new legal precedent set by the Supreme Court, the four traders' appeal is expected to be a more straightforward process. The Serious Fraud Office has declined to comment on the new appeals.</p>

Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are engaging with non-traditional and ideologically diverse outlets, such as podcasts popular with conservative or younger audiences. This shift in media strategy is seen as a course correction after the 2024 loss, aiming to reach new voters. Some candidates are also adopting more centrist rhetoric on cultural issues like gender identity, indicating a broader effort to recalibrate the party's message for the next election cycle.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that major technology companies are not overspending but are, in fact, underspending on artificial intelligence. He characterized the AI race as a "winner-take-all" situation where significant investment is essential for victory and future market dominance. Citing Google's increased capital expenditures as a necessary move, Cramer dismissed skepticism about the profitability of AI investments. He acknowledged current flaws in AI chatbots but predicted they will improve as companies invest in more advanced technology. (not investment advice)</p>

While natural colors can be more expensive and present challenges in stability and shelf life, major food brands are pledging to reformulate their products to comply with new health-focused regulations.</p>
