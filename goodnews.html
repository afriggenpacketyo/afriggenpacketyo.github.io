        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court issued a significant ruling, determining that a state law from 1849 does not function as a ban on abortion. This decision effectively preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state. The ruling addresses the long-standing legal ambiguity surrounding the pre-Civil War statute, which had been a point of contention in the post-Roe v. Wade legal landscape. The court's interpretation ensures that, for the time being, abortion remains legal in Wisconsin, marking a pivotal moment for reproductive rights in the region.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively working to refresh its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on acquiring a new center-forward and up to two creative midfielders. The club has pursued RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko, though a deal has proven difficult, leading them to explore other options like Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres and Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. Additionally, Arsenal is considering wingers such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze to add more flair. The club's transfer activities, led by sporting director Andrea Berta, will likely require a significant financial outlay and may involve selling an established player.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Ana, California, has created a $100,000 emergency fund to support families impacted by recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. Proposed by Mayor Valerie Amezcua, the fund aims to help with essential needs like rent and food when a family's primary earner is detained. The move follows community outcry over the city's initial response to the immigration crackdown. After a heated debate, the City Council approved the fund by redirecting money from city-sponsored cultural events, providing immediate relief to the heavily impacted Latino community.</p>

          <p>A new musical subgenre, dubbed "toddler techno," is gaining popularity by mixing classic children's songs with electronic dance beats, leading to sold-out "baby raves" for children and their parents. Australian DJ Lenny Pearce, a former boy band member, is at the forefront of this trend, creating music that appeals to both generations. While some critics question the appropriateness of rave culture for kids, proponents and some experts note the events can be a positive bonding experience. The events are designed to be child-safe, with controlled volume levels and sensory support, offering a unique way for families to enjoy music together.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is proposing to restore a portion of Tulare Lake, a vast body of water in the San Joaquin Valley drained for agriculture over a century ago. The plan involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a reservoir and wetlands, which would provide a vital outlet for floodwaters and revive crucial wildlife habitat. Supporters, including the Tachi Yokut Tribe, see it as a historic opportunity for cultural restoration and a practical solution for water management and flood protection. The ambitious project faces significant hurdles, including securing funding and landowner cooperation.</p>

Fogerty also touches on his decades-long legal battle over his song rights, which prevented him from performing the hits for years.

          <p>This article analyzes the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, arguing that his proposals are less radical than critics claim. Policies such as a rent freeze, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been implemented or tested in other jurisdictions with some success. For example, rent freezes have occurred previously in NYC, and fare-free bus pilots in other cities have boosted ridership. The piece suggests Mamdani's agenda is not about a complete government takeover but about using tested, targeted interventions to make government work better and improve residents' quality of life.</p>

          <p>The Shandong, China's first indigenously constructed aircraft carrier, has become a key instrument of Beijing's expanding naval power. As the second carrier in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, its deployment represents a significant step in China's ambition to project force beyond its immediate coastal waters and into the wider Pacific. With a displacement of 70,000 tonnes, the Shandong's operations, primarily in the South China Sea, demonstrate China's progress in developing a blue-water navy. The carrier's recent port call in Hong Kong further showcases its role in China's military and diplomatic strategy.</p>

He will replace Elliot Daly, who was ruled out after fracturing his arm in a recent match. The decision is notable as Farrell has not played for England in nearly two years, having taken a break after the 2023 World Cup.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research using continuous glucose monitors on people without diabetes has identified a pattern where blood sugar plummets a few hours after a meal, which scientists call a "dip." These dips are linked to increased hunger, higher calorie consumption throughout the day, and feelings of fatigue and low alertness. Nutrition experts suggest that individuals can manage these fluctuations by not eating carbohydrates alone, instead pairing them with protein, fat, and fiber. Spreading carbohydrate intake throughout the day and eating them last during a meal can also help stabilize blood sugar levels.</p>
