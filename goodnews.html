          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has formed in the Atlantic Ocean southeast of Bermuda, becoming the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Located about 405 miles south-southeast of Bermuda with 40 mph winds, Fernand is moving north and is forecast to strengthen over the weekend, potentially becoming a hurricane by Monday before weakening. The storm is expected to remain over open ocean, moving well east of Bermuda. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar area earlier this month, as NOAA predicts an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms.</p>

          <p>British number one tennis player Jack Draper has revealed he has been struggling with a bruised humerus bone in his serving arm for several months, which troubled him at Wimbledon. Despite the painful injury, the 23-year-old expressed readiness for the US Open, where he reached the semi-finals last year. Draper pulled out of two key ATP tournaments to recover, emphasizing the injury could become 'very, very serious' if he continued playing without rest. He views his recent mixed doubles participation at Flushing Meadows as ideal preparation, confident he won't hold back in his first-round singles match.</p>

Manager Mikel Arteta praised the teenager's maturity, stability, and hunger, noting his unprecedented confidence at such a young age. With potential injuries to key Arsenal players, Dowman could see more opportunities, building on a season where he scored 19 goals and provided five assists for the Under-18s.</p>

Mamdani, who won the Democratic nomination, maintains a strong polling advantage, with his campaign emphasizing grassroots support and a platform including rent freezes, free public services, and higher taxes on universities. Despite his anti-billionaire stance, a large donation from Elizabeth Simons, daughter of a late hedge fund billionaire, was revealed. The incumbent mayor, Eric Adams, and Republican Curtis Sliwa face increasing pressure to withdraw as the November election approaches.</p>

          <p>Beirut's historic Hamra Street is experiencing a cultural revival with the reopening of Le Colisee cinema as the Lebanese National Theater, defying Lebanon's deep divisions. Once a vibrant cultural hub, Hamra declined after the civil war and recent economic collapse, but civil society initiatives are bringing it back to life. The theater's founder, Kassem Istanbouli, aims to connect people through shared cultural spaces, decentralizing art and preserving identity. This effort comes as Lebanon faces new political tensions over Hezbollah's disarmament, yet the district's resilience symbolizes a persistent belief in the country's future despite ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying funding to Los Angeles and 30 other 'sanctuary' cities and counties. The ruling expands previous restrictions, citing the unconstitutionality of Trump's executive order that sought to cut funding to jurisdictions limiting cooperation with federal immigration agencies. The Justice Department, however, stated its intention to appeal, arguing that sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and endanger citizens. These policies typically restrict local resources for federal immigration enforcement, but do not prevent enforcement of judicial warrants, highlighting an ongoing legal battle over federal and local authority.</p>

          <p>Francesca McGhie, the 22-year-old Scottish winger, delivered a stunning hat-trick of tries in her Women's Rugby World Cup debut, leading Scotland to a dominant victory over Wales. McGhie, who only took up rugby at 15 after a background in ballet and contemporary dance, has quickly become a key player for Scotland. Her performance has drawn widespread praise from coaches and former players, with head coach Bryan Easson calling her a 'world-class finisher.' This exceptional start positions Scotland favorably in Pool B, with strong prospects for reaching the knockout stages if they continue their impressive form.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is at the forefront of global efforts to save species from extinction, housing over 20 threatened species on its 32,000-acre Northern Virginia campus. Scientists at the institute study reproduction, ecology, and genetics, aiming to reintroduce animals like the Przewalski's horse and black-footed ferret back into their natural habitats. Despite the success in growing populations, conservation biologists express concern over the alarming rate of species disappearance, which can have cascading effects on entire ecosystems. The SCBI's work, including caring for 60 ferret kits to be released, underscores the critical role of every animal in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is quickly winning over supporters after leading the team to a 2-0 victory over Manchester City, marking consecutive wins and clean sheets. Frank's impressive start comes amid fan discontent over the club's transfer window activity and chairman Daniel Levy. Despite limited new signings, Frank's tactical approach, emphasizing solid defense and attacking freedom, has transformed the team's performance, contrasting with their previous season's negative goal difference. Midfielder Joao Palhinha, a new loan signing, delivered a player-of-the-match performance, crediting Frank's vision for his return to the Premier League and immediate impact.</p>

          <p>The Ukraine war is profoundly altering geopolitical dynamics in former Soviet states, evident in a US-mediated peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, traditionally within Russia's sphere of influence. US President Donald Trump's direct involvement in securing a corridor agreement highlights Russia's waning regional power, despite official Russian statements welcoming the peace deal. Tensions between Russia and Azerbaijan have also risen following a plane crash incident and diplomatic disputes. Countries like Azerbaijan and Central Asian states are increasingly pursuing multi-vector foreign policies, seeking new alliances and leveraging Russia's preoccupation, with China also quietly expanding its influence by guaranteeing sovereignty and security.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience a return of 30C heat on bank holiday Monday, marking one of the hottest summers on record, before the remnants of Hurricane Erin bring unsettled weather. Large crowds are expected at events like Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals, enjoying warm and sunny conditions. However, travel disruptions are anticipated due to rail strikes and engineering works. This short burst of warmth will be followed by cooler, unsettled weather from Tuesday as Erin's tropical air pushes towards the British Isles, bringing persistent rain for the remainder of the week. The prolonged dry periods this summer have already led to hosepipe bans and concerns for the agricultural sector.</p>

Eze expressed his gratitude to Crystal Palace fans in an emotional social media post, acknowledging their support throughout his career. This move significantly strengthens Arsenal's attacking options for the upcoming season.</p>
