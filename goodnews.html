          <p>Hadi Matar, the man convicted of attempting to murder Salman Rushdie in 2022, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The attack at the Chautauqua Institution left Rushdie with severe injuries, including blindness in one eye. Matar, who was found guilty of attempted murder and assault, made a statement in court calling Rushdie a hypocrite, before receiving his sentence. The judge determined the 25-year sentence was necessary to prevent Matar from committing future attacks. </p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that certain college majors in the humanities and healthcare are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. Majors like nutrition, art history, and philosophy have lower unemployment rates compared to computer science and computer engineering. This shift is attributed to the rising demand for creative thinking and soft skills in the age of artificial intelligence, as well as the continued high demand for jobs in the healthcare sector.
