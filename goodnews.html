        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) has maintained its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, continuing a pause since May, citing concerns about household debt and monitoring stability in the housing market. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and follows the introduction of stricter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. The BOK acknowledges a stable inflation rate and an improving economic growth outlook but warns of uncertainties due to ongoing trade talks with the U.S., particularly the potential impact of U.S. tariffs on exports. While household debt remains a significant concern, Bank of America analysts anticipate a potential rate cut by the BOK in November to bolster economic growth, especially if trade talks progress.

          <p>New York City's mayoral contenders, Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa, engaged in a heated televised debate, addressing issues from ICE raids to homelessness and housing. Cuomo and Mamdani sparred over Trump's potential preference in the election, while Sliwa positioned himself as an outsider. Questions arose regarding Mamdani's support for Jewish New Yorkers, with accusations of stoking hatred. The candidates also clashed on topics like rent control, zoning reforms, and the future of Rikers Island, highlighting their contrasting visions for the city. The optimism score is based on the relatively stable tone and the fact that the article is about a debate. </p>

          <p>The New Jersey attorney general has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the company discriminated against thousands of pregnant employees and staffers with disabilities in its New Jersey facilities. The state's investigation revealed that Amazon allegedly placed these workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and retaliated against them for requesting accommodations. Amazon denies these accusations, claiming it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and doesn't have fixed quotas. The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages, civil fines, and court orders to adjust Amazon's policies and subject the company to monitoring. The optimism score is based on the relatively stable tone and the fact that the article is about a lawsuit. </p>

          <p>A former Chinese government policy adviser has encouraged China to challenge Western "double standards" by breaking free from "discourse traps" on issues like state subsidies, democracy, and the global order. The adviser suggested that China should be confident in defending the party's rule and its achievements, but cautioned against intense resistance and fighting back when confronted with Western provocations. This approach risks a backlash among Global South countries, highlighting the need for a more nuanced strategy in international relations. The tone of the article is neutral. </p>

          <p>Early voter turnout in California's Proposition 50 special election, concerning the redrawing of congressional districts, has exceeded expectations. Governor Gavin Newsom noted the extraordinary number of early votes, with Democrats outpacing Republicans and unaffiliated voters. This election aims to counter Republican attempts to maintain control of Congress, with the proposed districts drafted by a Democratic strategist.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are conducting a clinical trial targeting breast cancer "sleeper cells" to prevent recurrence. The team identifies and attacks cells that break away from the main tumor and can resurface later, spreading cancer throughout the body. In a trial with 51 women, only two experienced cancer recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. The next steps involve larger trials to confirm these findings and explore applicability to other cancers. The tone of the article is positive. </p>

          <p>Menopause screening will be incorporated into NHS health checks in England, starting next year. Women undergoing these checks, offered every five years to adults aged 40 to 74, will be asked about menopause symptoms.

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's promise to cut energy bills by £300 is facing scrutiny, with the expert behind the savings estimate suggesting rising electricity costs could negate the projected savings. The estimate, based on a 2023 report by energy think tank Ember, needs to be updated to account for changes in offshore wind costs and other factors. The Tony Blair Institute is calling for a shift from clean power to cheaper electricity, suggesting carbon taxes on gas should be axed. Miliband's department insists it is committed to lowering bills and is already implementing policies to deliver cheaper power. (not investment advice)</p>
