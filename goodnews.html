          <p>European stock markets experienced a slight increase on Thursday, navigating a week marked by significant fluctuations. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index saw a minor rise, though major bourses like the UK's FTSE and Germany's DAX traded lower in early hours. Market sentiment has been influenced by various factors, including political developments in France regarding pension reform and new data showing meager 0.1% economic growth for the UK in August. This mixed performance reflects ongoing uncertainty among investors across the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, surged to a new record high, driven by positive economic news and optimism surrounding international trade.

Gains were led by major electronics and automotive companies, including Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor, reflecting strong investor confidence in the nation's key export sectors.

          <p>The latest episode of the reality show 'The Celebrity Traitors' captured viewer attention with a mix of lighthearted humor and contentious gameplay. Veteran actress Celia Imrie created a viral moment with an ill-timed fart, which she candidly admitted to, sparking laughter among the cast. However, the mood shifted with the banishment of YouTuber Niko Omilana, who was revealed to be a 'faithful'. His elimination led to backlash from fans, who speculated that he was targeted for being an outsider in the celebrity world rather than for strategic reasons.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Research Suggests Women May Require More Sleep Than Men</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emerging research indicates that women may have a biological need for more sleep compared to men, often requiring an additional 20 minutes per night. This difference is attributed to hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle, which can affect sleep quality and duration. Beyond biology, social factors such as the disproportionate burden of domestic labor and non-traditional work shifts also contribute to women accumulating a greater 'sleep debt'. The article combines scientific findings with personal anecdotes to explore the multifaceted reasons behind this gender-based sleep gap.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a remarkable 39.1% increase in its third-quarter profit, surpassing market estimates and setting a new company record. The surge is primarily attributed to the booming demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Buoyed by this strong performance, TSMC has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. The results solidify the company's dominant position in the global semiconductor industry and its role as a key beneficiary of the AI technology trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl has officially dropped out of the running to become the new head coach of Scottish football club Rangers.
