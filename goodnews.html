          <p>Peloton reported an unexpected profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected sales. Despite the positive earnings, the connected fitness company announced a new restructuring plan that includes laying off 6% of its staff to reduce expenses by an additional $100 million. New CEO Peter Stern outlined a strategy focused on returning to growth through micro-stores, expanding the preowned market, and diversifying beyond its core bike and treadmill products. The company's full-year forecast aligns with Wall Street expectations, signaling a potential path to revenue growth.</p>

          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has indicated that a 90-day extension of the current tariff truce between the United States and China is likely. This statement is the most definitive signal from the U.S. administration about the potential for continued de-escalation in the trade dispute. The current truce is set to expire soon, and an extension would provide more time for negotiators to work towards a longer-term agreement. The comments came as a new set of broader U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries took effect.</p>

The rocket and lunar lander manufacturer priced its initial public offering at $45, which was above its already increased expected range, raising $868 million. The successful IPO reflects growing investor enthusiasm for the space technology sector, which has seen increased funding and major government contracts.

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have fallen to their lowest average since May, reaching 8.13%. This decline, coupled with the high likelihood of upcoming Federal Reserve rate cuts, presents a potentially advantageous moment for homeowners to consider this form of borrowing. Compared to alternatives like fixed-rate home equity loans, which won't benefit from future rate drops, and high-interest credit cards, a HELOC currently stands out as a more affordable option. The variable rate, however, means borrowers should be confident in the direction of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, slightly reducing the predicted number of storms but still anticipating an above-normal season. The new outlook projects 13 to 18 named storms, with five to nine potentially becoming hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. Forecasters attribute the expected heightened activity to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and weak wind shear. This updated forecast serves as a continued call for communities in storm-prone regions to remain prepared for an active season.</p>

          <p>In light of President Trump's unpredictable tariff policies, market strategists are offering advice on how investors can navigate the resulting market volatility. While long-term investors are generally advised to stay the course, tactical opportunities may exist for those willing to adjust their portfolios. Some analysts suggest using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to target specific sectors, noting that areas like cryptocurrency and nuclear energy may be less directly affected. Conversely, sectors like consumer discretionary and industrials are seen as more exposed to the negative impacts of the trade disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has surged to become the front-runner to be the next Fed chair, according to prediction market Kalshi, with his probability crossing 50%. This spike followed reports that President Trump's advisors favor Waller's openness to adjusting monetary policy based on forecasts rather than just current data. Waller, a Trump nominee to the Fed board, recently dissented on the decision to hold rates steady, arguing the approach was overly cautious. He has overtaken previous favorites Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett in the speculative market. (not investment advice)</p>
