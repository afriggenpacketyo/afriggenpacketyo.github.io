        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conan O'Brien and Ryan Reynolds playfully mocked Meghan Markle's entry into the jam industry on O'Brien's podcast, likening it to Reynolds' father's former role as a food broker. The comedians joked about the luxury jams being made from the 'oils of Montecito,' referencing Markle's new lifestyle brand, As Ever. This follows criticism of Markle's venture as inauthentic, with PR experts noting the brand lacks the relatability or aspiration found in successful lifestyle brands like Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray. The experts say that authenticity is critical for marketability, which Markle needs to succeed in the lifestyle industry.</p>

          <p>Kenton Cool, a 51-year-old British mountain guide, has achieved a record-breaking 19th ascent of Mount Everest, surpassing his own previous record for the most climbs by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool's mountaineering career includes climbs almost every year since 2004, except for cancellations due to the 2014 avalanche and the 2015 earthquake, as well as the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Kami Rita, a Nepali Sherpa guide, holds the overall record with 30 ascents and is expected to climb again soon, while hundreds of climbers aim to summit Everest during the spring climbing season before weather conditions worsen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study in Bangladesh reveals that a simple change in brick stacking methods could significantly reduce air pollution from traditional kilns. By stacking bricks in a zig-zag pattern to improve airflow and ensuring consistent coal delivery, kilns can operate more efficiently and reduce fuel use by approximately 23 percent. This intervention not only lowers carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions but also improves worker conditions and increases profits for kiln owners. Researchers are now collaborating with the Bangladeshi government to expand this training and implement these low-cost interventions across the country.</p>

          <p>CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, is expanding into clean energy technologies, including mobile EV charging robots, to diversify its business ahead of its Hong Kong IPO.

Its Shanghai-based unit, CharGo, plans to deploy thousands of charging robots globally, targeting markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe by 2026. The company's IPO could raise as much as HK$41 billion, and while EV batteries remain its largest revenue source, energy storage systems are a growing segment.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts Europe's revitalized sleeper train network, driven by climate consciousness and high-speed rail investments, with America's car-centric culture and underfunded public transport. He argues that America's focus on cars and niche transportation projects neglects the potential of trains for community, connection, and environmental sustainability. While Europe values and invests in rail infrastructure, the US lags behind, prioritizing individual freedom over collective and ecological benefits. The author urges America to rediscover and rebuild its railways, offering a more sustainable and connected future.</p>
