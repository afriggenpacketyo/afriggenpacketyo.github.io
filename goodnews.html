        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lending experts suggest homeowners consider home equity loans and HELOCs as cost-effective borrowing options due to lower interest rates compared to credit cards and personal loans. They advise locking in promotional rates for short-term needs like home upgrades that add immediate value, comparing multiple lenders to find low or no-fee deals, and prioritizing high-ROI home improvements. Experts also suggest that setting up a HELOC now could be beneficial, even without immediate needs, as a flexible financial safety net, and to weigh the advantages and drawbacks of HELOCs and home equity loans. Using home equity responsibly can be valuable for consolidating debt, funding high-return investments, or improving monthly cash flow (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to review a challenge to Maryland's ban on assault weapons, preserving a lower court's decision that upheld the law. The ban, enacted after the Sandy Hook shooting, prohibits the possession, sale, or transfer of certain semiautomatic rifles and copycat weapons. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented from the decision. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ruled that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned because they fall outside the scope of the Second Amendment. This decision maintains the status quo in Maryland and nine other states with similar restrictions.</p>

          <p>In 2013, Stephen Curry's move to Under Armour over Nike marked a pivotal moment, largely influenced by his teammate Kent Bazemore. Under Armour strategically targeted Bazemore, overwhelming him with attention and products, which piqued Curry's interest. A botched Nike presentation, where executives mispronounced Curry's name and used a recycled slide deck, further solidified his decision to join Under Armour. Curry's partnership with Under Armour has evolved, with the creation of the Curry Brand and his appointment as president, although the brand has experienced ups and downs. Despite challenges, Curry's relationship with Under Armour has reshaped his approach to off-court business ventures.</p>

Online banks often offer more competitive rates compared to traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. Short-term CDs, such as six-month to one-year terms, currently offer higher interest rates due to the inverted yield curve, making them an attractive option.

Resumed orders could be viewed by Beijing as leverage in broader trade talks.

          <p>A certified financial planner notes that the most common financial mistake young adults in their 20s make is increasing their lifestyle expenses in proportion to, or even beyond, their income increases. Many young adults tend to make lifestyle changes, such as buying new cars or renting nicer apartments, as soon as they receive their first paycheck or a promotion. This behavior can hinder their ability to save, especially for retirement. The expert suggests maintaining a consistent standard of living, or only slightly increasing it, to prioritize saving for the future. (not investment advice)</p>
