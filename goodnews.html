          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher as investors monitor a high-stakes meeting in Washington. European leaders, including those from Germany, France, and the UK, are joining Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to discuss a potential peace deal with U.S. President Trump. The talks follow Trump's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, where reports emerged of a Russian proposal to end the war in exchange for territory. Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, influenced by geopolitical developments and hopes for a resolution to the long-standing conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a group of 30 to 50 critically ill or injured children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This government-coordinated operation, involving multiple departments, marks the first official UK evacuation of its kind during the conflict. The children, selected by the World Health Organization, will travel with family members and receive care from the NHS. The initiative follows calls from a cross-party group of MPs to provide urgent medical assistance to children affected by the decimated healthcare system in Gaza.</p>

Major indices in Japan, mainland China, and India advanced, with China's CSI 300 reaching a 10-month high. The discussions in Washington are being closely watched for any progress toward a ceasefire deal, following a previous U.S.-Russia summit that concluded without one.

          <p>A special U.S. envoy has revealed a significant development from the recent U.S.-Russia summit, stating that Vladimir Putin agreed to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine security guarantees similar to NATO's Article 5. This "game-changing" concession would provide Ukraine with collective defense protection, a key demand that has been a major obstacle in peace negotiations. The envoy, Steve Witkoff, described this as a major shift in Russia's position, potentially paving the way for a comprehensive peace deal to end the war. The specifics of how such a guarantee would work are now a central topic for discussion.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Composite Index surged to its highest level in a decade, reflecting strong investor confidence and a shift of capital into the stock market. The benchmark index climbed 1.2 percent, driven by investors seeking higher returns compared to low yields on government bonds and deposit rates. This rally has occurred despite recent official data indicating a weakening in China's economic growth momentum. Analysts suggest that the rotation from bonds and bank deposits into equities is likely to continue, fueled by hopes for more government stimulus measures to support the economy.

          <p>European leaders gathering in Washington for talks on Ukraine have been strategically working to build personal rapport with an unpredictable President Trump. This diplomatic effort is seen as crucial for moments like today's high-stakes meeting, where they aim to present a united front with President Zelenskyy. Having learned from a tense previous encounter, leaders from the UK, Finland, and Italy have used various approaches, from state visits to shared political alignments, to get on Trump's right side. Their primary goal is to understand the details of his discussions with Putin and ensure any peace deal includes robust, long-term security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, many of which originate from internet culture and Gen Z slang. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, and "delulu," a shortened form of delusional. Other additions reflect modern life, such as "tradwife," describing women who embrace traditional gender roles on social media, and "mouse jiggler," a tool for feigning activity while working remotely. The update highlights the significant and rapid influence of online trends on the evolution of the English language.</p>

          <h2>Dame Helen Mirren Argues James Bond Character Should Remain Male</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed actress Dame Helen Mirren has stated her belief that the iconic role of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, Mirren argued that changing the character's gender would fundamentally alter the franchise into "something else." Her comments align with those of former Bond actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his support for a male actor to take on the role next. The discussion comes as Amazon MGM Studios prepares for the 26th film in the series, promising a fresh take while honoring the character's legacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of "pan-Africanism" is gaining momentum across the Caribbean, as people increasingly seek to reconnect with their African heritage through culture, travel, and economic partnerships. This renewed interest is visible in the rising popularity of African food, music like Afrobeats, and tourism to the continent. The movement is also being formalized at a governmental level, with leaders calling for stronger air, sea, and trade links, and even a shared digital currency to reduce barriers. This modern resurgence, amplified by social media, is seen as a more comprehensive effort to unify people of African descent across the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship after Scotland's Robert MacIntyre, who held a four-shot overnight lead, struggled in the final round. MacIntyre had a difficult start with consecutive bogeys and finished with a three-over-par 73, expressing immense frustration with his performance. Scheffler capitalized on the opportunity, sealing his win with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole to finish two strokes clear. The victory marks another significant title for Scheffler, while a disappointed MacIntyre was left to analyze what went wrong on the final day.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This strong performance is attributed to the successful rollout of new innovative drugs and increased revenue from technology licensing agreements. Analysts predict Hengrui's net profit could rise by as much as 40 percent. The growth reflects a strategic shift for these companies away from generic drugs toward more profitable, novel treatments, which is improving their overall revenue structure and market position.
