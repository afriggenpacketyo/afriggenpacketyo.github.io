          <p>Taylor Frankie Paul, the star of "Secret Lives of Mormon Wives" and the newly announced "Bachelorette," is contemplating how she will approach the show's intimate fantasy suite dates given her Mormon upbringing. In a podcast interview, Paul acknowledged the importance of physical chemistry in a marriage but expressed feeling it would be "disrespectful" to be intimate with more than one contestant. She discussed the "taboo" nature of sex in her religious background and the guilt associated with it, suggesting she may handle the situation with discretion like previous show leads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has confirmed that the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law" will be introduced to Parliament, including a crucial "duty of candour" that legally requires public officials to be truthful during disaster investigations. This landmark legislation, championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, aims to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen in tragedies like Hillsborough, the Grenfell Tower fire, and the Post Office scandal. The law will impose criminal sanctions for breaches and provide legal funding for victims, a significant victory for campaigners.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The introduction of the Hillsborough Law marks a pivotal moment in a 36-year struggle for justice by the families of the 97 people who died in the 1989 stadium disaster. The legislation was born from the injustices they faced, including a lack of legal obligation for public authorities to cooperate transparently and an imbalance in legal funding. Drafted after the 2016 inquests finally cleared fans of blame, the law aims to establish a legal "duty of candour" and parity of legal funding to prevent other victims of state-related disasters from enduring a similar torturous journey for truth.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information. The AI model scripts these clips by pulling data from the product catalog, customer reviews, and other web sources, aiming to simplify the shopping experience. While this could help shoppers navigate thousands of reviews, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and unique insights found in individual human comments. The feature may also risk blending marketing language with genuine user feedback without clear distinction.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave jumped nearly 8% after the company revealed a major purchase commitment from Nvidia valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. According to a filing, Nvidia is obligated to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032, a deal that underscores the immense demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, relies heavily on the chipmaker's GPUs to provide services to its clients, including major tech companies like Google and Microsoft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a difficult first quarter, Tesla's stock has rebounded dramatically, rising 85% from its April low to turn positive for the year. The recovery was aided by renewed Wall Street optimism and a recent disclosure that CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares. Despite the surge, the company still faces challenges, including a multi-quarter sales slump due to an aging product line and increased competition. Leadership is attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has announced it will reduce the weighting of large issuers like China and India in its influential GBI-EM Global Diversified emerging-market bond index. The issuer cap will be lowered from 10% to 9% in 2026, a move intended to decrease concentration risk and enhance the index's overall yield. This adjustment will redirect investment flows away from the largest markets, such as Indonesia and Mexico, and toward smaller nations like Thailand, Poland, and South Africa, creating a more balanced regional exposure for investors.

Despite facing increased competition in AI and aggressive regulatory scrutiny, Alphabet's shares are up more than 30% this year, marking a significant milestone two decades after its initial public offering.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, many homeowners wonder if their mortgage rates will fall. The Fed's rate directly influences short-term loans, but its effect on long-term mortgage rates is indirect. Fixed-rate mortgages tend to follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury note, which reflects broader economic conditions and investor sentiment about long-term inflation. While a Fed cut can influence the lending environment, markets have often already priced in the change, meaning homeowners may not see an immediate, significant drop in mortgage costs.

          <p>For homeowners looking to tap into their property's value, several options exist for borrowing funds like $50,000, each with distinct advantages in the current rate environment. A home equity loan offers the predictability of a fixed rate and stable monthly payments, making it easy to budget. Alternatively, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides a flexible, revolving credit line for ongoing or uncertain expenses, though often with a variable rate. Other options include a cash-out refinance, which could secure a lower rate but resets the mortgage term. (not investment advice)</p>
