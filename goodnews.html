          <p>Lee Jae Myung of South Korea's Democratic Party began his five-year presidential term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after imposing martial law. Chinese Premier Li Qiang has urged deepened cooperation with Japan to address challenges posed by U.S. tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an order to double steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%, raising concerns about global trade disruptions. Japan is mourning the death of baseball legend Shigeo Nagashima, and the U.S. has reaffirmed its commitment to the South Korea alliance following Lee's election.</p>

          <p>Former professional boxer Duke Tanner, who was granted clemency by President Trump after serving 16 years for drug trafficking, shared his experiences and views on potential pardons. Tanner emphasized Trump's thorough review process for clemency cases and suggested that any pardon decision would be based on a careful examination of the facts. Tanner also spoke about the series of pardons granted by former President Biden, including to his son Hunter, and noted that it cannot be compared to his own incarceration and subsequent release. Tanner believes Trump's pardons are a means of holding the criminal justice system accountable.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the opposition party leader, has been elected as the new president of South Korea in a snap election following the impeachment of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, defeating conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo, and will be sworn in immediately, skipping the typical transition period. His victory has led to a surge in the country's Kospi index and a modest strengthening of the South Korean won. Analysts anticipate a more left-leaning agenda under Lee's leadership, with key issues including trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies toward China and North Korea.</p>

Scott has been charged with witness intimidation, identity theft, and breach of bail. Morales-Reyes, who does not speak fluent English, suspected Scott of trying to get him in trouble after accusing him of robbery, and his handwriting does not match the letters.</p>
