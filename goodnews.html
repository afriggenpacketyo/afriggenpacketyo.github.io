          <p>Delta Air Lines has reduced its full-year profit forecast for 2025 due to weaker-than-expected demand and an industry-wide surplus of flights. However, the company's shares increased by 10% after it presented a third-quarter outlook that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, signaling a stabilization in travel bookings. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while corporate travel has leveled off, premium cabin sales and revenue from its American Express partnership remain strong, growing 5% and 10% respectively. The airline plans to make surgical capacity cuts after the summer peak to align with current demand patterns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eritrean cyclist Biniam Girmay, who made history in last year's Tour de France by winning three stages and the green jersey, is facing a more difficult competition this year. Despite a strong second-place finish in the opening stage, his performance has been hampered by a knee injury. Girmay, the only African rider in this year's tour, remains a symbol of hope for his continent but has expressed disappointment with the lack of team support in some stages. He remains focused on securing a stage win and competing for the green jersey again, navigating the pressures of his past success.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia briefly reached a market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday, a value exceeding the GDP of several major countries. This milestone highlights intense investor confidence in the future of artificial intelligence, a sector where Nvidia's chips are a critical component. The company's stock has surged despite challenges like US export controls limiting sales to China, from which it absorbed a $4.5 billion impact last quarter. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has become a central player in the AI race, with its success helping to bolster the wider stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, has been safely rescued after being reported missing at sea. He was found on North Solitary Island, an uninhabited island located about seven miles off the coast of Wooli, New South Wales. Deefholts had gone surfing on Wednesday afternoon and failed to return, prompting his family to contact authorities and initiate a large-scale search. His father described the successful rescue as a "one in a million miracle," and the teen is now receiving medical treatment after spending the night alone on the island.</p>

          <p>South African Olympic champion Caster Semenya has won a partial victory in her long-running legal battle against World Athletics' sex eligibility rules. The European Court of Human Rights' Grand Chamber ruled that the Swiss Federal Supreme Court violated her right to a fair hearing in a 2023 appeal. Semenya, who has differences of sexual development (DSD), has been barred from competing in her preferred 800m event due to rules restricting testosterone levels. While the ruling does not immediately overturn the athletic regulations, it is a significant legal milestone for Semenya, who stated the outcome was "great for athletes."</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Potential Impact of Ranked-Choice Voting on California's Political Landscape</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 06:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how implementing ranked-choice voting (RCV) could reshape California's political dynamics, drawing parallels to its use in New York City. Unlike New York's partisan primaries, California's top-two "jungle primary" system could interact with RCV in unique ways. Proponents argue RCV could save money by eliminating runoffs, increase diversity, and discourage negative campaigning. In California, it could potentially alter strategic incentives for candidates and lead to more centrist outcomes through crossover voting, though the exact effects on the state's nonpartisan system remain a subject of debate among political observers.</p>

          <p>AJ McLean of the Backstreet Boys opened up about his long struggle with addiction and his path to sobriety, which he will celebrate for four years this fall. The singer, who once described himself as a "chronic relapser," stated he doesn't believe he has "another relapse" in him, acknowledging he has "dodged more bullets" than he'd like to admit. McLean emphasized that his addiction was a way to cope with low self-esteem and that continuous work on his recovery is essential. He also spoke about the importance of being honest with his two daughters about his past to control the narrative.</p>

          <p>The European Union is advancing plans aimed at "de-risking" its economy from over-reliance on Chinese supply chains. The proposals include tightening trade defenses, encouraging the reshoring of industries, and stockpiling critical materials to regain control over key sectors. While one plan does not explicitly name China, the overall strategy reflects a geopolitical shift to bolster the EU's economic resilience and industrial policy. The move acknowledges the challenges posed by dependencies on China for certain goods, where it holds significant market power or even monopolies.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece highlights the expansion of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) as a rare, positive policy within the recently signed "Big Beautiful Bill." The author praises HSAs as a bipartisan-supported tool that promotes individual responsibility and helps reduce healthcare costs. The new legislation expands HSA eligibility to Americans with Bronze or Catastrophic ACA plans and allows funds to be used for direct primary care memberships. While arguing for further reforms, the author views these changes as a significant and popular step toward giving individuals more control and choice over their healthcare spending.</p>

James Clyburn. Newsom used the platform to position himself as a leader of the resistance to the Trump administration, touting California's legal challenges against it.

          <p>The UK government has decided against implementing a "zonal pricing" system for electricity, which would have set bills based on a consumer's geographic location. Instead, it will focus on reforming the current national pricing system. Proponents, like Octopus Energy CEO Greg Jackson, argued that zonal pricing could lower bills in energy-generating regions like Scotland. However, some major energy firms, such as SSE, warned the plan could deter investment in renewable projects. The decision provides policy clarity after a three-year consultation but leaves unresolved the underlying issues of Great Britain's electricity market structure.</p>
