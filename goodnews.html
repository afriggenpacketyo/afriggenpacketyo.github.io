          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention while his immigration proceedings continue. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk and that his detention was "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, was allegedly held based on omitted details from his green card application and accusations of anti-Israel speech, which Farbiarz deemed insufficient grounds for detention. The Justice Department is likely to appeal the decision, but Farbiarz has denied their request to stay the ruling, meaning it is effective immediately. The judge also stated that there was no evidence of violence or inciting violence on Khalil's part, and therefore he would not order electronic monitoring.</p>

The film tracks Lucy as she navigates her clients' demands and her own stagnant love life. While the film aims to critique the reality of modern dating, the review argues that it falls short, with characters and ideas that are scattershot and unconvincing. The reviewer notes the film's glossy veneer belies an uncertainty, and its tale is ultimately shallow, lacking substantial arguments.</p>
