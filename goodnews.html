          <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a straight woman in a job discrimination suit, rejecting a heightened standard for majority groups in employment discrimination cases. The justices overturned an appeals court's requirement that members of majority groups meet a higher threshold to win such cases. This decision clarifies the legal standards applicable to employment discrimination claims. The ruling ensures that all individuals, regardless of their group affiliation, are subject to the same legal standards in discrimination cases.</p>
