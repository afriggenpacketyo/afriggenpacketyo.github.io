          <h2>Joby Aviation Expands Air Taxi Production Capabilities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 15:25:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joby Aviation is significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities, aiming to launch air taxi service by 2026. The company is initiating production at a new components facility in Dayton, Ohio, and plans to double capacity at its Marina, California, manufacturing hub, which will eventually produce up to 24 aircraft annually. This strategic move, supported by a $500 million deal with Toyota engineers to help ramp up production to 500 annually in Ohio, underscores Joby's commitment to American innovation and job creation. The expansion coincides with the successful flight of its sixth aircraft, reflecting growing investor interest in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 15:09:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the Trump administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume AI chip sales to China is strategic, ensuring China receives only the company's "fourth best" technology. This approach aims to keep Chinese companies reliant on the American "tech stack" while preventing them from developing superior homegrown infrastructure. Nvidia's H20 chip, a modified version of its Hopper-generation chips, will be sold, with Lutnick emphasizing the goal is to keep Chinese developers "addicted" to U.S. technology. This reversal, following a meeting between President Trump and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, is a significant win for Nvidia, which had faced an effective market closure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>MP Materials' stock saw a significant 22% increase following the announcement of a $500 million deal with Apple for rare earth magnets and the establishment of a new recycling facility. This strategic partnership is designed to reinforce Apple's U.S. supply chain for critical components found in advanced technology, from smartphones to electric vehicles, and is expected to generate dozens of new manufacturing and R&D jobs. The agreement includes Apple purchasing magnets from MP Materials' Texas plant and a joint venture on a recycling line in California. This initiative supports the broader U.S. goal of reducing dependence on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, which he stated would impose a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods imported into the U.S., while American exports to Indonesia would be tariff-exempt.

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic panel, depicting an erotic theme, has been successfully repatriated to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii after being stolen by a Nazi German captain during World War II. The artwork, dating from the first century B.C. to the first century A.D., was returned from Germany through diplomatic channels, facilitated by the heirs of its last owner. Experts consider it a work of "extraordinary cultural interest," likely decorating a bedroom floor. The park's director, Gabriel Zuchtriegel, described its return as "healing an open wound," highlighting a significant change in mentality where the possession of stolen art becomes a burden, reinforcing the importance of cultural heritage restitution.</p>
