          <p>McDonald's customers are sharing a secret menu hack online for a drink called "Cotton Candy Sprite." The drink is made by ordering a medium Sprite with three pumps of French vanilla syrup. While some customers are excited to try it, others are skeptical of the flavor combination, with some reporting it tastes more like creme soda and doesn't resemble cotton candy at all. McDonald's has not yet commented on whether they will officially embrace the drink, but this article indicates that the article is not the first time a secret menu item has gone viral.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging "The Central Park Five," an opera about the wrongful conviction of five Black and brown teenagers for the sexual assault of a jogger in Central Park in 1989. The opera, which won the Pulitzer Prize for Music, also features Donald Trump, who at the time took out full-page newspaper ads demanding the death penalty for the teens. The director of the Detroit Opera production chose to focus on the lives of the exonerated men and their journey through trauma, rather than centering on Trump's character.</p>

          <p>Farmers in California's "salad bowl" are investing in housing for H-2A guest workers due to an aging local workforce and increased immigration enforcement. These housing complexes are modern multi-family townhomes with recreational areas and laundry facilities. While some community members are skeptical, citing the need for affordable housing for domestic farmworkers, county leaders see it as a win-win. The article indicates that the number of H-2A visas certified for Monterey County has ballooned since that first grower-funded housing development went up.</p>
