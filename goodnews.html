          <p>Brazilian police arrested two suspects, both Lady Gaga fans, who were allegedly planning an attack on her free concert at Copacabana Beach. The suspects, part of an online group promoting hate speech and violence, were reportedly planning to use improvised explosives, but no explosives were found during the operation. The arrests were part of Operation Fake Monsters, a joint investigation aimed at preempting any threat ahead of the singer's performance, which drew over two million fans. Lady Gaga's team stated they were unaware of the operation until after the concert, which proceeded without incident, and had worked closely with law enforcement during planning and execution, feeling confident in the safety measures in place.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX facility in South Texas, known as Starbase, is on track to becoming an official city after a vote overwhelmingly approved its incorporation. The vote, primarily supported by SpaceX employees, solidifies Musk's influence over the area, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest regarding beach access and launch operations. The city, spanning 1.5 square miles, currently manages roads, utilities, schooling, and medical care for its residents. SpaceX seeks increased launch activity, requiring beach closures, which critics argue should remain under county government control to protect public access.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the renowned value investor. Over six decades, Buffett transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate through his disciplined approach to investing, buying wonderful businesses at fair prices. His success has inspired generations of financiers and earned him a Midas-like fortune, while also making him a trusted advisor to corporate executives and government officials. While Gregory Abel is expected to succeed Buffett, some investors worry that Berkshire may lose its unique status without its chief architect.</p>
