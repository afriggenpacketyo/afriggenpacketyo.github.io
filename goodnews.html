          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which includes imposing a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese goods imported into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through Vietnam from other countries. In exchange, Vietnam has agreed to grant the United States complete, tariff-free access to its markets for American products. This agreement aims to curb the practice of transshipping, where goods from countries like China are routed through Vietnam to avoid higher duties. The deal was finalized shortly before a 90-day pause on many of Trump's broader reciprocal tariffs was set to expire.</p>

          <p>A new expedition is set to travel to Nikumaroro, a remote Pacific island, in an attempt to locate the lost aircraft of famed aviator Amelia Earhart. The effort, organized by the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute, will investigate a "visual anomaly" identified in satellite imagery of the island's lagoon. The team hopes this object is the wreckage of Earhart's Lockheed 10-E Electra, which disappeared 88 years ago during her attempt to circumnavigate the globe. If the plane is identified, it could finally solve one of the 20th century's most enduring mysteries and fulfill Earhart's wish to return the aircraft to Purdue University.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully sequenced the first whole ancient Egyptian genome from the remains of a man who lived as a potter between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago. The study, which analyzed well-preserved DNA from the man's tooth, revealed he had brown eyes, stood 5.2 feet tall, and lived a physically demanding life. Significantly, the genetic analysis showed that about 20% of his ancestry traced back to the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East, providing the first direct genetic evidence of population mixing between North Africa and the Levant during this critical period of Egyptian history. This breakthrough opens new possibilities for understanding the genetic history of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <h2>Stowaway Snake on Australian Domestic Flight Causes Two-Hour Delay</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Brisbane was delayed for two hours after a snake was discovered in the aircraft's cargo hold as passengers were boarding. A professional snake catcher was called to the scene to remove the reptile, which was identified as a harmless 2-foot green tree snake. The snake catcher noted the situation could have been much worse, as he initially thought the snake might be venomous and could have disappeared into the plane's interior. Officials suspect the snake, which is native to the Brisbane area, hitched a ride in a passenger's luggage on the inbound flight.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers currently possess the best record in Major League Baseball, establishing an eight-game lead in their division. This success comes despite a season marked by injuries to key pitchers and uncharacteristic slumps from star players like Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman. Manager Dave Roberts believes the team's best baseball is still ahead, suggesting that as players return from injury and find their rhythm, the team will only improve. The Dodgers' ability to build a significant lead without playing at full strength positions them as a formidable contender as the season progresses toward the playoffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 4-3 decision, the Wisconsin Supreme Court's liberal majority has overturned the state's 1849 law that banned nearly all abortions. The court ruled that the historic ban was superseded by a more recent 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. The 1849 law had been dormant since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision but was argued to be reactivated after Roe was overturned in 2022. This ruling provides legal certainty for abortion providers and patients in Wisconsin, affirming that consensual abortions are not outlawed by the archaic feticide statute and will remain legal in the state under the framework of the 1985 law.</p>

          <h2>Germany Considers Taiwanese Drones to Decrease Reliance on Chinese Technology</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components as it seeks to reduce its dependence on China. A recent report shows Germany has become the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones, a trend driven by security concerns and China's tightening export controls. While a complete decoupling from China's dominant drone market is considered unrealistic, Germany aims to diversify its supply of critical parts like software and sensors. Taiwan is positioning itself to fill this role by developing a "non-red" supply chain free from Chinese influence, which is attractive to European partners.</p>

          <p>After a period of record-breaking heat, a significant shift in weather has brought cooler and more comfortable temperatures across the United Kingdom. Following the hottest day of the year on Tuesday, temperatures have dropped by more than 10¬∞C in some areas. The Met Office does not forecast a return to heatwave conditions in the near future. Instead, the outlook for the next week includes more typical summer temperatures and unsettled conditions, with a weather warning for heavy showers and thunderstorms issued for parts of Scotland and northeast England. The recent heatwave was the second of 2025, a phenomenon scientists link to climate change.</p>
