          <p>President Trump stated on social media that Apple will face a 25% tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. if they are not manufactured domestically, causing Apple's shares to decline in premarket trading. Currently, Apple primarily produces iPhones in China, but has been shifting some production to India due to friendlier trade relations with the U.S. This announcement follows ongoing trade tensions and could significantly impact Apple's manufacturing strategy and costs, potentially affecting consumer prices and the company's profitability.

Gates emphasized the importance of timeliness in philanthropy, driven by a responsibility to address contemporary needs and opportunities, especially as government funding for global aid decreases. He criticized Elon Musk's approach to aid and highlighted the need for billionaires to give more and give faster, inspired by Chuck Feeney's "Giving While Living" ethic.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating selling its headquarters building in Yokohama to help cover costs associated with plant closures and other restructuring initiatives. The struggling automaker may also book an additional 60 billion yen in restructuring costs this fiscal year as it pushes ahead with its revamp plans.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields have eased slightly but remain high as investors evaluate the potential impact of President Trump's tax bill on the economy. The bill, which has passed the House but not the Senate, is projected to add nearly $4 trillion to the fiscal deficit, raising concerns about the sustainability of U.S. debt. Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating has amplified these fears, with analysts suggesting that the large deficit could lead to increased bond supply and potential inflation, making fixed-income investments less attractive.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed that a typical gas and electricity bill will fall by ¬£11 a month from July, but it is urging households to shop around for cheaper energy deals, as switching to a fixed deal could provide better value for many customers. While the price cap will be lower, there are cheaper deals being offered for fixed deals, which usually last a year, by some suppliers. The drop in energy bills in July reflects a fall in the international price of wholesale gas. Prices remain high, and some continue to struggle with the cost of energy.</p>

          <p>Authorities from several countries took down more than 300 servers and issued international arrest warrants for 20 suspects in a global anti-malware crackdown. Some of the world's "most dangerous malware" was disrupted this week in a coordinated international operation, which led to the issuance of 20 arrest warrants, the EU anti-crime bodies Europol and Eurojust said Friday. The operation enabled the countries involved "to take action against the world's most dangerous malware variants and the perpetrators behind them".</p>
