          <p>SpaceX achieved a significant milestone with the successful launch of its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket, marking its 10th test flight after previous catastrophic failures. The 40-story vehicle performed as designed, with the Super Heavy booster completing a controlled splashdown off the Texas Gulf Coast and the Starship upper stage reaching a suborbital trajectory before its planned Indian Ocean splashdown. This critical test advances SpaceX's goal of developing a fully reusable rocket for Starlink deployments and eventual Mars colonization. The success is also vital for NASA, which relies on a modified Starship to land astronauts on the moon as early as 2027, despite ongoing challenges with in-orbit refueling and heat shield perfection.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has decided to revert to its traditional "Old Timer" logo, responding to significant public backlash against its recent modern redesign. The company issued a statement acknowledging customer voices and their love for the classic illustration, a sentiment echoed by former President Donald Trump who publicly advocated for the change. This reversal follows a period of controversy where new restaurant aesthetics and a simplified text-only logo were introduced, leading many to question if the brand was abandoning its established country roots. The company aims to reaffirm its commitment to its core identity of delicious food, warm welcomes, and country hospitality, ensuring beloved elements like Uncle Herschel remain prominent.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is vigorously promoting a message of self-reliance, encouraging citizens and businesses to "Make in India and spend in India," as the Trump administration's steep 50% tariffs on Indian exports commence. This rallying cry, delivered during Independence Day celebrations and reiterated in subsequent public addresses, is a direct response to the anticipated economic impact on the country's diverse export-driven industries. To mitigate the blow and stimulate the economy, Modi's government is pursuing significant fiscal reforms, including a simplification of the Goods & Service Tax (GST) and an income tax cut. These measures are strategically designed to bolster domestic consumption and foster economic resilience amid escalating global geopolitical tensions and adverse trade developments.

          <p>China's endangered golden snub-nosed monkey population in the Shennongjia mountains has experienced a remarkable resurgence, growing from fewer than 500 in the 1980s to over 1,600 today, due to intensive conservation initiatives. Professor Yang Jingyuan, who has dedicated his entire career to understanding and safeguarding this unique sub-species, has cultivated an extraordinary rapport with the monkeys, even interpreting their vocalizations. Early efforts were hampered by extensive logging and hunting driven by impoverished local farmers, but a pivotal shift in public awareness and the successful integration of these farmers as forest protectors proved transformative. This compelling article showcases a significant conservation success story, marked by increased tree cover and ambitious plans to further expand the monkey population beyond 2,000 within the next decade.</p>
