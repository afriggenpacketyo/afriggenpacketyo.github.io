          <p>As the 50th anniversary of "Jaws" is marked, recent shark encounters are grabbing headlines, but experts say it doesn't necessarily indicate a rise in shark populations. Activist Julie Andersen attributes increased sightings to more people in the water, better technology, and shifting ocean conditions. She emphasizes the importance of shark conservation and dispelling myths about these creatures. Despite recent bites, most are minor, and conservation efforts are helping white shark populations rebound in certain areas.</p>

          <p>China has allowed Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet again, after a five-year suspension due to COVID-19 and border tensions, prompting hopes for improved relations.
