          <p>A bill proposed by House Republicans would give newborns $1,000 in ‚ÄúTrump accounts‚Äù to be invested on their behalf in financial markets. Under the bill, children born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which could be withdrawn later for expenses like college or buying a house. The accounts have puzzled tax experts because they function similarly to typical investment accounts rather than tax-advantaged accounts. People could only contribute post-tax income to the accounts, and gains would also be taxed upon withdrawal. </p>

          <p>Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng saw its shares in Hong Kong surge over 10% following upbeat earnings and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. The Guangzhou-based carmaker's first-quarter revenue more than doubled from a year earlier, driven by robust sales. Xpeng said it delivered 94,008 vehicles in the first three months this year, more than four times the sales volume a year earlier. Analysts expect Xpeng will likely turn profitable in the fourth quarter this year, thanks to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government started a revamped gasoline subsidy designed to cut prices by 10 yen ($0.07) per liter to ease cost-of-living pressures for consumers.

The program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could last until the end of March 2026. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election. </p>
