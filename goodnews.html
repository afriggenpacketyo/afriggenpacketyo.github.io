          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, the report also highlights that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP agreed upon in June. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>A controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement was made in an email from the head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management to an interfaith community group that had inquired about providing services. The facility, which has been the subject of lawsuits that halted the intake of new detainees, was a high-profile project supported by President Trump. Its closure comes as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announces plans for a new immigration detention facility in the state called "Deportation Depot."</p>

          <p>Nvidia announced quarterly earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with a forecast for continued sales growth above 50%, signaling sustained high demand for its AI infrastructure products. Despite the strong overall performance, the company's stock declined in extended trading as its data center revenue of $41.1 billion fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirmed Nvidia's central role in the global AI buildout, with the company projecting between $3 and $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade.

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The role, which had been vacant since she took office, is designed to help film and television productions navigate city bureaucracy and streamline the process of shooting in Los Angeles. The delay in filling the position had caused frustration among industry advocates, who viewed it as a critical step to support the local production economy amid a slump and increased competition from other locations. The appointment fulfills a campaign promise aimed at protecting the city's signature industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering working parents in England 30 hours of funded childcare per week for children from nine months old. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the program, which aims to alleviate the high costs of childcare. However, concerns persist about the sector's ability to meet the increased demand, with estimates suggesting a need for 35,000 additional staff and 70,000 new places by September 2025. Providers also worry that government funding rates are insufficient to cover their costs, forcing them to charge extra for essentials.</p>

          <p>A UK charity named Greater Change is finding success with a model that provides direct cash payments to individuals who are homeless or at risk of losing their homes. The organization believes giving people the "dignity of choice" allows them to solve their immediate problems, such as paying for rent deposits or clearing debts, which can prevent a slide into homelessness. The charity reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, arguing the approach saves taxpayer money in the long run. This initiative reflects a growing body of international evidence suggesting that direct cash grants are used responsibly and effectively by recipients.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Jacqueline Wilson has released "Picture Imperfect," an adult sequel to her acclaimed 1999 children's book, "The Illustrated Mum." The new novel revisits the characters Dolphin and Star as adults, exploring their ongoing relationship with their mother, Marigold, who lives with bipolar disorder. Wilson describes the book as both the "easiest and hardest" she has written, as she felt a deep connection to the characters but also a responsibility to portray their lives realistically. She continues her trademark approach of tackling difficult themes like mental illness and family dysfunction, aiming to provide an honest, though not always happy, continuation of the story.</p>

          <p>China has rapidly become the world's largest electric vehicle manufacturer and exporter, a development that is fundamentally altering the global car market. Companies like BYD, which has surpassed Tesla in revenue, are leading this charge, supported by decades of government subsidies, lower labor costs, and a strong battery supply chain. Having already surpassed Japan as the world's top auto exporter in 2023, Chinese EV brands are now aggressively expanding into international markets, particularly in Europe and the UK. This expansion is prompting regulatory scrutiny and tariffs from the U.S. and EU, which are seeking to protect their domestic auto industries from the competitive pressure.

          <p>Following Nvidia's latest strong earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the idea that the market is in an artificial intelligence bubble. He asserted that the massive AI-related spending by major tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google is a worthwhile investment in essential technology, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer acknowledged that while Nvidia's stock dipped slightly after its report, the cause was extremely high expectations rather than a fundamental weakness. He urged investors to trust the judgment of the major tech firms building out their AI capabilities, suggesting their long-term vision will pay off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of the Sino-Japanese War approaches, this article examines China's evolving position in the global system it helped create. Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties as a key Allied power in World War II, Beijing now finds itself frequently cast as a revisionist adversary to the Western-led order. The piece suggests that China's historical sacrifices underpin its determination to uphold and defend global norms, countering the narrative that its growing influence is inherently destabilizing. This perspective frames China not as a challenger, but as a primary guarantor of the post-war international framework.</p>
