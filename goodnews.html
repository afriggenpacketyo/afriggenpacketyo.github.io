          <p>House Republicans are proceeding with a vote this week on a tax bill containing President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border security, and defense spending, but internal GOP divisions persist. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledges more work is needed, with disagreements remaining on the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Conservative holdouts want deeper cuts to clean energy subsidies and Medicaid, while moderates resist Medicaid slashes and demand SALT relief. President Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, which also faces Senate resistance. The inclusion of a debt limit increase adds urgency, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of potential inability to pay bills by August if Congress does not act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL owners are set to discuss a potential ban on the 'tush push' play, with Commanders linebacker Frankie Luvu calling it a 'cheapo play' akin to a rugby scrum. Luvu suggests the play gives an unfair advantage and disrupts defensive cadences. He was penalized three times for jumping over the line of scrimmage during January's NFC Championship game against the Eagles, who heavily rely on the play. The NFL's vote on the ban was previously tabled due to an even split among owners, requiring 24 votes to pass. The Eagles' success with the 'tush push' has made it a point of contention within the league.</p>

          <p>Newark Airport experienced a brief radio system outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control center, marking the fourth such incident since April 28. The FAA is investigating the two-second outage, stating that all aircraft remained safely separated. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said upgrades to the nation's air traffic control system are underway, costing tens of billions of dollars, but the existing system relies on decades-old technology. The Philadelphia air traffic control facility handling Newark flights is also experiencing a staffing shortage, adding to the challenges. More than 90% of the nation's airport towers are inadequately staffed, falling short of standards set by a working group.</p>

The judge stated that the administration's actions to dismantle USIP, including terminating its board members, staff, and dispersing its assets, were unlawful.

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a Wisconsin angler with a family legacy of shipwreck discoveries, has discovered one of the largest tugboats to ever tow on the Great Lakes, scrapped more than a century ago off the shores of Manitowoc. On May 13, Christopher Thuss noticed the wreckage north of the Manitowoc breakwater in Maritime Bay just 9 feet below the water's surface. The wreck was later determined to be the J.C. Ames, a 160-foot tugboat known for towing large schooners. The J.C. Ames is the first major confirmed and released shipwreck discovery this year, according to Brendon Baillod, president of Wiconsin‚Äôs Underwater Archeological Association.</p>
