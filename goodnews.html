          <p>Federal prosecutors have rested their case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at his Florida golf course. The final witness, an FBI agent, presented evidence suggesting Routh had been living at a gas station and conducting surveillance for a month prior to the incident. Investigators detailed Routh's internet searches for high-powered weapons and his alleged motive to prevent Trump from being elected. Routh, who is representing himself in the trial, is expected to call three witnesses for his defense next week.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a deal to keep TikTok operating in the United States is "well on its way" following a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. During his remarks, Trump credited the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, stating that Kirk had been a proponent of using the platform to engage with young voters and had helped Republicans achieve significant gains with that demographic. The proposed deal would see TikTok's U.S. operations divested to a group of American investors, a move intended to address national security concerns while preserving the popular social media app.</p>

          <p>In an interview ahead of London Fashion Week, supermodel David Gandy voiced his concerns about the growing use of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He is part of a group of over 2,000 models calling on the government to regulate generative AI, which can create human-like images for campaigns without using real people. Gandy argues that this trend not only threatens the livelihoods of models but also makes entire creative teams, including photographers, makeup artists, and assistants, redundant. He fears that without regulation, AI could irreparably damage the industry and its artistic ecosystem.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been chosen to create the statue of Queen Elizabeth II for her national memorial, which will be located in St. James's Park in London. Jennings, who has previously sculpted King Charles III, expressed his elation and stated his goal is to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of the late monarch. The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also honor Prince Philip, is expected to be revealed in 2026 after consultation with the Royal Family and other stakeholders. The project aims to create a lasting tribute to Britain's longest-reigning monarch.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 19:03:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's state visit, major U.S. tech companies like Microsoft and Google have announced billions of pounds in new investments in the United Kingdom, particularly in AI infrastructure and research. This article analyzes the growing economic relationship, dubbed a "tech bromance," and its potential to stimulate the UK economy. While the influx of capital is seen as a profound opportunity, some critics, including former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, warn that it could lead to the UK simply importing U.S. technology while exporting its own talent and ideas, rather than fostering homegrown giants.

Upon their arrival, they were greeted by supporters and members of Congress, to whom they presented a version of the U.S. Constitution created by children.

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, characterizing the 85-page filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for being filled with "vituperation and invective" rather than clear legal arguments. However, the dismissal is not final, as the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a shorter, more focused complaint that adheres to legal standards. Trump responded to the news by asserting, "I'm winning, I'm winning the cases," and attacking the reporting of ABC News.</p>

Trump later told reporters that a deal is "well on its way" and that getting it signed could be a "formality." The proposed framework would see the popular video app's U.S. operations divested to American investors to allay national security concerns. The negotiations are ongoing as Trump has repeatedly extended the deadline for ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, to complete the sale.</p>
