          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 14:52:53 EDT</div>

          <p>Intel's stock rose significantly after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. government would take an equity stake in the chipmaker, suggesting a 10% share. This move, if finalized, signals a notable shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the government actively investing in corporate America. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stated the government sought an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funds, emphasizing it would be non-voting. Intel, the sole U.S. company capable of making advanced chips on American soil, is also slowing construction on its Ohio factory, making government investment a crucial development for its future and domestic chip production. The company had already secured a nearly $8 billion grant under the CHIPS and Science Act, and this potential equity deal underscores the government's commitment to bolstering domestic semiconductor manufacturing.

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant rally, particularly in cyclical and economically sensitive sectors, following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium. Powell's remarks, which highlighted growing downside risks in the labor market and a potential need to adjust policy stance, were interpreted by traders as a signal for possible interest rate cuts before year-end. This dovish sentiment led to a surge in stocks like Capital One, DuPont, and Home Depot, while defensive groups lagged. The article also provides updates on Starbucks' potential sale of a stake in its China business to private equity firms and analysts' positive outlook on Honeywell's quantum unit, Quantinuum, ahead of a busy earnings week for tech and retail giants.

The two-day event, scheduled for November 15 and 16 at Dodger Stadium, will feature a diverse array of artists including A$AP Rocky, Childish Gambino, Doechii, Earl Sweatshirt, Thundercat, and 2 Chainz. This eclectic mixture of artists, ranging from hip-hop to indie-pop, ensures a broad appeal for the festival's attendees. The festival, known for combining music with carnival attractions, sold out its tickets quickly after release in May, demonstrating its continued popularity. Tyler, the Creator recently released his ninth studio album, "Don't Tap the Glass," and concluded a world tour for his previous EP, "Chromakopia."</p>

          <h2>"Splitsville" Film Review: A Comedy That Struggles to Find Its Edge</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The film review for "Splitsville" critiques the movie for failing to deliver the cutting comedy it aspires to be, despite its timely release amidst a desire for cinematic entertainment. Directed, co-written, and co-starred by Michael Angelo Covino alongside Kyle Marvin, the film continues their exploration of male friendship and bad choices, often portraying men as vain and infantile. While attempting to satirize modern marriage and bourgeois aspirations, the article suggests the movie is overly self-regarding, centering too much on the leads' antics rather than deeper meaning. Despite strong performances from Adria Arjona and Dakota Johnson, their characters often feel manipulated, and the film's outlandish fight scene highlights its struggle to cohere into a meaningful narrative.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is reportedly close to finalizing new three-year media rights deals with ESPN, NBC Sports, and Netflix for various live game packages, signaling a significant shift in its broadcast strategy. Under the proposed terms, NBC would acquire all of the league's Sunday games and Wild Card playoff games for an estimated $200 million annually, while Netflix would secure rights to the Home Run Derby. ESPN is expected to receive a new package including MLB TV's digital out-of-market games and in-market rights for five local teams, along with a mid-week national game package. These agreements, all ending after the 2028 season, would allow MLB to reorganize its media rights strategically in the future, following ESPN's earlier decision to opt out of its previous $550 million-per-year deal for Sunday Night Baseball.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran native who was wrongly deported in March, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is now en route to his family in Maryland. He was returned to the U.S. in June to face human smuggling charges, which his attorneys argue are "vindictive and selective prosecution" and have sought to dismiss. A federal judge previously ordered his return to Maryland and blocked further deportation, placing him under ICE supervision, ensuring he cannot be immediately removed again. Ábrego García's lawyers accuse the government of charging him because he refused to "acquiesce in the government's violation of his due process rights," maintaining his innocence ahead of his January 2027 trial, which will further examine the circumstances of his case.</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate activists, aged eight to 17, have sued the state of Wisconsin, alleging that its pro-fossil fuel policies violate their constitutional rights, including the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The lawsuit specifically targets two state laws that prohibit the public service commission from considering climate pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from requiring increased carbon-free electricity. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, shared her personal story of forced relocation due to increased flooding, an impact of global heating, which inspired her involvement. The plaintiffs, supported by Our Children’s Trust and Midwest Environmental Advocates, aim to have these laws declared unconstitutional, arguing they impede the state's pledged transition to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050 and harm youth health and safety.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, acknowledging high uncertainty due to "sweeping changes" in tax, trade, and immigration policies. In his Jackson Hole speech, Powell noted shifting risks between full employment and stable prices, despite a resilient labor market. He emphasized the Fed's ability to "proceed carefully" with policy adjustments given current restrictive territory. While not explicitly endorsing a September cut, his remarks sent stocks soaring and Treasury yields tumbling, aligning with market expectations and President Trump's demands for lower rates. Powell reaffirmed the FOMC's commitment to making decisions based solely on data and maintaining Fed independence, despite external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

He plans to name his six wildcards soon and is consulting with vice-captains, assessing players as "player X" even when considering himself. Bradley admits the dual role adds a fresh level of stress, but believes it is "doable" with support, highlighting the unprecedented nature of his situation and the immense personal challenge involved.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada will drop many of its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, a move that comes after a phone call with President Donald Trump. The decision, effective September 1, will end tariffs on goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA), aiming to "re-establish free trade for the vast majority" of goods. However, Canada will maintain its 25% levies on U.S. autos, steel, and aluminum, aligning with the U.S.'s 35% tariffs on non-compliant goods. The White House welcomed the move as "long overdue," as both countries look to accelerate negotiations on these strategic sectors ahead of the USMCA review next year.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack expressed skepticism about lowering interest rates, despite market enthusiasm following Chair Jerome Powell's speech hinting at potential easing. Hammack emphasized that inflation has remained above target for four years, necessitating a "modestly restrictive stance of policy" to bring it under control. She noted her belief that the "neutral" interest rate is higher than most Fed officials perceive, advocating against an accommodative stance that could reignite inflationary pressures. Although not a voting member this year, Hammack's comments highlight a differing perspective within the Fed, suggesting that rate cuts are not a foregone conclusion for all policymakers. This stance contrasts with futures traders' nearly 90% chance prediction for a September cut, underscoring ongoing debate within the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to pay £2.9 million in compensation to over 7,700 Kenyans affected by a 2021 fire caused by a British military training exercise in the Lolldaiga conservancy. This out-of-court settlement follows a lengthy legal battle where claimants reported property loss and health complications from the blaze, which damaged 7,000 acres of private land. While the British High Commission called the fire "extremely regrettable," claimants expressed dissatisfaction with the compensation sums, though their lawyer noted the difficulty of proving cases after four years. The incident highlights ongoing controversies surrounding British military activities and historical land disputes in Kenya, including allegations of other misconduct by soldiers, despite the economic contributions of the British Army Training Unit Kenya.</p>

          <p>Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot are grappling with the impact of President Donald Trump's increasing tariffs, but report that consumer spending remains steady despite rising costs. Retail executives, including Walmart CFO John David Rainey, indicate that while some prices have increased, companies are actively mitigating the effects through diversified sourcing, pushing back on vendors, and expanding discounts. Walmart noted more price adjustments in lower-income households but overall consumer resilience, though some brands like Crocs reported cautious customers and weak retail orders. The article highlights that while tariff costs are accumulating, retailers have largely blunted widespread price hikes so far, with strong brands and new revenue streams like advertising and marketplaces helping to absorb the financial pressures and maintain profit margins.
