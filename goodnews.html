          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, themed "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," showcased celebrities in tailored suits and dramatic gowns, highlighting the influence of the "black dandy" on fashion. Zendaya donned a cream Louis Vuitton suit, while Kim Kardashian opted for an all-black leather ensemble. Demi Moore interpreted the theme literally with a Thom Browne gown resembling a men's tie, and Bad Bunny paid homage to his Puerto Rican heritage with a brown Prada suit. Rihanna debuted her pregnancy with A$AP Rocky in Marc Jacobs, and Diana Ross wore a show-stopping white ensemble with feathers and a long train. Lewis Hamilton and Sydney Sweeney also made memorable appearances, with Hamilton wearing a cream suit by Grace Wales Bonner and Sweeney honoring Kim Novak in Miu Miu.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods, experts believe that Temu and Shein are likely to remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. The companies are adapting by onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on the platforms have been increasing, they are still expected to be competitive compared to other e-commerce sites. The success of Shein and Temu is attributed to their agile supply chains and ability to adapt quickly to consumer trends, allowing them to offer products at competitive prices.

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito, 91, was admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a thorough medical examination after an earlier checkup revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. The Imperial Household Agency reported that the former emperor is not currently experiencing any symptoms related to the condition, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscles. This hospitalization follows a coronary-artery bypass surgery in 2012 and treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately two centuries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times article suggests that President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China casts doubt on the country's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan. The removal of two defense ministers and several senior officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, raises questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. Corruption and political interference within the People‚Äôs Liberation Army are significant issues, potentially weakening China's appetite for war. The article argues that Taiwan and the United States should use this time to strengthen their defenses, recognizing that Xi may be reluctant to risk a military failure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In recent years, a shift has occurred in China, where the children of senior officials are increasingly seeking positions in the public sector, reversing a previous trend of pursuing lucrative business careers. This change is attributed to the ruling Communist Party's tightening of regulations around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption efforts, as well as a slowing economy. Government jobs are now seen as a more secure and stable option, despite being lower-paid and more demanding than private sector roles.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to present a roadmap to eliminate all Russian gas deliveries, both current and future, to the bloc by 2027. This decision follows Russia's aggression against Ukraine, an EU aspirant nation. The EU, once heavily reliant on Russian gas, seeks to enable companies to withdraw from existing contracts, though potential penalties and arbitration challenges exist. Currently, the EU imports approximately 19% of its gas from Russia, a significant decrease from 40% in 2022. Unanimous support among EU members is required for sanctioning imports, but Hungary and Slovakia have opposed the plan.</p>

          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to modernize over 1,000 GP surgeries in England, aiming to expand and upgrade facilities for better patient care. This investment, the largest in five years, is intended to tackle long waiting times and improve access to GP appointments.

The funding is part of broader plans to overhaul the health service and shift care from hospitals to communities.</p>
