          <p>The Buffalo Bills achieved a thrilling 41-40 victory over the Baltimore Ravens in their season opener, staging a massive 22-6 fourth-quarter comeback. Quarterback Josh Allen, the reigning league MVP, led the charge with 394 passing yards, 30 rushing yards, and four total touchdowns. The turning point came when Ravens' Derrick Henry fumbled with minutes left, allowing the Bills to capitalize and narrow the deficit. Kicker Matt Prater then sealed the win with a 32-yard field goal as time expired, capping a memorable and hard-fought contest that lived up to its preseason hype as a rematch of last season's AFC playoffs.</p>

          <p>Japanese markets traded higher after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation, sparking investor optimism for new leadership. The benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.5%, and the Topix climbed to a record high, reflecting excitement around potential contenders like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, a protege of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who is favored for deregulation and growth. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to rise, driven by persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI, a unit of Fitch Solutions, foresee extended uncertainty into Q4 2025, but the market's initial response signals a positive outlook on the leadership transition.

          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in a funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to $280 million. The Shenzhen-based company, less than two years old, focuses on integrating generative AI to enable robots to perform complex tasks autonomously, addressing a long-standing industry challenge. X Square Robot also launched Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, predicting "robotic butlers" within five years, though acknowledging current AI for robots lags behind conversational AI. The startup, already generating revenue from sales to schools and hotels, plans an IPO next year, aiming to reduce robot prices for the consumer market to around $10,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz claimed his second U.S. Open trophy and sixth major title overall, defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in four sets (6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4). The match was notably delayed due to enhanced security measures for President Trump's attendance. Alcaraz, 22, showcased a dominant performance, losing only one set throughout the entire tournament and breaking Sinner's serve five times. This victory marks Alcaraz's return to the world No. 1 ranking and continues his remarkable five-month run, having won 36 of 37 contests and reaching eight consecutive finals, solidifying his rivalry with Sinner.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-US study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly discovered that Mars possesses a solid inner core. This core, approximately 600km in radius, accounts for about 18% of Mars’ radius, a proportion similar to Earth’s inner core. This finding challenges previous assumptions about Mars' internal structure and cooling rate, as most solar system bodies haven't cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core. The discovery could also reignite discussions about whether Earth was the sole planet to have once developed plate tectonics, adding significant insights to planetary science.</p>

Hamas later confirmed receiving ideas from the U.S. through mediators and reiterated its readiness for negotiations to release all hostages in exchange for a clear announcement of an end to the war and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet in Lowestoft, Suffolk, completely unaware she was pregnant.

Robinson reported no unusual symptoms, attributing hip pain to a previous birth. The dramatic arrival, witnessed by family and aided by an off-duty paramedic, occurred during a match dedicated to a deceased "uncle Huggy," leading the couple to name their son Henry James in his memory.</p>

With the Texans threatening late in the game, Landman stripped the ball from a running back, allowing lineman Braden Fiske to recover. This crucial defensive play, alongside cornerback Cobie Durant's interception and multiple sacks, compensated for an offense still finding its rhythm. Quarterback Matthew Stafford passed for over 60,000 career yards, and receiver Puka Nacua showed grit with 10 catches despite an injury, contributing to the Rams' 7-2 record in openers under coach Sean McVay.</p>

          <p>Global investors are reportedly shifting capital away from US equities towards Asian markets, marking a significant diversification trend after a decade of US dominance. This move is driven by Asia's booming artificial intelligence sector, a weakening US dollar, and expectations of more accommodative Federal Reserve policies in 2025-2026, according to Candace Browning of Bank of America. While US equities attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020-2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now evenly allocating between US and international markets. Asia's AI market is projected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, offering compelling opportunities and better valuations compared to expensive US stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the lunar surface, a sight that has astounded humans for millennia. Astrophysicist Ryan Milligan explained that the moon appears red because only sunlight reflected and scattered through Earth's atmosphere reaches it, with blue wavelengths dispersing more easily.
