          <p>Tuesday's UK newspapers are dominated by reactions to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new Brexit trade deal with the EU, which promises to boost the economy but faces criticism for concessions on fishing rights and youth visas. Several papers highlight the UK's joint condemnation with France and Canada of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's actions in Gaza, including restrictions on aid. The Financial Times reports on UBS's use of AI analyst avatars, while other papers focus on Gary Lineker's departure from the BBC. The Daily Mail accuses Starmer of a 'great Brexit betrayal'.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. The company's global expansion comes despite facing trade tensions and scrutiny over alleged links to China's military.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are working through late-night sessions to advance President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill,' facing internal divisions and Democratic opposition. The Budget Committee convened late Sunday to move the tax cut and spending reduction package forward after a previous setback. The article highlights the parliamentary reasons for the unusual timing and the challenges Republicans face in securing enough votes, particularly regarding spending cuts and state and local tax deductions. The process is described as reminiscent of Edward Hopper's 'Nighthawks,' with lawmakers fueled by caffeine as they try to reach a deal.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, appointed by President Trump to lead the Kennedy Center, has alleged financial mismanagement and 'criminal' activity related to the center's debt and deferred maintenance, promising to refer the matter to federal prosecutors.

The season will feature 'The Outsiders' but not 'Hamilton,' and lacks the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, a former staple at the Kennedy Center.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with both the European Union and the United States, showcasing Britain's negotiating agility in the post-Brexit era, yet these agreements required politically difficult concessions, reflecting the country's status as a midsize economy. The deal with the EU will generate nearly ¬£9 billion in benefits annually by 2040, while the US deal lowers tariffs on British luxury cars. However, Britain had to allow European trawlers to fish in its waters for 12 years and grant greater access to American agricultural products.

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, defying challenges from the US-China trade war. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating.

This decision follows earlier moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce deposit rates, protecting their net interest margin.

          <p>U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is considering visiting Japan in late August to attend the Tokyo International Conference on African Development in Yokohama and the World Expo in Osaka. While unlikely to visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings, Guterres plans to deliver a speech highlighting the importance of a world free of nuclear weapons. He may also meet with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and visit Kyoto.</p>
