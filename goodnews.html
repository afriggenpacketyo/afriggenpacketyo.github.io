          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. This extension, formalized by a presidential executive order, maintains the current tariff rates of 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on American goods entering China. The additional time is intended to facilitate further negotiations on resolving trade imbalances, unfair practices, and other economic and national security issues. Despite the truce, trade flows between the two nations have already seen a considerable decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new venture as a founder. His departure comes as GitHub faces intensified competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Replit, which are rapidly gaining market share. Under Dohmke's leadership, GitHub launched the popular Copilot tool and saw its developer base more than double to 150 million. The company has not yet named a successor, and its leadership team will now report to an executive within Microsoft's CoreAI division.</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese economist and central bank adviser, Wang Yiming, has called for a balanced approach to regulating the country's fiercely competitive "quick commerce" market. He argued that instead of stifling competition, the government should guide the sector away from excessive cash burn and zero-sum tactics. Wang emphasized that rapid delivery services create new consumption opportunities that are vital for long-term economic growth. The goal, he suggested, should be to foster a healthier industrial ecosystem through innovation and quality improvements rather than simply curbing competitive practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four individuals suspected in a series of burglaries that targeted several residences, including the Los Feliz home of actor Brad Pitt. The break-in at Pitt's home occurred on June 25 while he was out of the country for a film premiere. According to law enforcement sources, at least three suspects breached the property's security, smashed a window, and ransacked the house, stealing various items of value. The arrests were made in South Los Angeles, and the investigation into the burglary ring is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss the case against Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Trevor Kirk, who was already convicted by a jury for using excessive force. The judge called the government's effort to overturn the conviction "contrary to the public interest" and ordered the deputy to begin his four-month prison sentence. The unusual attempt to erase the prosecution after a guilty verdict had previously triggered resignations from several federal prosecutors. The ruling ensures Kirk will face punishment for the 2023 assault on a woman in Lancaster.</p>

          <p>In Mexico City's Xochimilco canals, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to track the critically endangered axolotl salamander. With the population having plummeted from thousands per square kilometer to just a few dozen, traditional net surveys often come up empty. By filtering water and searching for genetic particles shed by the creatures, researchers can detect their presence without physically capturing them. This innovative technique has confirmed axolotls still exist in protected refuge areas and one unprotected site, offering a small sign of resilience and guiding future conservation efforts to restore their habitat.</p>

          <p>Sheila Jordan, a unique and highly respected jazz vocalist, has passed away at the age of 96. Known for her distinctive style, she was a contemporary of Charlie Parker and recorded the landmark album "Portrait of Sheila" in the 1960s. Despite facing personal hardships and the challenges of being a single mother, her dedication to music never wavered. She became a distinguished educator and experienced a prolific recording career later in life. In 2012, her significant contributions to the genre were recognized when she was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analyst Views Trump's 15% Cut from Chipmakers' China Sales as a Form of Tariff</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 19:16:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Commentator Jim Cramer described the Trump administration's deal with Nvidia and AMD as a novel form of tariff, not an unprecedented government action. The agreement requires the semiconductor giants to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer noted that the revenue goes to the Treasury and compared it to past government interventions, such as the Chrysler bailout. He argued that while the "pay-to-play" element is debatable, the decision to allow the sales is ultimately beneficial for the companies and taxpayers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old Kentucky man wanted in connection with armed robberies was arrested in Montgomery County, Ohio, after being found hiding in a sewer drain. The arrest followed a police chase that began when officers spotted a stolen vehicle, which then crashed. The suspect, Trevor Walker, fled on foot, prompting a large search and a shelter-in-place advisory for the area after firearms were found in the vehicle. A SWAT team eventually located Walker soaked in water inside the drain and convinced him to surrender, bringing a tense situation to a safe conclusion.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's production company, Archewell Productions, has signed a new multi-year deal with Netflix, but the terms are less exclusive than their original 2020 agreement. The new "first-look" deal gives Netflix the first option on their film and television projects, but does not cover overhead costs or grant exclusive rights to all content developed. The partnership has so far produced several successful documentary and reality series, including "Harry & Meghan" and the culinary show "With Love, Meghan." The new deal also encompasses Meghan's lifestyle brand, "As ever."</p>
