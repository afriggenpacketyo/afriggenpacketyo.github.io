          <h2>Etiquette Expert Offers Guidance on Being a Considerate Houseguest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the summer travel season continues, etiquette expert Elaine Swann provides advice on how to be a welcome houseguest. The key is to respect that you are in someone else's space, regardless of your relationship with the host. Best practices include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a reasonable length like four days, and communicating plans clearly to align expectations. Guests should be self-sufficient, avoid relying on their host for transportation, and always clean up after themselves, as being told to "make yourself at home" is not an invitation to be messy or overly demanding.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge, an ambitious project to connect Sicily with the mainland that was first conceived over 50 years ago. The bridge, set to be the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, faces significant challenges, including seismic activity, high winds, and local opposition from residents who believe the funds should be used for existing infrastructure. If successfully completed by its 2032 target, proponents argue the €13.5 billion project could stimulate southern Italy's economy by creating jobs and improving transportation for both vehicles and trains.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a notable surge in tourism from China this summer, with some destinations seeing a year-on-year increase of 13% in the first half of 2025. According to the European Travel Commission (ETC), Chinese travelers are showing a strong willingness to undertake long-haul trips to the continent, surpassing interest from other key markets like the U.S. and Japan. This rebound is providing a significant boost to Europe's travel and hospitality industries. The article suggests this trend may be indirectly influenced by geopolitical factors, as travelers seek out various international destinations.</p>

After an opening-round 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par and positioning him well for his first potential PGA Tour victory. When play was stopped due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were in the clubhouse at nine under. The second round is scheduled to resume on Saturday, with 21 players still needing to complete their rounds.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has died at the age of 97. Lovell is remembered for his calm leadership after an onboard explosion crippled the spacecraft, turning a potential catastrophe into what NASA called one of its "finest hours." He was also a member of the Apollo 8 crew, the first mission to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice.

          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit is unexpectedly returning to rugby union, cutting short his attempt to forge a career in the American NFL. After leaving rugby to join the NFL's International Player Pathway, he signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars but faced a challenging transition. A recent back injury, combined with a coaching staff change and the immense difficulty of breaking into the sport at the highest level, prompted his decision. While his American dream has ended, his return is being hailed as a major boost for Welsh rugby, where he is expected to make an immediate impact.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude is unlikely to derail a potential EU-India free trade agreement. Experts suggest that the larger threat of significant U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, proposed by the Trump administration, could paradoxically push India closer to the EU. As India seeks to diversify its economic partnerships amid global volatility, a stable trade deal with the EU becomes more attractive. This dynamic could benefit the EU's negotiating position and potentially align with its goal of reducing Russia's oil revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in a meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure than common cubic diamonds and is believed to be even harder. Previous attempts by researchers worldwide to synthesize this material, also known as lonsdaleite, typically resulted in impure or mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's success in creating macroscopic crystals provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens possibilities for new ultra-hard applications.</p>
