          <h2>Europe Faces Risk of Becoming a 'Shock Absorber' in US-China Trade Dynamics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are warning that Europe must undergo rapid reforms to avoid becoming a mere 'shock absorber' in the evolving global trade landscape dominated by the US and China. Despite a recent easing of tensions between the superpowers following talks in Geneva, the long-term outlook for Europe remains uncertain without deeper political integration and coordinated fiscal and industrial policies. Michael Pettis of Peking University suggests that without such changes, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others rather than shaping its own outcomes in global trade. The article emphasizes the need for Europe to proactively adapt to maintain its influence in the international arena.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of 7.6% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analyst expectations. While revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, net income missed estimates due to factors like the disposal of subsidiaries and valuation changes in equity investments. Analysts had anticipated that investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce would drive stronger results, but the company is facing challenges from macroeconomic volatility and intense price competition in China. Alibaba is investing in 'instant commerce' and partnerships to boost user engagement, but it continues to navigate a complex economic landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals a trend of lawyers strategically selecting federal jurisdictions to find judges sympathetic to their political views, a practice known as venue shopping. Conservatives often file cases challenging the Biden administration in small Texas courts, while liberals have increasingly turned to courts in Massachusetts to challenge the Trump administration. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should have the power to issue nationwide injunctions that dictate policy for the entire country. Critics argue this erodes confidence in the courts, while others defend it as a necessary tool for advocating for clients.</p>

          <p>The LA 2028 Olympics is planning to introduce an air taxi service for spectators, partnering with Archer Aviation to provide transportation during the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The service aims to offer 10-20 minute flights between select destinations, including major Olympic venues, using electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. However, Archer Aviation is still awaiting certification from the FAA, and the cost of the service remains unclear. The organizers hope the air taxis will transform transportation in Los Angeles and leave a legacy of innovation.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is facing challenges due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems with remote-controlled pop-up devices to reduce rope usage, but the cost is a barrier for many. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect the whales. The situation highlights the need for innovative solutions to balance economic interests with environmental conservation in the fishing industry.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, facilitated by a land bridge that connected the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. The study, published in Science, found that these migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges happening in both directions. The research highlights the interconnectedness of ancient ecosystems and the adaptability of animal populations.</p>

The Trump administration may implement the decision through waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>
