          <p>President Trump is reportedly pursuing a deal with Iran over its nuclear program, aiming to avoid military conflict despite objections from Republican hard-liners and Israeli officials. Negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, are ongoing, with Trump insisting on halting uranium enrichment, a demand Iran has resisted. The Gulf Arab states, previously wary of Iran, are now seeking a negotiated settlement to avoid regional instability. Sanctions relief and guarantees from the U.S. are key sticking points, as Iran seeks assurances that the U.S. will adhere to any new agreement given Trump's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>Celebrities like Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie, and Heidi Klum attended the Cannes Film Festival, showcasing stunning outfits despite a newly implemented dress code banning nudity and excessively voluminous attire. Berry had to alter her original gown due to the train's size, while Jolie impressed in a sequined nude gown. Klum's floral dress, featuring a thigh-high slit and long train, sparked debate over compliance with the new rules. The festival organizers aimed to maintain decency and ensure smooth traffic flow on the red carpet, leading to the enforcement of these guidelines.</p>

          <p>The Swiss city of Basel is hosting the Eurovision Song Contest, with Sweden's comedy trio KAJ being the favorite to win.

          <p>Federal courts have resisted the Trump administration‚Äôs aggressive deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Courts have emphasized that immigrants must have the opportunity to challenge their deportations, especially as the administration claims novel powers to remove them. The courts' stance supports the fundamental principle that all persons are entitled to due process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift sanctions on Syria's transitional government took U.S. sanctions officials by surprise, lacking specifics on which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was aware and part of the decision-making process, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the decision was discussed for weeks leading up to the announcement. Syria's transitional government has pushed for sanctions relief, which could come in the form of waivers to allow aid and business without penalties.</p>
