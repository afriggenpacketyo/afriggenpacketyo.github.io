          <p>A retired FBI agent explained that the FBI's strategy in the Charlie Kirk assassination manhunt, which involved withholding the suspect's name while circulating images, mirrored the approach used during the Boston Marathon bombing investigation. This tactic is intended to generate stronger public tips by focusing attention on confirmed images rather than unverified names. The agent emphasized that withholding a name is crucial until investigators have a positive ID that meets a prosecutable threshold and until all notification steps are handled. Authorities were seeking the public's help in the case. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the National Guard will be deployed to Memphis, Tennessee, to address crime in the city. This decision follows a similar federalization of law enforcement in Washington, D.C. Trump stated that both the governor and mayor of Memphis are in agreement with the plan. He attributed his focus on Memphis to a suggestion from Union Pacific railroad CEO Jim Vena, who described the city as deeply troubled. The President has previously mentioned deploying troops to Chicago, although he has not yet taken action. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth studio album, "Play," marks a shift from heartbreak to happiness, representing a lighter chapter in his life. After his previous album, "Subtract," which chronicled heavy personal struggles, Sheeran wanted to create something that was the polar opposite. He wrote hundreds of songs, selecting tracks that prioritized experimentation over commercial appeal, aiming to create something that made him feel good. The promotional strategy for the album includes surprise pop-up performances rather than traditional media circuits, and Sheeran describes his life as settled, calm, and happy.

          <p>Military experts suggest that China's DF-5C intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) has made significant advancements in fuel storage technology, enabling it to remain in silos for extended periods and launch at any time. Protected rocket nozzles and improvements in fuel storage suggest a leap forward from its predecessor, the DF-5B. Liquid-fuel missiles, like the DF-5C, offer the advantage of carrying larger payloads and heavier warheads compared to solid-fuel missiles. The close-up shots of the DF-5C during a military parade were specifically provided to dispel doubt about China's nuclear deterrence capabilities. The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>
