          <p>British banking giant Barclays has upgraded its full-year financial guidance and announced a surprise £500 million share buyback for investors. The bank now anticipates a return on tangible equity greater than 11% and has increased its net interest income forecast to over £12.6 billion. Despite a 7% year-on-year decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit, which was slightly below expectations, the positive announcements caused the company's shares to rise. The bank's performance was impacted by charges related to the UK's car loan scandal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh has defended the club's process for appointing new head coach Danny Rohl, admitting that while it may have appeared "clunky" externally, it was not mishandled. Cavenagh confirmed the club engaged with multiple candidates simultaneously, including Steven Gerrard and Kevin Muscat, before securing Rohl. He clarified that the final decision was influenced by timing and logistics rather than mismanagement by the club's executives, expressing strong satisfaction with the appointment and emphasizing the focus is now on the coach who joined.</p>

Investors were processing new trade data from Japan, which showed a 4.2% rise in exports for September, snapping four months of declines but still missing analysts' expectations. The market movements followed a record-setting close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the U.S., driven by strong corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly facing significant engineering challenges in the development of its planned 18-inch foldable iPad, potentially pushing its release to 2029 or later. The device, which is part of Apple's push for more innovative products, has encountered issues related to its weight, features, and the complexity of its large foldable display. Prototypes are said to resemble a Mac laptop when closed and open to the size of a 13-inch laptop, but without an external screen. The high cost of the advanced display technology is also a factor, with the device's projected price tag around $3,000.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study has ranked the physical side effects of 30 common antidepressants for the first time, revealing significant differences between the drugs. Researchers from King's College London and the University of Oxford analyzed data from over 58,500 patients, finding wide variations in effects on weight, heart rate, and blood pressure within the first eight weeks of treatment. The findings suggest that antidepressant prescriptions could be better tailored to individual patients based on their existing health conditions. Researchers are developing an online tool to help doctors and patients make more informed decisions.</p>

          <p>The United States and India are reportedly close to finalizing a major trade agreement that could see Washington significantly reduce tariffs on Indian exports. In exchange, New Delhi is considering scaling back its purchases of Russian oil, a move confirmed by U.S. President Donald Trump after a call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. According to Indian media, the deal could lower U.S. tariffs from 50% to around 15-16% and increase India's import quota for American corn. This development marks a potential turning point in trade relations, which had been strained by India's energy partnership with Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's mayoral candidates are preparing for their final debate, with Democrat Zohran Mamdani seeking to maintain his frontrunner status. The race has been intensified by former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, who is pressuring Republican Curtis Sliwa to drop out and consolidate conservative support behind him. Sliwa has forcefully rejected these calls, creating a contentious dynamic among the challengers. Mamdani aims to stay focused on policy issues, while Cuomo sees the debate as a crucial opportunity to present himself as the only viable alternative to the progressive Democrat.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers lost their season opener to the Golden State Warriors 119-109, despite a stellar performance from Luka Dončić. With LeBron James sidelined by injury for the first season opener of his career, Dončić recorded 43 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists in a heavy-lifting effort. However, the Lakers struggled with turnovers and could not overcome a balanced Warriors attack, which saw four players score in double figures, led by Jimmy Butler with 31 points. The Lakers' poor performance in the third quarter proved decisive in the loss.</p>

The addition, which the White House says will cost $250 million and is funded by private donors, is intended to host large official functions.
