          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 15:26:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has issued a new travel ban impacting individuals from 12 countries, marking a revised approach from his initial policy. Legal experts suggest this iteration addresses previous legal vulnerabilities by providing clearer definitions and exemptions. While the original ban faced numerous court challenges, this version appears more legally robust, potentially securing Supreme Court approval if challenged. The key difference lies in the absence of an explicit focus on Muslim-majority nations, which could influence the court's decision. This new ban reflects lessons learned from the past administration's legal battles. Optimism may be tempered by the potential impact on international relations and individual liberties.</p>
