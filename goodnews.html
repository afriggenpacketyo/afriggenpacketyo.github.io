          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing various diseases over the next decade. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to focus on predicting and preventing illnesses, with a significant investment of ¬£650 million allocated for DNA research across all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes that this gene technology will allow the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them, building on previous studies that analyzed the genetic code of approximately 100,000 babies. This program aims to revolutionize healthcare by identifying potential health issues early on, allowing for timely interventions and improved patient outcomes. The goal is to shift from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months due to "foreign policy" concerns under the Trump administration. Upon release, Khalil criticized the administration's actions, while his attorneys emphasized that his detention was unwarranted. A judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, allowing him to return to New York to reunite with his wife and newborn son, whom he had limited access to during his detention. The White House indicated it would appeal the decision, while the Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's order, underscoring the ongoing legal and political battle surrounding Khalil's case. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, preventing the government from cutting off access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard, suggesting the school has acted appropriately during negotiations. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism. Harvard sued, arguing it was being punished for defying the administration's political agenda. The ongoing battle over international students could significantly impact Harvard, where approximately one in four students are from outside the United States. </p>
