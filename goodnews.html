          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that a significant majority (83.7%) of Japanese citizens are worried about the potential impact of the escalating Israel-Iran conflict on their daily lives, primarily due to Japan's reliance on the Middle East for oil. The poll also revealed a decline in public approval for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet, falling to 32.5% from 37.0% the previous week, with disapproval rising to 50.9%. The survey also touched on topics such as tax policy and corporate donations. The poll surveyed 425 household members and 625 mobile phone users.</p>

          <p>Two Japanese nationals have been released from detention in Belarus following a pardon by President Aleksandr Lukashenko, reportedly at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump. The two men, detained in 2020 and 2024, were released on Friday and arrived in neighboring Lithuania. One of the men is believed to be an individual sentenced to 16 years for joining an anti-government protest in Minsk in 2020, and the other a man detained last December for photographing an elevated highway in a southeastern region that borders Ukraine.</p>
