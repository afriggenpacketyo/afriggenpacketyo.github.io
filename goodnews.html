A couple with young children earning a combined income of over ¬£50,000 expressed struggles with childcare costs and advocated for more support for working families.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, but strong platonic bonds are essential for well-being. Historically, friendships held significant importance, with men and women expressing deep affection for their friends. Cultural shifts and the sexualization of same-sex affection led to the prioritization of romantic partnerships. Maintaining friendships requires intentional effort, especially when entering a romantic relationship, and feelings of jealousy or sadness are common but shouldn't be cause for shame. By valuing friendships alongside romantic love, individuals can create a more balanced and supportive network.</p>
