          <p>CNBC's Investing Club analyzed recent market movements, noting a modest rise in stocks driven by Nvidia's strong performance in the AI sector, with the market receiving a brief boost after a court ruling on tariffs. Goldman Sachs' President John Waldron cautioned that investment banking activity in the second quarter has been weaker due to market volatility, but Goldman's trading desk has remained strong. Bristol Myers Squibb CEO Chris Boerner defended the company's schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, despite a failed trial, emphasizing its potential as a primary treatment. The report also mentions upcoming earnings reports from Costco, Marvell Technology, and Dell Technologies, and the expected release of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index.

Powell emphasized that future monetary policy decisions would be based on incoming economic data and careful, objective, non-political analysis. Trump reiterated his belief that the Fed should lower interest rates, arguing that it puts the U.S. at an economic disadvantage compared to other countries. This was the first meeting between the two since Trump began his second term, and markets anticipate the Fed will hold steady on rates until there is more economic clarity.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has placed new limits on federally mandated environmental impact statements for major transportation and energy projects, potentially expediting approvals for construction programs nationwide. In an 8-0 decision, the court sided with the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition in a case involving a proposed railway in Utah, ruling that environmental impact studies should focus on the immediate project and not secondary impacts. Justice Kavanaugh stated the law imposed a "modest procedural requirement" and that courts should show "deference" to agency officials preparing the statements.

The initiative seeks to put snakebite back on the global health agenda and highlight the need for investment in antivenom production and distribution.
