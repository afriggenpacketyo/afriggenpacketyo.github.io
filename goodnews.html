        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As students and families prepare for the 2025-26 academic year, a key decision involves choosing between federal and private student loans. Federal loans for the upcoming year offer fixed rates of 6.39% for undergraduates, but private lenders are advertising rates as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. While private loans can offer substantial savings, they lack the robust borrower protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. Experts suggest federal loans are a solid starting point, but comparing offers from private lenders is crucial for potentially lowering the overall cost of borrowing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Universal has submitted plans to build a major new theme park in Bedford, UK, which could feature rides up to 115 meters (377ft) high, making them the tallest in Europe. The company is seeking a special development order to fast-track government approval, bypassing local planning procedures. The proposed destination aims to attract 8.5 million visitors annually and includes plans for extensive transportation infrastructure, including a new A421 junction and an expanded local train station. The project is expected to create 8,500 jobs by its target opening date of 2031, with Universal citing the location's excellent transport links as a key factor in its selection.</p>

The new systems, built by Dell, are liquid-cooled and feature 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs, offering substantially more power for training and deploying AI models. This early access to NVIDIA's latest technology gives CoreWeave a competitive edge over larger cloud providers like Amazon and Microsoft. The announcement highlights the close relationship between NVIDIA, which is an investor in CoreWeave, and the high demand for cutting-edge AI hardware.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released a 10-year plan aimed at reforming England's National Health Service, emphasizing a shift from hospitals to community-based care and a greater focus on prevention. Key proposals include creating up to 300 neighborhood health centers, expanding access to weight-loss treatments to combat obesity, and increasing the use of the NHS app for a more integrated patient experience. The plan also aims to address dental care shortages and improve mental health services with dedicated A&E departments.

          <p>The British rock band Wet Leg is preparing to release their sophomore album, "Moisturizer," which represents a significant sonic and visual evolution from their Grammy-winning 2022 debut. In an interview, frontwoman Rhian Teasdale described the new record as more sonically expressive and raw, reflecting the band's growth after three years of touring. The album explores themes of love and heartbreak, a departure from their earlier work, which Teasdale attributes to a new, profound romantic relationship. The band maintains its signature tongue-in-cheek lyrical style but has developed a more muscular sound, which they are excited to perform live.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience by adding 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and signaling economic strength despite the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. The unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.1%, with notable job gains in state government and healthcare. While the robust numbers have surprised some economists who anticipated a slowdown due to tariffs, other data suggests some employers are showing hesitancy in creating new positions. The White House has downplayed the economic impact of the tariffs as a key deadline for their potential expansion approaches next week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's major tax and spending bill contains several provisions that will significantly benefit wealthy Americans, according to tax experts. The legislation is expected to increase the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions to $40,000 for those earning under $500,000 while preserving a popular workaround for business owners. It also expands benefits for investors in qualified small businesses and makes the higher estate tax exemption permanent. While most Americans will see some benefit from the extension of the 2017 tax cuts, high-income earners are projected to receive the largest boost in after-tax income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drawing on the wisdom of the Roman philosopher Cicero, this article explores the timeless argument that virtuous behavior is the most reliable path to both worldly success and personal happiness. In his work "On Duties," Cicero contended that there is no conflict between doing what is morally right and achieving what is personally beneficial in the long run. He argued that while unethical shortcuts might offer temporary gains, they ultimately harm one's character and reputation. Modern social science supports this view, showing that traits like loyalty, honesty, and generosity are consistently linked to higher life satisfaction and stronger relationships.</p>

In contrast, the federal government continued to shrink, shedding another 7,000 jobs as part of the Trump administration's job-cutting initiatives.

          <p>A comparison of current interest rates shows that a high-yield savings account would narrowly outperform a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) for a $10,000 deposit over various terms. For example, over 18 months, a savings account at 4.30% would earn slightly more than an 18-month CD at 4.26%. However, this calculation assumes interest rates remain constant, which is unlikely. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates soon, the fixed rate of a CD could prove more profitable in the long run than the variable rate of a savings account, making it a potentially smarter choice to lock in a high rate now.
