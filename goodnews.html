          <p>Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a U.S.-brokered peace plan, aiming to end the two-year conflict. This initial stage involves the release of all remaining living hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and an Israeli military withdrawal to an agreed-upon line within Gaza. The plan also stipulates the entry of hundreds of daily aid trucks to address the severe humanitarian crisis and the deployment of a U.S.-overseen multinational force to monitor the ceasefire. Subsequent phases, which include Gaza's demilitarization and future governance, remain complex points for future negotiation.</p>

          <p>As the Norwegian Nobel Committee prepares to announce the 2025 Peace Prize winner, Donald Trump is a significant figure in the speculation due to his role in brokering the Gaza ceasefire. Trump has publicly claimed he deserves the award for resolving multiple global conflicts, citing the Israel-Hamas deal as the most significant. While the list of 338 candidates is officially secret, nominators can publicize their choices, and Trump's recent diplomatic efforts have drawn considerable attention to his potential candidacy. The announcement is highly anticipated, with the prize recognizing achievements that promote peace and resolve conflict.</p>

          <p>Facing persistent political deadlock and instability that has led to comparisons with Italy, France is reportedly considering the appointment of a technocratic government. President Emmanuel Macron is expected to name a new prime minister who is disconnected from future presidential ambitions, a move aimed at stabilizing the country and passing a crucial budget. This approach, common in Italy with figures like Mario Draghi, could reassure investors and provide a temporary solution to the current parliamentary stalemate. The name of François Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France, has been mentioned as a potential candidate for the role.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Nearly All Heart Attack Sufferers Share at Least One of Four Key Risk Factors</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive new study has revealed that over 99 percent of individuals who experience a heart attack have at least one of four major modifiable risk factors: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high blood sugar, or a history of tobacco use. The research, which analyzed health records of over nine million people, found that high blood pressure was the most common factor, affecting more than 95 percent of victims. The findings underscore the critical importance of managing these known health risks for preventing cardiovascular events. Researchers emphasize that focusing on controlling these factors is the most effective strategy for public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their "golden generation" of players as "egotistical losers" who failed to perform as a cohesive team. Speaking on his podcast, Rooney disagreed with the characterization, stating that while the team had big personalities, they worked hard and simply "didn't quite manage to get over the line" in major tournaments. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and better media relations, rather than a superior attitude, attributing their own era's shortcomings to circumstance rather than a lack of effort.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare at his party's annual conference that they are ready to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party in the next Senedd election. He will position Plaid Cymru not as a party to support Labour, but as a distinct alternative capable of forming a "new government, with new energy." With Labour dominating Welsh politics for a century, this marks a bold challenge, as recent polling suggests a tighter race between Labour, Plaid Cymru, and Reform UK. The speech aims to frame the election as a choice for change.</p>

          <p>London councils will receive a £36.5 million funding boost from the government to address the city's severe homelessness crisis this winter. The capital, where one in 50 people are homeless, will get the largest share of a national fund, with the money targeted at preventing rough sleeping and supporting families in temporary accommodation. The investment has been welcomed by the Mayor of London and homelessness charities, who described it as critical. However, advocates also stress the need for a long-term strategy to tackle the root causes, as recent data shows a record number of deaths among the homeless population.</p>

The breakthrough came as part of "Operation Identify Me," an international police campaign that uses public appeals and shared data to name unidentified deceased women. A tip from a German television broadcast led investigators to Pommer, and her identity was confirmed through DNA. She is the fourth person to be named through the initiative, which aims to bring closure to families and advance investigations into unexplained deaths across Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists from China and Spain has discovered that adding salt to ice allows it to generate a significant electrical charge when bent or subjected to non-uniform strain. This phenomenon, known as flexoelectricity, produces an electrical response comparable to that of specialized ceramic materials. The researchers have already fabricated devices using saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost, clean energy source in cold environments. This finding opens up new possibilities for harnessing power in frigid regions through simple mechanical stress on a readily available material.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed the defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit song "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a highly publicized rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable fact by a reasonable listener. Drake had sued the record label, which represents both artists, for allowing the song's publication and promotion. A spokesperson for Drake indicated that he plans to appeal the court's decision.</p>

The loss for Philadelphia was marked by uncharacteristic mistakes from Hurts and a defense that struggled to contain New York's emerging young players.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning and market regulation agencies have jointly issued new guidelines to address destructive price competition in the country's economy. The policy aims to limit the intense price wars seen in some sectors, which officials say harm healthy industry development, innovation, and product quality. Regulators will guide industry associations in evaluating production costs to help establish reasonable prices and will intervene with warnings and investigations when necessary. This move signals a greater level of state intervention to manage market dynamics and ensure stability in key industries. (not investment advice)</p>
