          <p>PayPal has announced a new service, "Pay with Crypto," that will permit businesses to accept payments in more than 100 different cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service aims to simplify cross-border commerce by automatically converting crypto payments into fiat currency or stablecoins, such as PayPal's own PYUSD. To encourage adoption, PayPal is offering a promotional transaction rate of 0.99% until July 2026, which is notably lower than typical credit card fees. The company believes this will help address crypto's volatility and complexity challenges for merchants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Human Immune System Can Be Triggered by Visual Cues of Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 11:09:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system can be activated merely by the sight of an infection, even in a virtual reality environment. Researchers observed that when participants viewed avatars appearing sick, their brains reacted and triggered a systemic immune response, evidenced by increased activity in specific immune cells in their blood. This response intensified when the sick-looking avatars appeared to move closer. The findings suggest the brain proactively prepares the body for a potential threat, opening possibilities for new non-pharmacological therapies, such as boosting vaccine efficacy or treating allergies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 11:02:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is booking profits by selling shares of the industrial company Eaton, as its stock price reaches another record high. The sale is motivated by the belief that the recent stock surge, linked to a new U.S.-E.U. trade deal, is an overreaction to the market potential for its LNG-related products. The cash generated from this trade will be used to invest in other industrial stocks like Honeywell and Dover, which are viewed as having more growth potential. This specific transaction realizes a gain of approximately 75% on the shares sold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant jump after the European Union agreed to purchase $750 billion worth of energy from the United States. This move, part of a broader trade deal, is intended to reduce the EU's reliance on Russian natural gas and enhance its energy security. Companies involved in LNG exportation and infrastructure, such as Cheniere, Venture Global, and NextDecade, saw their stock values increase by 2% to 4%. The energy agreement is a key component of the new transatlantic trade deal that also establishes a 15% tariff on EU exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:51:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing a new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a dangerous condition that contributes to 5-10% of general aviation accidents. The system, which could be integrated into a flight suit or pilot's seat, uses haptic vibrations to provide sensory cues, similar to a car's lane departure warning. This would help pilots maintain their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses are compromised, such as in cloudy weather. Given that 90% of accidents caused by spatial disorientation are fatal, this technology could significantly improve flight safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a substantial sum like $20,000, short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) currently provide a higher and more secure return than high-yield savings accounts. Calculations show that for terms ranging from three months to one year, a CD with a fixed rate consistently earns more interest than a high-yield savings account with a variable rate. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% on $20,000 would earn $880, whereas a savings account at 4.30% would yield $860. The key advantage of a CD is its guaranteed return, which is locked in regardless of future interest rate changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address its demographic crisis, the Chinese government will provide parents with an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for each child under the age of three. This national policy follows various provincial-level incentives aimed at boosting the country's plummeting birth rate, which fell by half between 2016 and 2024. While analysts view the subsidies as a positive step, they caution that the amount is likely too small to significantly reverse the trend of population decline or stimulate domestic consumption. Many young couples remain hesitant to have more children due to high living costs and career pressures.</p>

          <p>A decade after the "false nine" role suggested the traditional center-forward was obsolete, the position is making a major comeback, dominating this summer's transfer market. While goal-scoring wide forwards remain prevalent, top clubs are again prioritizing powerful central strikers like Erling Haaland, whose signing prompted a tactical shift at Manchester City. The article notes that the modern No. 9, exemplified by players like Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres, is a more complete athlete, combining the skills of a target-man, channel-runner, and poacher. This evolution signals a new tactical age for the striker in elite football.</p>

This contrasts sharply with other major sports leagues where players get close to 50%.
