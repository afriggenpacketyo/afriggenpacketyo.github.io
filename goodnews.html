          <p>A Chinese research team, comprising experts from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology, has successfully developed a novel blockchain technology engineered to resist potential attacks from quantum computers. This advancement addresses a critical vulnerability, as current blockchain encryption methods are susceptible to sophisticated quantum computing capabilities, which could undermine the security of decentralized ledgers used in finance and supply chains. The new technology seeks to ensure the long-term integrity and tamper-proof nature of digital records, a crucial step for future digital security and trust. This significant innovation aims to future-proof blockchain infrastructure against emerging cyber threats, providing a more robust foundation for its widespread application and global adoption.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi recently informed an EU delegation, led by top diplomat Kaja Kallas, that Europe's current challenges do not stem from Beijing, explicitly stating, "China is not the United States." Wang emphasized China's diplomatic approach, which upholds principles of peace, tolerance, and cooperation, asserting its superior track record among major powers on matters of peace and security. He urged Europe not to perceive China as an adversary solely due to differing histories, cultures, or values, nor to seek confrontation over disagreements. This communication aims to strengthen China-Europe ties by distinguishing Beijing's international posture from that of Washington and fostering a more cooperative relationship.</p>

          <p>All 15 individuals aboard a skydiving aircraft sustained injuries after the small plane crashed at Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, on Wednesday. The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff, attempting to return to the airport but failing to land successfully. Three people were transported to a trauma center with severe or critical injuries, while eight were treated for less serious injuries, and four had minor injuries. Emergency responders declared a mass casualty incident, crediting a recent mass casualty training exercise at the airport for the coordinated and effective response. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, which surprisingly resulted in no fatalities.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are witnessing a significant resurgence, fueled by a surge of Chinese companies seeking listings, making it the strongest first half-year for fundraising since 2021. New listing volumes jumped eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of this year, positioning the city to potentially become the world's largest listing destination, with PwC projecting up to 100 IPOs. This renewed interest is attributed to Beijing's supportive regulatory policies, a muted pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and delisting concerns in U.S. markets. The trend reflects Chinese firms' strategy to expand globally and diversify funding, particularly through A-to-H dual listings, leveraging Hong Kong's more fungible currency.

          <p>A missing wing flap from Delta Air Lines Flight No. 3247, a Boeing 737-900, was discovered on a Raleigh, North Carolina, driveway after the plane safely landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The FAA confirmed the part belonged to the Delta jet, which had departed from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. Delta reported the missing portion of the left wing's trailing edge flap during a post-landing inspection. There were six crew members and 109 passengers on board, and remarkably, no injuries were reported despite the incident. The flight had landed late due to a thunderstorm. The FAA is currently investigating how the part detached and where it landed.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Southern Border Asylum Ban</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., Judge Randolph Moss, has blocked the Trump administration's policy that restricted migrants crossing the southern border from seeking asylum. In a 128-page order, Judge Moss stated that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to "adopt an alternative immigration system." The executive order, issued in January, declared the border situation an "invasion" and suspended asylum access. Despite a recent Supreme Court ruling limiting judges' power to issue nationwide injunctions, Moss deemed this a rare case requiring such relief. The decision is seen as critical for those fleeing danger and a reaffirmation of congressional law over presidential unilateralism.</p>

          <h2>New Study Links Estrogen Plus Progestin Hormone Therapy to Increased Breast Cancer Risk</h2>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that women under 55 with a uterus who use estrogen plus progestin hormone therapy for menopause symptoms may face a higher risk of breast cancer. Conversely, the study found that estrogen-alone therapy reduces breast cancer risk in women without a uterus. Dr. C√©line Gounder explained that the combination therapy is necessary for women with a uterus to prevent endometrial cancer. This research updates previous understandings, emphasizing that timing and type of hormone therapy are crucial, advising individuals to consult their doctors to weigh risks and benefits based on personal health factors.</p>
