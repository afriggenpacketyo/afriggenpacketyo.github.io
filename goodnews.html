          <h2>Bipartisan Senators Advocate for Advanced Female Crash Test Dummies to Improve Auto Safety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 11:27:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of women senators is championing the "She Drives Act" to mandate the use of advanced female crash test dummies in federal crashworthiness tests, aiming to improve auto safety for women. Current data shows women are significantly more likely to suffer serious injuries or fatalities in car crashes. The proposed legislation seeks to incorporate dummies that better represent the driving public, including a 4'11", 108-pound female model, to gather more precise data on injury patterns. While some advocate for virtual testing, supporters argue these new dummies are crucial for designing safer vehicles, with the Department of Transportation committed to accelerating their development.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has increased its holdings in Dover, an industrial stock, following a new bullish endorsement from Citi, which named Dover its "Top Pick in the Multi-industrials" and raised its price target. Citi anticipates accelerating growth, highlighting Dover's high-margin niche businesses and improved operational executive under CEO Rich Tobin. Despite this positive outlook, Dover shares fell, potentially due to President Trump's threatened 30% tariffs on the European Union and Mexico, given that roughly 30% of Dover's cost of goods base is from Europe. However, the article suggests Dover has tools to mitigate such tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Rally Sustained by Institutional Demand, Not Speculation, as It Hits Record Highs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 11:09:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new record high, surpassing $120,000, with evidence suggesting its rally is more stable and institutionally driven than previous speculative surges. Strong inflows into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and increasing corporate treasury allocations are fueling this rise, indicating a shift towards longer-term, less volatile investment. While open interest in Bitcoin futures is at a record high, funding rates remain subdued, signaling reduced speculative demand. Data from Glassnode also shows a decline in Bitcoin's estimated leverage ratio, further supporting the view that the current surge is backed by real capital rather than borrowed money.

          <p>Bitcoin surged past $120,000 to a new record high, propelled by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation of potential U.S. regulatory changes. The U.S. House of Representatives is set to deliberate on several crypto bills during "Crypto Week," aiming to establish a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. This legislative push, supported by President Donald Trump, includes the proposed Genius Act, which could regulate stablecoins and create pathways for digital dollars. Experts note that corporate and institutional investors are primarily driving this rally, with long-term holders locking up supply, boosting investor confidence and capital inflows.

          <h2>Experts Advise on Optimal CD Term Choices Amid Potential Fed Rate Cuts</h2>

          <p>Financial experts are advising on the best certificate of deposit (CD) terms to open this July, as potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts loom in the second half of the year. While longer-term CDs traditionally offer higher rates, current market expectations of falling rates mean short-term CDs may continue to be more competitive. The choice depends on individual financial situations, including liquidity needs and desired earnings. For those uncertain, a "CD ladder" strategy, spreading investments across various terms, is suggested to balance access to funds with locking in higher long-term yields. High-yield savings accounts are also presented as a flexible alternative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article details the capabilities of the MIM-104 Patriot missile system, a surface-to-air defense system manufactured by Raytheon, which President Donald Trump announced would be sent to Ukraine. These mobile batteries, valued at over $1 billion per system, are designed to intercept tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, drones, and aircraft. While effective against many airborne threats, they face challenges with smaller, low-flying devices. Germany has agreed to fund at least two Patriot batteries for Ukraine, a move that comes amidst reduced U.S. support and aims to bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities. The Kremlin, however, views these supplies as continued U.S. involvement.</p>

          <p>Ultium Cells, a collaborative venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, has announced a significant upgrade to its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility. The aim is to commence production of low-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) electric vehicle battery cells. These LFP cells are projected to be considerably more affordable than conventional lithium-ion batteries, primarily because they do not require expensive minerals such as cobalt and nickel. This strategic initiative will diversify GM's electric vehicle lineup and scale the domestic production of more economical battery technologies. Commercial manufacturing of these new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027, representing a key advancement in reducing EV production expenses.</p>

          <p>A Dutch court has confiscated $112 million in illicit gains from Jos Leijdekkers, known as "Chubby Jos," one of Europe's most notorious drug lords, who is believed to be hiding in Sierra Leone. The seized assets stem from extensive cocaine trafficking and gold purchases, though prosecutors' initial request for a higher amount was reduced due to stricter legal criteria. Leijdekkers, sentenced in absentia to 24 years for murder and cocaine shipments, is on Europol's most-wanted list with a substantial reward for information leading to his arrest. Suspicions of his presence in Sierra Leone arose from images seemingly showing him with high-ranking officials.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has expressed that securing a victory at this week's Open Championship on his home course, Royal Portrush, would be "just as emotional" as his career Grand Slam triumph at the Masters. Having previously missed the cut when Portrush last hosted The Open in 2019, the 36-year-old golf sensation feels he has matured significantly and is better prepared to navigate the intense pressure of the event. He plans to embrace the strong support from his home crowd, a departure from his previous approach. McIlroy, who achieved a second-place finish at last year's Irish Open, is confident his refined game will give him an excellent chance to contend for the title.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's rare earth exports experienced a significant surge in June, reaching their highest volume since December 2009, with a remarkable 60% increase compared to the previous year. Analysts are interpreting this substantial rise as an early indicator of a potential easing in the strained critical mineral trade relations between Beijing and Washington. Evidence supporting this includes reports from late June about six-month export licenses being granted to specific American manufacturers. Furthermore, China's Ministry of Commerce recently declared its intention to simplify export approvals for European countries, facilitating legitimate trade. This development suggests a possible relaxation of prior export controls on these vital elements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring a "fresh vision" for the Post Office, including the possibility of its ownership being transferred to its postmasters, as part of a new public consultation. This move aims to transform the organization's culture in the wake of the Horizon scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted due to faulty software. While the government does not plan to reduce the current 11,500 branch network, it seeks to restore trust and debate future operating models, such as mutual ownership or a charter model. The consultation also seeks views on expanding services, particularly banking, given the closure of High Street branches.</p>
