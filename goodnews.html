          <p>The White House announced that the U.S. and China reached a trade deal after negotiations in Geneva, although specific details were not immediately provided. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the talks as productive, promising a more comprehensive briefing on Monday, while U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer hailed the discussions as constructive. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the agreement to establish a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues, suggesting further details would be forthcoming. While specifics are scarce, the agreement signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war, which has negatively impacted the global economy, potentially providing relief to businesses and consumers, and the Chinese negotiator Li Chenggang said that the deal would be good news for the world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline executives to address ongoing disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport, including technological issues and staffing shortages. Duffy warned that other U.S. airports could face similar problems during the summer travel season, citing antiquated systems as a major concern. The announcement follows a series of outages at Newark's air traffic control facility, leading to significant delays and cancellations, raising safety concerns for travelers. Duffy's proposal to improve air travel involves investments in digitizing flight data and upgrading radio systems, requiring congressional approval, although some details are unclear, and he denied that recent layoffs at the F.A.A. contributed significantly to the problems.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reveals that Eli Lilly's Zepbound led to significantly more weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy in a head-to-head clinical trial. Participants taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight on average than those using Wegovy over 72 weeks. Zepbound targets two hormones that regulate appetite, while Wegovy targets only one, potentially explaining the difference in efficacy. Despite these findings, both drugs are considered important tools for treating obesity, with access and affordability remaining key challenges, and it's important to note that a drug may work well for one patient, but not for others.</p>

          <p>The first group of white South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S. due to claims of racial discrimination, departed Johannesburg for Washington, D.C. This initiative, expedited by President Trump, contrasts with the administration's restrictive refugee policies for other groups. The South African government views the resettlement as politically motivated, while the U.S. State Department maintains it is prioritizing Afrikaners facing unjust racial discrimination. The arrival of this group highlights ongoing tensions and differing perspectives on racial inequalities in South Africa.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that the royal family of Qatar is donating a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet for President Trump's exclusive use as a presidential plane. The plane will be checked for security before it can be used as Air Force One and is expected to be transferred to the future Trump presidential library before he leaves office. While Qatari officials have confirmed discussions about the possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use, they deny that the gift will be donated during Trump's upcoming trip. Democratic Representative Ritchie Torres has called for an ethics investigation into the acceptance of the plane as a gift, citing concerns about potential violations of federal ethics regulations and the Emoluments Clause.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system by tightening English tests for visa applicants and extending the settlement period to ten years. The reforms aim to create a controlled, selective, and fair system, with exceptions for high-skilled workers in sectors like nursing and engineering. Adult dependents will also be required to demonstrate basic English skills to promote integration and prevent exploitation, though critics warn this could split families. The move follows significant gains by Reform UK in local elections, reflecting public concerns about both legal and illegal migration.</p>
