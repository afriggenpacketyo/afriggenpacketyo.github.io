          <p>British newspapers lead with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected reversal on winter fuel payment cuts, planning to restore payments and then recoup the money from wealthier pensioners through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential difficulties in recovering payments from deceased pensioners' families. The papers also highlight competing immigration policies from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, as well as Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's successful defense against cuts to the warm homes plan. Other headlines include free school meals for more children and Trump's tax cuts increasing US debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A charity is advocating for pensions to support retired police dogs, citing the significant medical needs and risks they face during their service. Many retired police dogs require costly veterinary care due to chronic health issues and service-related injuries. Adopters often bear the financial burden of these expenses, which can deter potential adopters. The charity argues that providing pensions would ensure these animals receive the care they deserve after dedicating their lives to protecting the community.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition with its solar panels, setting a model for the Global South. The report notes that cheap Chinese solar panels undercut demand for coal-fired plants that China helped finance, creating stranded assets. It also emphasizes developing indigenous manufacturing due to rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals. A Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is economically feasible, highlighting the complexities of balancing energy needs with economic realities.</p>
