          <h2>Opinion Piece Suggests Pessimistic Forecasts of China's Population Decline Warrant Skepticism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article challenges the validity of drastic projections suggesting a severe decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author argues that such forecasts often lack clear justification, especially when contrasted with projections of population growth in countries like the United States. The piece points to alternative data from Chinese researchers at Renmin and Peking Universities, which present a more moderate scenario with China's population potentially reaching around 1.12 billion. It suggests that geopolitical trends and declining fertility rates are complex factors that may not lead to the gloomy outcomes some predict.</p>

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former Russian professional footballer and popular YouTuber, has successfully guided his football club, Krasava ENY Ypsonas, to Cyprus's top division. After condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Savin fled his home country, where he was later sentenced in absentia for "discrediting" the army. He re-established his club in Cyprus, investing his own money and creating a team that unites immigrants from various post-Soviet nations, including Russians and Ukrainians. Despite personal hardships, Savin has built a community around the club and now aims to qualify for European competitions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated what it calls a "historic" reform of the U.S. organ procurement system to improve accountability and patient safety. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the first-ever mid-cycle decertification of an organ procurement organization (OPO), targeting the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency in Miami for a history of deficiencies linked to patient harm. Officials highlighted that thousands of donated organs are discarded annually and over 100,000 people are on waiting lists. The reforms include a new direct reporting channel for misconduct and a $25 million investment to support living donors.</p>

The call is seen as a crucial precursor to a potential in-person summit between the two leaders at the APEC meeting later this year. This would be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to the White House. According to reports, China has extended a formal state visit invitation to Trump, with preparations underway that may include large-scale purchase agreements for items like Boeing aircraft and soybeans.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, with new models drawing long queues in major cities like Beijing and London. The global release is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets, particularly from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi in China. While initial preorders appear strong, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The new lineup includes the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max, and the new thin iPhone Air, alongside updated Apple Watch and AirPods models.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is intensifying its competition with rival Meituan by launching a new service offering discounted in-store dining vouchers. The initiative, operated under its Taobao Shangou and Ele.me units, will initially roll out in select districts of major Chinese cities. This move places Alibaba in direct competition with a core business of Meituan and a similar service offered by ByteDance's Douyin. The launch is timed just ahead of China's "golden week" holiday, a period of high consumer travel and spending, signaling a strategic push to capture a larger share of the local services market.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese military researchers outlines a plan to construct a naval "Great Wall" to defend against large-scale drone swarm attacks, which they warn could overwhelm traditional warship defenses. The proposed framework includes a variety of countermeasures, such as high-power microwave weapons, ship-mounted lasers, and long-range hypersonic cruise missiles. The research aligns with new anti-drone weapon systems that were recently displayed in a major military parade. This development highlights China's focus on countering emerging military threats posed by coordinated, numerous, and stealthy unmanned aerial systems.</p>

          <p>Nick Mondek, an anesthesiologist battling a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, has received a lifesaving stem cell transplant from his 10-year-old son, Stephen. After his cancer returned and no other genetic matches were found, Stephen was identified as a compatible partial-match donor. The young boy bravely underwent the complex donation procedure, becoming one of the youngest known stem cell donors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The transplant offers hope that Stephen's cells will build a new, stronger immune system for his father to fight the cancer, though full recovery could take over a year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers on when it might be beneficial to refinance existing debts like mortgages, auto loans, and student loans. While the cut may provide some relief, borrowing costs tend to fall slowly, and a series of cuts may be needed for a refinance to be worthwhile. Generally, a refinance makes sense if there is at least a one-percentage-point difference between the current rate and a new one. Experts also caution against refinancing too frequently due to closing costs and recommend focusing on the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article critiques the AI doomsaying movement, particularly the arguments presented in Eliezer Yudkowsky's new book, "If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies." The author contends that the fear of a world-ending superintelligence is based on flawed logic, shaky analogies, and a fundamental misunderstanding of both human and artificial intelligence. The piece argues that doomers and AI accelerationists are two sides of the same coin, both believing in the transformative power of a hypothetical superintelligence. Ultimately, these extreme narratives serve the interests of tech oligarchs by distracting from the real, immediate harms of current AI technology.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, aged 80 and 76, have lived and run a charity in the country for almost two decades and were arrested in February without being formally charged. Their release was secured through mediation by Qatar, following months of lobbying by their family, who raised serious concerns about their deteriorating health in prison. The Taliban claimed the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the alleged offense.</p>
