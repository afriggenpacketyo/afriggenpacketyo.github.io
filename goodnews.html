The fourth ministerial meeting of the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum underscored this growing relationship. Infrastructure is likely to remain a key sector of engagement for Beijing, helping to counter US influence in the region. During the forum, President Xi Jinping offered a US$9.2 billion credit line to support development, positioning China as a reliable partner amid global trade tensions.

The surgery involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. The chordoma was successfully removed, and Flores has no evidence of cancer nearly a year after completing treatment.

          <p>Angela Duckworth, a psychologist and author, emphasizes the importance of teaching children how to use AI effectively to enhance their learning. Rather than simply copying and pasting AI-generated answers, students should be encouraged to ask follow-up questions and understand how AI models reach their conclusions. Duckworth suggests that AI can serve as a "coach" by providing examples and clarifying complex concepts. Experts recommend using AI for tasks that don't involve the final product, such as creating outlines, and always verifying its factual claims. Properly utilizing AI can help students develop critical thinking skills and improve their understanding of various subjects. </p>

Trump Media and GameStop have announced plans to invest in bitcoin, while Tether, SoftBank, and Strike are launching a bitcoin-native public company. However, the market's reaction has been mixed, with shares of Trump Media and GameStop declining after their announcements. Saylor believes that bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be popular over the long term, and sees a global shift in corporate finance. The Biden administration has previously treated corporate bitcoin adoption with regulatory caution, but the Trump administration has taken a more favorable approach. </p>
