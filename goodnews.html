          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a celebrated figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89 due to pneumonia. Known as "Mr. Giants," Nagashima was a key player and manager for the Yomiuri Giants, contributing significantly to the team's dominance in the 1960s and 1970s. His charismatic personality and on-field heroics made him a national icon, fondly remembered by many Japanese as a symbol of the country's economic boom era. His retirement was a major national news event, and his famous speech at his retirement ceremony has become ingrained in Japanese culture.</p>

          <p>Following technical and logistical issues during the February California bar exam, a committee approved new scoring adjustments, leading to more than 200 test-takers changing from "fail" to "pass." The grading change raised the exam's overall pass rate from 56% to 63%, nearly doubling the state's historical average. Applicants who nearly passed and received a second read on their written questions will be given the higher of two scores for each question. The state bar has already implemented a lower raw passing score and "imputed" scores for test takers who failed to complete significant portions of the two-day exam.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is increasing its defense spending and modernizing its military capabilities in response to perceived threats from Russia and concerns about the future of NATO. The plans include building new nuclear-powered attack submarines, increasing weapons stockpiles, and investing in cyber defense. Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized the need to confront growing threats on land, air, sea, and in cyberspace, aiming to make the British Army more lethal. This strategic shift also serves as a message to Washington that Europe is committed to investing in its own security.</p>
