          <p>A Reddit post showing McDonald's prices from 1991 has sparked a discussion among millennials about the rising cost of fast food. While many fondly recalled cheaper prices and claimed the food quality was better, others argued that when adjusted for inflation, current prices are comparable. One user attempted to recreate a 1991 order using modern app deals, finding the inflation-adjusted cost to be very similar. McDonald's responded by emphasizing its commitment to value through various deals and its McValue offerings.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company plans to file for approval later this year, with expectations for both products to be available in 2025. This development positions Moderna as a frontrunner in the race to market a combination vaccine.</p>

          <p>Fast-food chain Raising Cane's has surpassed KFC to become the third-largest chicken chain in the U.S. by annual sales, driven by a focused menu and aggressive expansion. The company, which specializes in chicken fingers, has more than doubled its sales since 2021 by maintaining a simple, consistent menu and operating most of its locations company-owned rather than franchised. This strategy has resulted in high efficiency and average unit volumes of $6.6 million. With plans to reach nearly 1,000 restaurants by 2025, founder Todd Graves aims for Raising Cane's to become a top 10 restaurant chain.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barry, the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, has weakened into a tropical depression after making landfall on Mexico's eastern coast. The system came ashore south of Tampico, bringing heavy rainfall and a risk of flooding to the region through Monday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center lifted all tropical storm warnings but cautioned that the storm's remnants would continue to produce significant precipitation as it moves inland. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie is brewing off Mexico's southwestern coast and is expected to intensify.</p>

The decision came after President Trump announced a suspension of negotiations, calling the proposed tax a "blatant attack" on the U.S. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke by phone, agreeing to restart discussions toward a new economic and security relationship. The rescinded tax would have imposed a 3% levy on Canadian revenue from major tech companies like Google and Meta, applying retroactively.</p>

          <p>In contrast to Hollywood's cautious approach, China's film industry is fully embracing artificial intelligence, with a new government-backed project to "revitalize" 100 classic kung fu films. The China Film Foundation plans to use AI for tasks like creating animated versions of iconic movies such as "A Better Tomorrow" and "Police Story," aiming to reintroduce them to younger, global audiences. This initiative highlights the different cultural and regulatory attitudes toward AI, as China faces fewer labor union and intellectual property constraints than the U.S. The project has raised concerns among some U.S. artists and guilds about altering a director's original work.</p>

          <p>Interior designers are encouraging homeowners to treat the bathroom as a serious space for art, moving beyond generic or humorous decorations. Experts suggest that any room, including the washroom, benefits from a thoughtful focal point to distract from its utilitarian functions. Instead of "bathroom art" clich√©s, they recommend using a wide range of pieces, from personal travel photos and vintage paintings to children's artwork. Key advice includes embracing elegant or whimsical themes, minding potential moisture damage for valuable pieces, and using strategies like gallery walls or propping art on vanities to create a finished, stylish look.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new, restrictive outdoor smoking ban that prohibits lighting up in public parks, on beaches, and near any location where children might be present, such as schools and bus stops. The measure is part of the government's push for a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032, with violators facing significant fines. While polls show public support for tighter restrictions, some citizens view the law as excessive, particularly as it impacts the traditional caf√© culture of smoking outdoors. The ban does not currently apply to e-cigarettes, a point of criticism for some who see vapes as a gateway for young people.</p>

          <p>Reddit is fighting to protect its vast repository of user-generated conversations in the age of AI, viewing the data as a valuable asset. The company has sued AI startup Anthropic for allegedly scraping its content to train large language models without permission, an act Reddit calls an unfair business practice. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging its own data with its "Reddit Answers" AI tool, which provides summaries based solely on user discussions. This dual strategy aims to monetize its data through licensing deals while preventing unauthorized use, as the company navigates the threat of AI chatbots replacing traditional web searches.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon Adopts Electronic Line Calling, Ending Era of Human Line Judges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:17:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in its 148-year history, the Wimbledon Championships will proceed without human line judges, fully adopting electronic line-calling technology across all courts. This move aligns Wimbledon with other major tournaments and marks the end of a long-standing tradition. While the technology promises greater accuracy, some players, officials, and fans express concern that it removes a human element and personality from the game. Former officials fear the change could also negatively impact the development pathway for future chair umpires, as line judging has traditionally been a crucial training ground.</p>
