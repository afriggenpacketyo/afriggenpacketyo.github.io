          <p>Apple has signed a five-year media rights agreement with Formula 1, making Apple TV the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for all races starting in 2026. The deal, valued at approximately $140 million per year, will include all F1 events within the standard Apple TV subscription, unlike its separate MLS Season Pass model. This move marks a significant expansion of Apple's live sports portfolio, replacing ESPN as the incumbent partner. The partnership builds on the success of the Apple-produced F1 movie starring Brad Pitt.</p>

The call comes after President Trump threatened significant new tariffs on Chinese imports in response to Beijing's export controls, creating a tense atmosphere. Despite the friction, Trump expressed optimism about the relationship and mentioned a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks. This conversation is seen as a potential step toward stabilizing the economic relationship between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the Rand Corporation suggests that stabilizing the U.S.-China rivalry is both possible and mutually beneficial, despite deep-seated differences. Researchers argue that while the two nations are far from ending their competition, they should seek ways to coexist to prevent the relationship from escalating to dangerous levels of tension. The report recommends that the United States should counter China's more aggressive ambitions while simultaneously seeking to manage the rivalry, similar to its approach during the Cold War. It notes that some openings for coexistence exist if they can be properly leveraged.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has offered its condolences following the death of former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, remembering him as an "old friend" of China. A foreign ministry spokesperson highlighted Murayama's contributions to China-Japan relations and his landmark 1995 statement expressing "deep remorse" for Japan's actions during World War II. Murayama was also the first sitting Japanese prime minister to visit the Marco Polo Bridge, a site marking the start of Japan's full-scale war with China. His efforts to acknowledge history are remembered as a positive step in the two nations' complex relationship.</p>

          <p>A senior analyst at Moody's Ratings has stated there is little evidence of a systemic problem in the U.S. banking system, despite recent market anxiety over bad loans held by some midsize banks. While acknowledging concerns about loose lending standards, the analyst found no signs of a widespread turn in the credit cycle that could trigger a broader crisis. The comments came after bank stocks fell sharply due to disclosures from Zions Bancorp and Western Alliance. The analyst noted that default rates on high-yield debt remain relatively low and that the overall economy has shown resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A policy solution known as "demand flexibility" is being proposed to address the growing strain on the U.S. power grid and rising household energy bills. The strategy involves rewarding customers, including large data centers and individual households, for reducing their electricity consumption during peak hours. This approach could add over 100GW of capacity, helping to manage the increased demand from AI, manufacturing, and electric vehicles without relying solely on new fossil fuel infrastructure. While some states have begun adopting these policies, advocates are pushing for wider implementation to improve grid efficiency.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has agreed to stop its video generation tool, Sora, from creating deepfake videos of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. after his estate and daughter publicly requested an end to the "disrespectful" content. The AI tool had been used to generate bizarre and offensive videos, including altered versions of his "I Have a Dream" speech. While OpenAI has paused images of Dr. King to strengthen its guardrails, the platform still permits the creation of videos featuring other historical figures, raising broader ethical concerns.

          <p>As exchange-traded funds (ETFs) grow in popularity, financial advisors are cautioning investors against common mistakes that can undermine long-term returns. Key errors include "chasing performance" by buying into funds that have recently surged and "trend hopping" into volatile thematic ETFs, such as those focused on AI or crypto. Advisors also stress the importance of paying attention to expense ratios, as seemingly small differences in fees can significantly erode gains over time. With the ETF market surpassing $11 trillion, experts emphasize the need for investors to understand their purchases and align them with financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized that while homicides are declining in many cities, gun violence disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities. Bragg also highlighted the importance of collaboration between law enforcement and community-based violence prevention programs, which currently face federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer reflects on her decision to marry her long-term partner of three decades primarily to gain access to his SAG-AFTRA health insurance. The arrangement, initially a practical solution, became complicated when the union later stripped senior performers of their coverage, rendering the "forever" promise void. This experience leads her to contemplate the fragile nature of permanence, drawing parallels with racial covenants in her home's original deed and the precariousness of legal protections. She concludes that true permanence lies not in paperwork but in the daily choice to stay together.</p>

Scholars called for a research approach that is more deeply rooted in the country's specific historical and social context, emphasizing the need for field research to correct biases. Lin Shangli, president of Renmin University, stated that China's transformation cannot be properly interpreted through Western logic due to vast differences in scale and structure.
