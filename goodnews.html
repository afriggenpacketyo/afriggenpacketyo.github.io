          <h2>Sources Indicate US and China to Extend Tariff Truce by 90 Days at Stockholm Talks</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources, Beijing and Washington are expected to agree to another 90-day extension of their tariff truce during trade talks in Stockholm. This would prevent the imposition of new tariffs and further escalation of the trade war, as the current suspension is set to expire on August 12. The talks are not anticipated to yield major breakthroughs on core issues like China's industrial overcapacity. However, the Chinese delegation is expected to press the U.S. on its 20% tariffs related to fentanyl, seeking more clarity on what would be required for those specific levies to be eased.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a bizarre incident in the Indian state of Bihar, a one-year-old boy named Govinda reportedly killed a cobra by biting it after the snake had coiled around his hands. The child was playing at home when the encounter occurred, and family members rushed to his aid after he had already bitten the snake. The boy fainted and was taken to a local hospital, where he was treated and is now in stable condition, having apparently suffered only mild effects from the venom. The incident highlights the dangers of snakebites in India, which records tens of thousands of snakebite-related fatalities each year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Rep. Thomas Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force the release of files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Their joint legislation would compel a House vote on the matter, creating a legal mandate for the files' release while protecting victims' identities. After the House Speaker sent Congress into recess, effectively dodging the vote, the representatives are now seeking a discharge petition, which would bypass the Speaker if it gains 218 signatures. The push for transparency comes amid continued political controversy over the Justice Department's handling of the case.</p>

          <h2>Financial Columnist Analyzes 'Trump IRA' for Children, Suggests Better Savings Options</h2>

          <p>A new individual retirement account for children, established under the Trump administration, aims to encourage youth savings by allowing parents to contribute up to $5,000 annually. This opinion article notes the program's main appeal is a one-time $1,000 government contribution for children born in a specific timeframe. However, the author argues that while this free money should be taken, other established savings vehicles offer superior long-term benefits. He suggests that parents would be better served by prioritizing 529 education savings plans or establishing whole life insurance policies for their children's financial future.

          <p>For 50 years, performer and musician Michael Feinstein has dedicated his career to the Great American Songbook. After getting his start as an archivist and companion to famed lyricist Ira Gershwin, Feinstein launched a successful performing career. He has since established the Great American Songbook Foundation in Indiana, which includes a museum and a summer academy to teach a new generation of performers about the works of composers like Gershwin and Cole Porter. Feinstein believes the songbook is an evolving tradition that also includes later artists like Carole King and Elton John.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas is making her directorial debut with the film "My Mother's Wedding," a project she co-wrote that draws on deep personal loss. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, is inspired by the childhood trauma Thomas experienced after her father, a Royal Navy pilot, was killed in a training accident when she was five. Her stepfather, also a pilot, died in a similar accident years later. The acclaimed star of "The English Patient" and "Four Weddings and a Funeral" discusses how this history shaped her creative process for the new, heartfelt film.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Happiness from Four-Day Workweek Stems from Increased Effectiveness, Not Just Free Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 09:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies on the four-day workweek reveal that the resulting boost in employee happiness comes from more than just an extra day off. According to lead researcher Juliet Schor, a primary factor is that workers feel more effective and productive while on the clock. Faced with a condensed schedule, teams are motivated to streamline processes, eliminate busywork, and focus on high-impact tasks. This heightened sense of professional accomplishment and control over their work contributes significantly to their overall well-being, reduced stress, and improved work-life balance, benefits that spill over into their personal lives.</p>

          <p>A travel writer with experience in 70 countries has outlined common phrases used by American tourists that can be perceived as rude, ignorant, or offensive in other cultures. The list includes asking for prices in U.S. dollars, repeatedly asking for American chains like Starbucks, and complimenting someone's English in a predominantly English-speaking country. The author explains the context behind why these phrases can be problematic, such as showing a lack of research or carrying colonial undertones. The advice aims to help travelers be more considerate and culturally aware guests when visiting foreign countries.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for talks aimed at ending a deadly border dispute that has killed at least 34 people and displaced more than 168,000. The diplomatic effort, hosted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follows pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who spoke with both leaders and urged a ceasefire. While both sides have agreed in principle to halt the fighting that flared up last week, they continue to trade blame for ongoing shelling and troop movements along the contested frontier, making the outcome of the talks uncertain.</p>

          <p>After years of turmoil, aerospace giant Boeing is showing signs of a turnaround under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement to stabilize the company. The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers have recently hit an 18-month high, and its stock is up over 30% this year. While significant challenges persist, including an FAA-imposed production cap on the 737 MAX and ongoing delays for new models, key airline customers have expressed renewed confidence in Boeing's quality and predictability. Analysts expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year.</p>
