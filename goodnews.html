          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX exclusively to its European Union users. This initiative marks the company's first venture into making private equity accessible on the blockchain, bypassing U.S. accredited investor rules. To promote the launch, Robinhood is giving away a total of $1.5 million in tokens to new users on its EU crypto app. The move is part of a larger global crypto expansion for the company, though similar offerings are not expected in the U.S. soon due to regulatory hurdles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Citigroup report on U.S. credit card data, overall spending on luxury goods fell in the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year. However, the jewelry category has consistently outperformed other luxury segments like leather goods and ready-to-wear apparel, with spending surging 10.1% year-over-year in May. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its sentimental value for commemorating milestones. In contrast, other luxury items like handbags have seen significant price hikes without offering much newness to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials noted that some of the complex schemes were operated by transnational criminal organizations, which used stolen American identities to submit fraudulent claims to programs like Medicare.

          <p>This article provides a guide on differentiating between heat exhaustion and the more severe heat stroke, offering advice on how to respond to each condition. Heat exhaustion is characterized by symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and cool skin, and should be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. If left untreated, it can escalate to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation fails, sweat production stops, and body temperature can rise to 41¬∞C (105.8¬∞F). In case of heat stroke, immediate emergency services are required, along with rapid cooling of the body.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A long-forgotten novel written in 1932 by a young Sebastian Haffner has become a bestseller in Germany, nearly 25 years after its discovery. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was written just as the Weimar Republic was collapsing and fascism was on the rise. Haffner, who later became a renowned journalist and historian in exile, shelved the manuscript, which was found by his son after his death in 1999. The book captures a final glimmer of hope and youthful freedom in Berlin before the darkness of the Nazi era, offering a stark contrast to his later, more somber historical analyses of that period.</p>

This development comes as Chinese researchers conduct terrestrial simulations for future lunar missions, testing autonomous robots in underground lava caves.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores a critical but often overlooked function of political protest: preventing the "spiral of silence." This phenomenon occurs when individuals mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet, which reinforces the false perception of public opinion and allows unpopular policies to persist. The article cites research showing that Americans consistently underestimate public support for climate action and abortion rights. Public demonstrations, like those after the Dobbs decision, can correct these misperceptions by providing a visible, public signal of collective belief, thereby breaking the spiral and building common knowledge about what society truly wants.</p>

          <p>A new law in Denmark has come into effect that requires women, upon turning 18, to be included in the military conscription system alongside men. Previously, military service was voluntary for women. Now, both men and women will be part of a lottery system that could require them to serve for an extended period of 11 months, up from four. This change, which follows the examples of Norway and Sweden, is part of Denmark's effort to boost its defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe.

          <p>Following China's imposition of new export restrictions on rare earth magnets, automakers and other industries are now actively seeking and willing to pay a premium for supply from outside of China. Companies building new magnet plants in locations like Estonia and Vietnam report a surge in interest from clients who were previously hesitant about higher costs. This shift marks a significant change in the market for these critical components, which are essential for electric vehicles and wind turbines. While a non-Chinese supply chain will take years to build, the crisis has forced customers to prioritize supply security over lowest cost. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests Chelsea's recent transfer activity, including the pursuit of Brighton's Jo√£o Pedro, is driven by head coach Enzo Maresca's desire to create a more versatile and unpredictable attack. Maresca's system, which often inverts full-backs and isolates wingers, struggled against deep-lying defenses last season. By adding players like Jo√£o Pedro, who can drop deep and link play, alongside speedy wingers and a traditional striker, Chelsea aims to have multiple modes of attack. The strategy is to build a complex, shape-shifting squad that can break down different opponents, even if it means established players like Ben Chilwell no longer fit the tactical profile.</p>
