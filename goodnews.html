          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release, citing a violation of her due process and First Amendment rights. Ozturk's lawyers argued that her detainment stemmed from an op-ed she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Leaders in Massachusetts, including Gov. Maura Healey, celebrated the ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's attempt to silence dissent. Ozturk expressed gratitude for the support she received and urged people not to forget other women in immigration detention centers.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the 10% baseline tariff rate on imports is likely to remain in place for the 'foreseeable future,' echoing President Trump's sentiments. Lutnick dismissed concerns that consumers would bear the brunt of increased costs, asserting that businesses and foreign countries will pay. However, data suggests that businesses are attempting to pass costs onto consumers, and consumer confidence has declined since the tariff announcement. Lutnick argued that domestically produced products without tariffs will force foreign competitors to compete more effectively.</p>

Despite the hype around AI, it is not yet capable of fully replacing human workers, especially in small and mid-sized companies.

While AI advancements are expected in the future, widespread worker replacement is not a reality in the foreseeable future.</p>
