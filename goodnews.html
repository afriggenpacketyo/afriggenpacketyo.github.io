          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy is spearheading an initiative to dismantle bureaucracy within the company, asserting that it stifles innovation and agility. Addressing third-party sellers, Jassy detailed plans to reset Amazon's corporate culture by flattening organizational hierarchies and improving worker-to-manager ratios by at least 15%. This strategic shift, which includes a "no bureaucracy email alias" that has already led to 455 process adjustments, aims to transform the retail and cloud computing giant into the "world's largest startup." These changes are integral to Jassy's broader efforts to reduce costs, optimize operations, and intensify investments in artificial intelligence to maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly evolving market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports contracted by a milder-than-expected 0.1% year-on-year in August, marking the fourth consecutive month of decline but showing improvement from July's 2.6% fall. This softer contraction was primarily driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia, its largest trading region, which climbed 1.7%. Imports also decreased at a slower pace of 5.2%. Despite the overall negative growth, the data suggests some resilience in the face of U.S. tariffs and earlier export front-loading. Economists anticipate the Bank of Japan to maintain current rates, though future export volumes could be impacted by slower external demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Metro train derailed in downtown Los Angeles near the 7th Street/Metro Center Station during the evening commute, causing significant disruptions to A and E line services. Fortunately, the train remained upright, and no injuries were reported in the incident. As a result, light rail service was halted at key stations, leading to major delays and necessitating shuttle bus alternatives for commuters. Authorities have not provided an estimated time for the removal of the disabled train or the full restoration of services, indicating an ongoing effort to clear the tracks and resume normal operations.</p>

While Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure and government backing, Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework could provide a crucial degree of international credibility. This unique position might alleviate Western skepticism towards a Chinese-led global AI center, fostering broader participation and helping Beijing navigate escalating US-China tech tensions.

Cooper, who waived his anonymity, reported the attack to police in 2004 but only pursued it further in 2018 after his jury service triggered flashbacks. Diagnosed with complex PTSD, Cooper now shares his story on social media, garnering a significant following and helping others who have experienced similar trauma.</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a "generational step change." While acknowledging AI's high energy consumption, Nadella emphasized its potential benefits in healthcare, public services, and business productivity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five partially completed, "illegal" homes in Laurel Canyon, the subject of two decades of legal disputes, are finally set for demolition under a plea agreement. The structures were part of a planned 21-home development, with permits issued in the late 1990s, but construction halted in 2002 pending an environmental impact assessment that never occurred. Subsequent owners attempted to restart the project without complying with a 2003 demolition order, leading to criminal charges against the latest developers. Los Angeles City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto stated this action resolves a long-standing issue for the community.</p>

          <p>A quarter of all driving tests in Great Britain are now taken in automatic cars, a significant increase driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales and the growing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs). Data from the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency shows a jump from 6.12% in 2012/13 to 26% in 2024/25, with projections for continued growth. This shift reflects evolving driver attitudes and the perceived ease of learning in automatics, which can simplify the test and enhance road safety.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur, under manager Thomas Frank, has notably shifted its focus to a "clean sheet mentality," achieving four shutouts in five games this season, a stark contrast to their previous attack-minded approach.

Players like Lucas Bergvall and Micky van de Ven highlighted the improved structure and defensive solidity, making Tottenham a difficult team to play against.

          <p>Northrop Grumman's Cygnus XL cargo ship, carrying over 11,000 pounds of supplies for the International Space Station, experienced two premature engine shutdowns, delaying its planned rendezvous. The issue occurred during burns designed to raise the spacecraft's orbit, though all other systems are reportedly normal. This marks a setback for the upgraded Cygnus XL's maiden flight, which was intended to deliver a significant increase in cargo capacity. Engineers are currently working to understand the problem and develop an alternative "burn plan" to ensure the successful delivery of essential spare parts, research material, and crew supplies to the station.</p>
