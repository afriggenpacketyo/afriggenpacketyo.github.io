          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey indicated that UK defence spending is expected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's plans to increase it to 2.5% by 2027. The upcoming strategic defence review will prioritize military and security spending, including the deployment of "digital" experts to protect troops from drones and control unmanned weapons. New money for defence will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income, and this cut in aid prompted International Development Minister Anneliese Dodds to resign in February. NATO is expected to call on allies to increase defence spending at an upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>Approximately 250 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities closed the road and advised the public to avoid the area, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate their queen. The road where the truck overturned was closed for 24 to 48 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen bee, and hive boxes from the overturned truck were recovered, restored and returned to use. By morning, most bees should have returned to their hives and those responsible for their delivery will be in charge.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is experiencing a decline in casual tourism due to inflation and higher prices, despite continued convention traffic. Visitor numbers have decreased compared to the previous year, and hotel occupancy rates have also slipped, with average nightly rates on the Las Vegas Strip increasing. International visitors, who tend to stay longer and spend more, are also fewer in number, and heavy traffic due to construction and special events is deterring some tourists. Despite these challenges, the summer calendar is full of events, and city officials remain optimistic about the city's resilience.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator stated that Japan and U.S. Cabinet members agreed in their talks that they are making progress toward a potential tariff deal as early as next month. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic revitalization, said that they plan to hold another round of negotiations before a Group of Seven summit in mid-June. Akazawa noted, however, that Tokyo's stance to demand the United States remove all its additional tariffs on Japanese imports has not changed, and he urged them to do so during the latest meeting, which lasted more than two hours. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump by phone, telling reporters afterward that each side was able to gain a better understanding of the views held by the other.</p>

He pledged that there will be no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever, and the deal would ensure U.S Steel would still be "controlled by the USA."
