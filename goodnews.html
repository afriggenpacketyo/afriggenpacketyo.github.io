          <p>During a game against the Detroit Tigers, Boston Red Sox outfielders Wilyer Abreu and Ceddanne Rafaela combined for an impressive 9-8 putout. Abreu leaped for a ball headed over the wall, deflecting it to Rafaela who caught it barehanded. Despite this highlight, the Red Sox lost to the Tigers, who secured a walk-off win, completing a three-game sweep. The article also mentions that the last such play happened in 2003, making this play even more of a rarity, with the article emphasizing the improbability and athletic skill involved in the play.

          <p>President Trump announced the end of U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move celebrated by Syrian business owners hoping for economic renewal after the Assad dictatorship fell. The Trump administration had previously set conditions for lifting sanctions, including assurances regarding Iran's presence and the destruction of chemical weapons. Despite the announcement, some remain concerned about the practicalities and potential political obstacles to fully removing the restrictions. The easing of sanctions could potentially unlock aid and encourage foreign investment to help rebuild the war-torn country.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining steady and lending criteria tightening, many homeowners find their home equity "trapped," meaning it's difficult to access. Elevated interest rates, stricter lending requirements, and job market uncertainty contribute to this issue. Experts recommend exploring alternative home equity borrowing options like HELOCs or home equity loans, improving credit scores, and stabilizing employment history to better access home equity. These strategies can help homeowners leverage their built-in wealth despite the challenging economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have unraveled the genetic mystery behind the distinctive orange coloration of ginger cats. Researchers discovered that ginger cats have a missing section of DNA code within the ARHGAP36 gene, which results in lighter pigment production in skin, eye, and fur cells. The study, crowdfunded by cat lovers, could help determine if orange cats are more prone to certain health conditions. The discovery also explains why ginger cats are predominantly male, linking it to the gene's location on the X chromosome.</p>
