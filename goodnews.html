          <p>Mitch Brown, a former player for the West Coast Eagles, has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his decision to retire, and he hopes his announcement will foster a safer and more inclusive environment for others. He described a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, recalling numerous homophobic comments and a conversation where a teammate expressed discomfort showering near a gay man.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket completed its tenth test flight, marking a significant comeback after a series of explosive failures earlier this year. The 400-foot vehicle successfully deployed eight mock Starlink satellites, relit its Raptor engine in orbit, and stress-tested its reusable heat shield, a critical component for Elon Musk's vision of fully reusable spacecraft. The Super Heavy booster performed a controlled splashdown, followed by the Starship in the Indian Ocean. This article highlights the flight's importance for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use Starship for crewed lunar missions, and for Musk's broader aspirations for Mars colonization, underscoring SpaceX's aggressive rapid testing approach.</p>

          <p>China's property market is exhibiting tentative signs of recovery, with major developers like China Resources Land (CR Land) and Sunac reporting improved interim financial results. CR Land saw its first-half net profit rise by 16.2% to 11.9 billion yuan, while Sunac, a large private developer, narrowed its loss by 14.4% to 12.8 billion yuan. These positive outcomes are attributed to recovering retail consumption and government stimulus measures, which have provided crucial lifelines to the industry. The article highlights that these improvements contrast sharply with the crisis mode many developers faced just a year ago, struggling with debt and tepid sales. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a remarkable 10th-century miniature figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking, depicting a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache and braided beard. Carved from walrus tusk and measuring just 1.2 inches, the artwork was discovered in Norway in 1796 but remained forgotten in the museum's archives until recently. The figure's detailed and expressive features, including a smiling countenance, stand in stark contrast to other simple Viking depictions. This article highlights the significance of the discovery for understanding Viking-Age art and challenging perceptions of Vikings as solely savage, suggesting the figure might even represent King Harald Bluetooth.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in nuclear energy development by successfully testing a new passive residual heat removal system, aiming to make its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. The China Institute of Atomic Energy confirmed this proof-of-principle test for integral fast reactors, which are central to developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with a closed-loop fuel cycle. These advanced reactors utilize high-energy neutrons and liquid metal coolants, distinguishing them from conventional thermal reactors by offering greater fuel efficiency and the ability to breed more fissile material.

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, with declines narrowing to 1.5% year-on-year, a significant improvement from steeper drops in previous months. This positive shift is attributed to Beijing's intensified campaign against "involution," or excessive competition and price wars, which had been hurting corporate profitability. While profits in the mining sector continued to fall, manufacturing and utilities saw improvements, with state-backed firms experiencing a drop, but foreign-invested and private enterprises showing profit increases. This article highlights the early effectiveness of government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and fostering healthier business conditions, even as challenges like factory-gate deflation persist.
