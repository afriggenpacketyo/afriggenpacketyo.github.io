          <p>The 50th season of ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù featured a mix of anniversary celebrations and new episodes, creating memorable moments such as political impressions, viral sketches, and standout performances. Maya Rudolph's portrayal of Vice President Harris and Jim Gaffigan's as Governor Tim Walz were deemed lackluster, while Dana Carvey's Biden and Mike Myers' Elon Musk received praise. The season also saw the unexpected viral success of a bridesmaid sketch and included a polarizing monologue by Bill Burr. The anniversary special delivered a classic ‚ÄúS.N.L.‚Äù experience, highlighted by Meryl Streep's appearance in a ‚ÄúClose Encounter‚Äù sketch. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 15:31:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform due to violations of rental regulations, as part of a broader effort to address a severe housing crisis. The government stated that the listings lacked licenses, had fake license numbers, or failed to disclose whether the property was run by a corporation or individual. Airbnb has appealed the decision. This action is part of a larger push by national, regional, and local authorities to prioritize housing rights over economic interests, amid concerns that the proliferation of tourist rentals has driven up prices and displaced residents. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having 100% home equity means the homeowner has fully paid off their mortgage or bought the home with cash, making the total value of the home theirs without owing anything to a lender. While lenders typically limit borrowing to 80%-90% of the home's value, having 100% equity positions the homeowner for better interest rates and terms. Options include home equity loans and HELOCs, with HELOCs potentially becoming more affordable if interest rates are cut later in 2025. Borrowers should carefully evaluate their affordability before borrowing, as the home will function as collateral. </p>

          <p>Country star Alan Jackson has retired from touring after more than three decades due to health issues related to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a nerve condition affecting his motor skills. Jackson, 66, concluded his final road show in Milwaukee, but plans to perform a finale show in Nashville next summer. Despite retiring from touring, Jackson hopes to continue writing and recording music. He is one of the best-selling and most-decorated acts in modern country music and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2017. </p>

          <p>Federal officials are investigating a near-miss incident at New York's LaGuardia Airport where a Republic Airways jet had to abort takeoff to avoid colliding with a United Airlines plane taxiing across the runway. Despite LaGuardia being equipped with an advanced surface radar system (ASDS-X), a miscommunication between air traffic controllers led to the close call. The FAA is taking additional steps to reduce close calls, including plans to install an additional warning system at LaGuardia in the future. Efforts are also underway to develop a system that directly warns pilots about traffic on the runway, but the FAA has not yet certified such a system. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tax relief programs can be a legitimate way to address past-due IRS debt, offering options to reduce the total amount owed, pause collection efforts, or make payments more manageable. The IRS offers several formal programs, including Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and temporary collection suspension (CNC status). However, these programs don't always mean forgiveness, and it's important to stay compliant with future tax obligations. While credit scores aren't directly impacted, consequences like liens and wage garnishments can affect financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's and DOGE's takeover and gutting of the U.S. Institute of Peace were unlawful, ordering the reinstatement of the agency's acting president and declaring DOGE's actions "null and void." The ruling cited the administration's use of force and threats to take over the USIP headquarters, even though the agency is not part of the government's executive branch. The judge stated that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania elected Nicusor Dan, a softly-spoken mathematician, as its new president, seen as a vote for change against the old political guard. Dan's election is widely seen as an act of protest against the old political guard who have governed Romania for over three decades, but it was also the least extreme option for change. His opponent, George Simion, a hard-right nationalist and Eurosceptic, made mistakes during the campaign, including controversial comments about President Macron and aggressive blog posts. For many Romanians, choosing Dan was also a strike against Moscow's meddling. </p>
