        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, argues that the pursuit of perfect motherhood is harmful and unrealistic. She explains that mothers are constantly bombarded with messages that they are not doing enough, often stemming from historical biases within the field of psychiatry that disproportionately blame mothers for their children‚Äôs problems. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to embrace their flaws, as they teach children to accept their own imperfections, and suggests that being a ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù mother is sufficient for raising well-adjusted children. She also notes the importance of mothers taking care of themselves, and encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack.</p>

Kim, a former labor activist, expressed his commitment to leading South Korea through its current crisis, while Han accepted the outcome and stepped back from political life.

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway encircling Tokyo's Ginza district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, scheduled for completion by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, also known as the "KK Line", and aims to create a tourist attraction modeled after New York City's High Line. The project, estimated to cost 14 billion yen, will include soil and plant life, rest areas, event spaces, cafes, and food trucks.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' perfect record against former Cy Young Award winners ended with a 3-0 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, despite a strong pitching performance from Dustin May. Corbin Burnes of the Diamondbacks pitched seven shutout innings, reversing the Dodgers' previous success against elite pitchers. Freddie Freeman acknowledged Burnes' skill, highlighting the difficulty in hitting his cutter. This loss also continued a troubling trend for the Dodgers, who have struggled against teams with winning records.</p>

          <p>Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, speaking at a town hall in Pennsylvania, encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as a "big tent" party. Gallego suggested that the party had become too exclusive and had alienated potential supporters, citing Joe Rogan as an example. Gallego, who won his Senate race in Arizona, a state with more registered Republicans than Democrats, emphasized the need to build alliances with people they may not agree with 100% of the time. He also stated that Democrats need to empathize with voters and address their economic concerns.</p>

          <p>As global uncertainties rise, China is diversifying its imported food sources, with Southeast Asian neighbors becoming viable suppliers. Yunnan, a Chinese province bordering Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam, is playing a key role in regional agricultural cooperation. Through the "alternative crop cultivation programme," Yunnan shares agricultural technology and promotes sustainable economic alternatives to reduce opium production. With China's growing demand for agricultural products and limited farmland, overseas cooperation is an effective way to diversify food supplies.</p>
