          <p>High-speed trains between Cologne and Berlin have been canceled for two weeks due to upgrades at Cologne railway station, a major European transport hub serving around 180,000 passengers daily. Network operator Deutsche Bahn is installing a new electronic signal box until May 19, causing disruptions to several regional and suburban railway lines. Trains to Brussels are being diverted via Krefeld, while services connecting Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne will operate normally. The upgrade impacts connections to Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Austria, affecting six regional express lines and suburban routes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The study involved 800 participants across 37 countries who received weekly semaglutide injections or a placebo. After 72 weeks, 62.9% of the semaglutide group showed less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also experienced improvements in liver fibrosis, liver enzymes, and weight loss, though some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common.

          <h2>Evangelical Churches Gain Ground as Catholic Church Declines in Latin America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Catholic Church is experiencing a decline in Latin America, with a significant shift towards evangelical churches. In Lima, Peru, evangelical services attract thousands, contrasting sharply with dwindling attendance in Catholic churches. A Pew Research Center study indicates that only 69% of Latin Americans identified as Catholic in 2013, down from 94% in the 1950s. This trend is attributed to rapid social changes, rural-to-urban migration, and changing attitudes on social issues, with evangelical churches offering a more direct and charismatic approach that resonates with the working and lower middle classes.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested Amazon swamp after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, said the plane lost altitude and he was forced to land near the Itanomas River. The survivors stood on top of the plane, surrounded by alligators, and ate cassava flour brought by one of the passengers. Local fishermen discovered the craft, leading to a helicopter rescue. The survivors were taken to the hospital in "excellent condition."</p>

          <h2>Assisted Dying Could Result in Over 4,000 Deaths Annually in England and Wales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 03:56:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of assisted dying policy in England and Wales suggests that assisted deaths could exceed 4,000 in the 10th year after the law's implementation, should MPs vote in favor. The impact assessment estimates the total number of assisted deaths could range from 164 to 787 in the first half-year to between 1,042 and 4,559 in year 10, assuming the policy starts in October 2029. While the NHS could see savings from reduced healthcare costs, staffing and training an assisted dying service could cost over ¬£10 million a year within a decade. The Department of Health and Social Care remains neutral on the issue.</p>

          <p>BBC News reporter Nada Tawfik shares her impressions of interviewing Prince Harry, describing him as down-to-earth, softly spoken, and easy to talk to. The interview took place in Santa Barbara, California, following Prince Harry's loss in a legal challenge over his security in the UK. Tawfik notes that Prince Harry was eager to share his feelings despite the scrutiny he faces, addressing questions about taxpayer-funded security and his concerns about the safety of his family in the UK. She emphasizes the importance of giving him space to share his perspective on these complex issues.</p>

          <h2>Man's Snake Venom Injections Lead to 'Unparalleled' Antivenom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 02:29:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snake species. This could lead to a universal antivenom, which is significant because current therapies must match the specific snake species. The research identified two broadly neutralising antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxin, offering protection against 13 of 19 deadly elapid species in mice experiments.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency, which had risen above its trading band against the U.S. dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts may be discussed, potentially leading to more capital inflows into Hong Kong. The HKMA will continue monitoring the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>
