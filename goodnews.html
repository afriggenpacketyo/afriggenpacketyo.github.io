          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother and bank manager, was kidnapped with her daughter and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to them, demanding she steal money from the vault, leading to a terrifying ordeal. After the crime, Michelle was initially treated as a suspect, with investigators scrutinizing her past, including her previous work as a stripper, and financial difficulties. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, defense attorneys attacked her credibility during the trial of the kidnappers, painting her as a criminal, but the real perpetrators were eventually convicted, and Michelle and her daughter have since become advocates for trauma survivors, sharing their story of resilience.</p>

          <p>Shanghai's high-end property market is bucking the national downturn, with luxury units selling quickly as wealthy buyers seek value-preserving assets. A luxury development in the Huangpu district, One Central Park, sold all 64 units for 4 billion yuan, averaging 185,000 yuan per square meter. The project's year-to-date sales have exceeded 10.8 billion yuan, making it the first residential project in China to surpass 10 billion yuan in 2025. New home prices in Shanghai have risen, outpacing national averages, with premium projects like Lujiazui Taikoo Yuan Residences and Symphony Shanghai selling out rapidly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yosemite National Park's Tioga Road, a scenic section of Highway 120, will reopen on Memorial Day after being closed since November due to ice and snow.

Visitors entering the park between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend will need a reservation and should expect delays, and staffing shortages are anticipated due to cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's two-run double in the fourth inning proved decisive as the New York Mets defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-2. The Dodgers' pitcher, Tony Gonsolin, struggled with command, issuing consecutive walks that loaded the bases before Soto's hit, which highlighted the team's reliance on their starting pitchers due to an overworked bullpen. Mets starter David Peterson delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ‚Öî innings and limiting the Dodgers' offense. The Dodgers' manager, Dave Roberts, acknowledged the lack of offensive energy and the need for improved production from the team's starters.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions due to increasing competition for talent as Japanese cuisine becomes more popular worldwide. The new scheme, starting in January, will offer annual salaries of over 6 million yen, up from the current 4 to 4.5 million yen. Chefs will also be allowed to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government, and the aim is to promote Japanese food more proactively, recognizing the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the service now under public ownership. The government hails the move as a "new dawn for rail" but stops short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on improving services and reinvesting profits in infrastructure. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the opposition Conservatives urge Labour to deliver on its promises. The nationalized service will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, with the first service bearing the new GBR livery.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and eliminate the two-child benefit cap if the party assumes power. These commitments, aimed at highlighting divisions within the Labour party, would be funded by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The announcement follows pressure on Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to address cuts to winter fuel payments and calls for the removal of the two-child benefit cap, a policy introduced in 2017 that restricts benefits for families with more than two children.</p>

Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, and the city has made efforts to improve lifeguard stations and recruitment processes, including holding qualifying exams in multiple boroughs.</p>
