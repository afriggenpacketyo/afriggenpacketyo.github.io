          <p>The Smithsonian has announced it will update its "American Presidency" exhibit at the National Museum of American History to reflect all presidential impeachments, including both of Donald Trump's. The decision follows public reporting that a temporary placard referencing Trump's impeachments had been removed in July. The museum stated the removal was due to the placard not meeting display standards and was not influenced by any government officials. The updated exhibit will be installed in the coming weeks to provide a complete historical account of all U.S. presidents who have faced impeachment proceedings.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The tremor was felt across parts of the New York City area, including as far as Connecticut, though no damage or injuries were reported. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause damage. The event follows a much larger, and rare, 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity, while infrequent, does occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with payouts expected to be under £950 per deal. The plan follows a Supreme Court ruling that found extremely high, undisclosed commissions from lenders to dealers could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the scheme's details, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The industry is expected to cover all costs, though concerns exist about the availability of historical data. (not investment advice)</p>

These spicy items are often low-cost, high-return additions that can generate buzz on social media platforms like TikTok. While the trend is currently popular, restaurants face the challenge of keeping up with rapidly changing tastes, as interest in specific flavor profiles can wane quickly.</p>

          <p>China has granted export licenses to 183 additional Brazilian coffee companies, a move that provides a significant alternative market for Brazil's coffee producers. This development comes shortly after the United States announced a steep 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee and other goods. While the U.S. has historically been a much larger market for Brazilian coffee, the new tariffs present a major challenge for exporters. The approval from China, Brazil's top overall trade partner, signals a potential shift in global coffee trade dynamics and offers a crucial lifeline for the affected Brazilian businesses.</p>

          <p>Recent footage aired on Chinese state television appears to show the country's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, conducting its first test of an electromagnetic catapult system. The short video clip, part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary, shows a control room operator clearing a position for take-off. This event marks a critical milestone for the Fujian, which is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, similar to that used by the U.S. Navy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce lawyers advise that individuals in a potentially rocky marriage can take steps to protect their finances. The first recommendation is to gain full awareness of all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities while still married, as access is easier. The second strategy is to consider a postnuptial agreement, which defines how assets, particularly business assets acquired during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. While potentially a difficult conversation, these measures can provide security and clarity for both partners should the marriage end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Calm Children's Tantrums</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 09:57:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests using specific calming phrases to handle children's tantrums effectively. Instead of punishment, the approach focuses on connection and validation, recognizing that a tantrum is a sign of nervous system distress. Phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" help a child feel safe and understood. This method aims to de-escalate the situation by reassuring the child, setting compassionate boundaries, and building trust, which can reduce the frequency and intensity of future meltdowns.</p>
