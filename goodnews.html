          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Nvidia CEO's Criticism of China AI Chip Export Controls Misses the Mark</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An op-ed challenges Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's claim that U.S. export controls on AI chips are a "failure" that spurred Chinese innovation. The author argues that China's efforts to achieve tech independence predate the 2022 restrictions and are driven by national security concerns. The controls aim to prevent advanced chips from fueling the modernization of the People's Liberation Army. Despite Huang's warnings, Nvidia's success has continued, with data center revenue jumping significantly, and the real risk lies in disrupting the policies' momentum. The author argues that U.S. semiconductor policy is about protecting America's strategic edge, not Nvidia's market share in China.</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month, following a pause caused by trade tensions. This development indicates a positive shift in trade relations and is expected to boost Boeing's production. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its Dreamliner planes, but the company anticipates recouping much of these costs upon exporting the finished aircraft. Ortberg mentioned that China had previously indicated a pause in deliveries, but has since reversed that decision.</p>

          <p>A U.S. trade court has ruled President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imported goods illegal, creating uncertainty for U.S. businesses and consumers. The ruling halts tariffs assessed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), but other tariffs remain in effect. The Trump administration intends to appeal the ruling, and could also seek alternate routes to deploy additional tariffs. The effective tariff rate is currently 6.5%, higher than before the Trump administration, but lower than anticipated had the IEEPA-related tariffs remained.</p>

While long-term CDs typically offer higher APYs, short-term CDs are currently providing the most competitive interest rates. A CD ladder strategy, involving investments in CDs with varying maturity dates, is recommended to maximize returns and manage liquidity. Experts advise individuals to consider their financial goals, emergency funds, and potential need for funds before the CD term ends when making a decision.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has sided with a Utah railway project intended to transport crude oil, limiting the scope of environmental impact reviews required for federal agencies. The 8-0 ruling overturned a lower court decision that had halted the project, stating that agencies need only consider the environmental effects of the project at hand, not potential future or geographically separate projects. Justice Kavanaugh wrote that the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a procedural cross-check, not a substantive roadblock.

          <p>A $335 million plan to renovate Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center aims to open the park to a neighborhood it has long walled off. The renovation seeks to rectify an approach to city building from the bad old days of urban renewal. The project includes a new amphitheater, tiered gardens, and a pool, responding to community desires. The renovation also acknowledges the history of the area, which was once a vibrant neighborhood that was demolished to make way for Lincoln Center.</p>

          <p>Stock markets rose on Thursday following a U.S. court decision blocking President Trump's sweeping tariffs, with the S&P 500 index increasing by 0.8 percent in early trading. Investors were encouraged by the possibility of a slowdown in the trade war, although the ruling is subject to appeal. Nvidia, the chip giant, also contributed to the market's positive performance after reporting strong earnings growth, suggesting the tech industry's embrace of artificial intelligence has room to run.</p>
