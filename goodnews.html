        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated that President Trump's executive order limiting birthright citizenship violates four Supreme Court precedents during a hearing where the Solicitor General argued against federal district court judges issuing national injunctions. Justice Kagan questioned how the Supreme Court could rule on the order's constitutionality if district court judges could not issue injunctions, with Sotomayor and Kagan pressing the Solicitor General on the legality of Trump's order. Trump defended his order on social media, stating that birthright citizenship was not intended for vacationers. This case highlights the ongoing legal battles over Trump's executive orders and their potential impact on constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that the UK economy is "beginning to turn a corner" after stronger-than-expected growth of 0.7% in the first three months of the year. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending and business investment, but analysts warned that the strong rate is unlikely to continue due to upcoming US tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. The Labour government has made boosting the economy a top priority, but its decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has faced criticism from businesses. This article examines the implications of the latest economic data and the challenges facing the UK economy.</p>
