          <h2>Study Reveals Tipping Habits Vary Significantly Across U.S. States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 13:49:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent LendingTree study reveals significant variations in tipping rates across U.S. states, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most and Utah residents tipping the least. The analysis suggests that tipping rates correlate with the frequency of dining out in each state. The study also indicates that East Coast residents generally tip more, while those in the South and Western U.S. tip less. This comes as spending at restaurants and bars has increased, representing a larger portion of Americans' food budgets. The findings highlight the role of tipping in supplementing the income of service workers, particularly given the federal minimum wage for tipped workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago at Boston's Logan Airport went off the runway and onto the grass on Thursday morning, with no injuries reported. The Airbus A220 experienced a steering issue upon landing, according to air traffic control transmissions. Passengers were safely deplaned using stairs and transported to the terminal by bus. The incident led to the temporary closure of runway 33-L and caused ground delays averaging nearly two hours at the airport. The incident is under investigation to determine the cause of the steering malfunction.</p>

          <p>Costco is now offering early access to its warehouses for Executive Members, who can enter stores at 9 a.m., an hour before Gold Star members. This new perk follows the extension of hours at Costco gas stations, which has received positive customer feedback. Executive Members, who pay $130 annually, account for a significant portion of Costco's sales, despite representing a smaller percentage of the company's total memberships. Costco raised the price of both Executive and Gold Star memberships last year, enhancing the value proposition for its higher-tier subscribers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that innocent victims of wrong-house raids by federal law enforcement can sue for compensation for emotional and physical harm. The decision revives a lawsuit by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017. The court unanimously held that the Federal Tort Claims Act permits suits for such abuses, confirming an exception to legal immunity that typically protects the government. Justice Gorsuch noted that Congress has opened the door to liability when officers commit assault, battery, or abuse of process. The ruling is seen as a victory for accountability and justice.</p>

The 14-year-old boy was taken from London to Ghana in March 2024 after being told a relative was ill, but his parents wanted to get him out of London as they feared he was being drawn into criminal activity. He won a Court of Appeal bid, so the case will be reheard, with Sir Andrew McFarlane saying there had been confusion in the previous decision.
