          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, made their first official public appearance since the summer break, visiting the Natural History Museum gardens. As patron of the museum, Catherine, accompanied by William, explored the gardens which serve both recreational and scientific purposes. The visit follows a challenging 18 months for the royal couple, including Catherine's cancer diagnosis, and coincides with their children's return to school. The Princess has previously emphasized the importance of children engaging with nature and has been involved in creating nature-focused initiatives.</p>

          <p>Figma, the design software company, saw its shares drop 14% in extended trading after releasing its inaugural earnings report since going public in July. The company reported revenue of $249.6 million, slightly above expectations, with a net income of $846,000. However, concerns about slowing revenue growth for the third quarter, partly attributed to the success of its Dev Mode product, impacted investor sentiment. Figma also announced new AI-powered design tools and recent acquisitions, emphasizing that AI will enhance designers' roles rather than displace them. Despite a strong net retention rate, the stock's performance reflects market adjustments post-IPO and ahead of a significant share sale lockup expiry.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion after no winner emerged from the latest drawing, making it the fifth-largest in the lottery's history. This article analyzes Powerball data, revealing the best and worst states for winners due to varying state income taxes on prizes, in addition to federal withholdings. States like California and Florida impose no state tax, allowing winners to retain significantly more of their prize, while others like New York have the lowest after-tax payouts. The analysis also covers the odds of winning and the most frequently drawn numbers, providing context for the popular lottery phenomenon.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants NFL franchise has agreed to sell a 10% minority stake to Julia Koch and her family for over $1 billion, valuing the team at a record-breaking $10 billion for a sports organization. This transaction, awaiting NFL owner approval, will slightly reduce the Mara and Tisch families' holdings but keeps John Mara as president. The deal signifies a further expansion of the Koch family's investment in New York professional sports, following their acquisition of a stake in BSE Global, parent company of the Brooklyn Nets, last year. This landmark sale underscores the surging valuations of American sports franchises. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts believe China's use of AI in military technology and its affordable systems could position it as a major player alongside the U.S. in the future arms market. However, geopolitical ties to the U.S. pose a challenge for China in penetrating certain markets. This display underscores China's growing military capabilities and its strategic efforts to expand its influence on the international stage through defense technology sales.</p>

          <p>WNBA All-Star Angel Reese issued an apology to her Chicago Sky teammates after publicly expressing frustrations about the team's performance and future, suggesting she might seek opportunities elsewhere if improvements aren't made.

          <p>The peace sign, or V-sign, has become a ubiquitous photo pose among Gen Z and Gen Alpha children, surpassing older gestures like bunny ears. This article explores the cultural origins and modern prevalence of the gesture, noting its shift from a symbol of victory or anti-war protest to a general sign of cuteness. Experts suggest the influence of Japanese pop culture, particularly anime's 'kawaii' aesthetic, plays a significant role in its current popularity. Beyond specific meaning, children use it as a natural way to pose, providing something to do with their hands in an era of constant photography and strategic self-presentation.</p>

          <p>A Sydney daycare center is under investigation after a grandfather mistakenly took home the wrong one-year-old child from First Steps Learning Academy. The error became apparent when the child's mother arrived to find her son missing, leading to immediate alarm. The grandfather's wife stated he was "devastated" upon realizing the mistake and quickly returned the child. The daycare has stood down the involved educator and implemented strengthened procedures, apologizing for the "deeply upsetting and isolated incident." This event highlights heightened concerns about childcare safety standards in Australia, with new legislative changes recently announced to address such issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration acted unlawfully by freezing over $2 billion in research funds for Harvard University. The administration had claimed the freeze was in response to antisemitism on campus, but Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the action. Judge Allison D. Burroughs' ruling cited that the freeze was implemented without considering Harvard's existing steps to address antisemitism and violated the university's First Amendment rights. The judge noted the defunded research, which included studies on Alzheimer's and heart disease, had no clear connection to campus antisemitism, strengthening Harvard's position in the ongoing dispute.</p>

          <p>British luxury fashion house Burberry is slated to return to the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index this month, a year after its relegation from the blue-chip benchmark. This upgrade reflects the early successes of a comprehensive overhaul strategy led by CEO Joshua Schulman. Burberry's shares had fallen significantly but showed signs of recovery with a better-than-expected 1% decline in first-quarter sales, driven by upticks in U.S. and European markets. Schulman's strategy focuses on embracing Burberry's iconic pieces and implementing cost-cutting measures, aiming for £80 million in annualized savings by fiscal year 2026, signaling renewed investor confidence in the brand's turnaround.

          <p>Democrats have successfully brokered an agreement to protect the voting rights of approximately 98,000 North Carolina residents, thwarting a Trump administration attempt to restrict them. The Justice Department had sued the state's board of elections, demanding that individuals who provided only partial identification information during registration be prevented from voting. The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups intervened, arguing the demand violated the National Voter Registration Act and was politically motivated. Under the new terms, these voters can still cast provisional ballots, ensuring their participation in upcoming elections and upholding voter access.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that most Americans believe Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are diminishing vaccine availability, despite a strong public desire for greater access. The survey reveals a broad consensus that government policy should encourage childhood vaccinations for diseases like measles and polio, a view shared across party lines. Public trust in the FDA and CDC for vaccine safety information remains higher among Democrats than Republicans, while Americans overwhelmingly trust their personal doctors. The poll highlights a net-negative job approval for Kennedy, with public perception of his vaccine stance strongly influencing overall approval ratings. (not investment advice)</p>
