          <p>A proposed $100,000 fee for H-1B visas under the Trump administration could inadvertently position the Middle East as a significant beneficiary in the global competition for AI talent. Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are actively implementing technology-focused national strategies and offering highly competitive compensation, tax-friendly environments, and long-term "golden visas" to attract skilled professionals. This approach contrasts with the U.S. and Europe, where immigration policies are seen as less welcoming, potentially driving expertise to the Middle East. While the region presents unique, large-scale opportunities in AI-driven urban development, concerns persist regarding the lack of clear pathways to citizenship and regional stability.

          <p>Swiss citizens are heading to the polls for a second referendum to determine the fate of electronic identity cards, after a previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to data protection worries. The current, revised plan addresses these concerns by ensuring the system is completely optional, publicly managed, and stores user data locally on smartphones rather than in a central database. Proponents highlight the system's potential to simplify online bureaucratic tasks, from obtaining phone contracts to age verification, significantly enhancing convenience. While Switzerland has a robust history of safeguarding privacy, recent public acceptance of a COVID ID and prevalent social media usage indicate a potential shift in voter sentiment towards embracing government-backed digital identification.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's manager, Eddie Howe, is facing scrutiny over his team's significant struggles with set-pieces, despite boasting a physically imposing squad and having recently hired a specialist coach. The club has scored only one goal from dead-ball situations this season, a stark underperformance compared to their previous effectiveness and the league-leading Arsenal, who excel in this area. Howe acknowledges the need for improvement, stressing that while the players and delivery are present, tactical execution is not "clicking." The article underscores the critical importance of set-plays in modern football, noting Newcastle's past success in this domain, and highlights the urgent need to rectify these issues ahead of their crucial match.</p>

Key offensive players, including Max Muncy and Will Smith, are battling injuries, casting doubt on their readiness for the postseason opener, while utilityman Tommy Edman is limited to designated hitter duties. Manager Dave Roberts is navigating complex decisions regarding the pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, which features a potential overabundance of left-handers and strategic options like utilizing Tyler Glasnow in relief. The team also needs to finalize its starting rotation, with Shohei Ohtani being a strong candidate for Game 1, balancing his dual role as pitcher and hitter.</p>

This historical event, which resulted in the deaths of 28 Chinese people and injuries to 14 others during labor disputes, is now being brought to light through archaeological research and a new bronze statue, 'Requiem.' The town's increased focus on acknowledging this anti-immigrant history is notable, especially as its mayor, a Republican, voices concerns over contemporary anti-immigrant stances despite his political affiliations. This initiative aims to educate residents and descendants about the past while grappling with current immigration debates.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, has voiced optimism about his government's ability to "pull this round" as the party prepares for its annual conference, aiming to regain public support. With Labour reportedly trailing Reform UK in opinion polls and facing leadership speculation, Starmer emphasized a need to "roll up our sleeves." He also intensified his criticism of Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, accusing his party of divisive policies that would "tear this country apart," particularly concerning their proposed changes to indefinite leave to remain for migrants. The conference is positioned as an opportunity for Labour to present a unifying alternative to what Starmer describes as "toxic divide and decline."</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has responded with equanimity to the news of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway completely divesting its stake in the company, calling the selling "completely normal." BYD acknowledged Berkshire's 17-year investment and profit-taking, even as BYD shares saw a dip and the company cut its 2025 sales target. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway is actively expanding its investments in Japanese "trading house" stocks, with its holdings in Mitsui and Mitsubishi now exceeding 10%. This strategic shift indicates Berkshire's continued global investment activities, moving from a successful long-term Chinese venture to increasing its presence in the Japanese market.

          <p>Singer Florence Welch has publicly revealed that she underwent life-saving emergency surgery in August 2023 after suffering a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy. The Grammy-nominated artist shared that she was unknowingly performing on stage with severe internal bleeding, describing the experience as the "closest I came to death." Diagnosed following a miscarriage, the critical condition necessitated immediate surgical intervention to remove her fallopian tube. Welch had previously canceled scheduled concerts, citing undisclosed personal reasons, and is now preparing for the October release of her new album, "Everybody Scream," having successfully recovered from the harrowing and life-threatening medical emergency.</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George E. Hardy, the last surviving Tuskegee Airman to have flown combat missions during World War II in Europe, has passed away at the age of 100.

As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he completed 21 missions in WWII, followed by 45 in Korea and 70 in Vietnam. Despite receiving numerous military honors, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Hardy often cited his educational achievements as his proudest accomplishment. His death signifies the end of an era for these pioneering Black aviators who courageously challenged and overcame racial barriers within the U.S. Armed Forces.</p>

Deputy Director Yu Jian confirmed that the institution will extensively promote digital exhibitions, high-quality replicas, and photographic displays for presentation in museums around the world. This forward-thinking approach will enable a broader international audience to engage with the rich cultural heritage of Sanxingdui, offering unique insights even without the physical presence of the original, irreplaceable pieces.</p>

          <p>Europe has established a commanding 11½-4½ lead over the United States in the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, moving within three points of an away victory. The day was marked by hostile fan behavior, with European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, subjected to personal insults and disruptive shouts. Captain Luke Donald condemned the "crossing the line" conduct, which included an MC joining an abusive chant. Despite the challenging atmosphere, McIlroy and Lowry secured a vital fourballs win, allowing Europe to maintain composure and let their golf performance speak for itself, silencing the New York crowd and edging closer to victory.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has successfully cultivated and is now preparing to harvest its first commercial rice crop, a pioneering experiment driven by a record-hot summer and the imperatives of climate change adaptation. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas, the UK's only rice-grower, is overseeing trials of nine different rice varieties in Cambridgeshire, with several strains showing promising results. This innovative project, a collaboration with the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production strategies and address climate change by re-wetting peat soils to sequester greenhouse gases. While widespread commercial cultivation is still some time away, this initiative signals a potential transformative shift in British agriculture, adapting to evolving climatic conditions and contributing to environmental solutions.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been honored with an Ig Nobel Prize for their unique and inventive study exploring how foul-smelling shoes influence the user experience of a shoe rack. Their research, initiated by observations in university hostels, scientifically investigated the origins of shoe odor, pinpointing the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the primary cause. This led them to develop a prototype for a shoe rack integrated with UVC light, capable of effectively sterilizing footwear and eliminating unpleasant smells within minutes. This delightfully unconventional scientific endeavor, which meticulously measured odor levels and optimal UVC exposure, garnered recognition from the Ig Nobel committee for its ability to both amuse and provoke thought.</p>
