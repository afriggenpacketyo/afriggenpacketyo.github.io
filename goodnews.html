          <p>Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and European nations to offer Ukraine "Article 5-like" security guarantees. This development, described as a significant concession, emerged from the recent summit between the U.S. and Russian presidents. NATO's Article 5 is a collective defense clause, and such a guarantee for Ukraine has been a key objective to ensure its long-term security and bring an end to the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a specific rule regarding attacking players in a defensive wall. According to the International Football Association Board's Law 13, when three or more defenders form a wall, all attacking players must be at least one meter away from it. The referee announced that a Palace player had violated this distance, resulting in the goal being overturned and an indirect free-kick awarded to Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board mandated that staff return to work, and the Minister of Jobs ordered binding arbitration to resolve the dispute over salaries and working conditions. The union, which is seeking higher pay and compensation for ground time, accused the government of "caving to corporate pressure" and undermining workers' rights.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party destination after a challenging five-year renovation. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and invested significantly to make it habitable, overcoming logistical hurdles like having no running water or electricity. Now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and a nightclub, the historic fort that once protected Milford Haven is back on the market for £3 million.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her positive mindset and successful recovery from a major ACL injury to the practice of creating vision boards. Encouraged by a teammate, Brink used collages of her goals—like making the Olympics and being an All-Star—and personal aspirations to stay focused during her 13-month rehabilitation. This visualization technique helped her manage the mental strain of recovery, allowing her to return to the court with a renewed perspective focused on enjoying the game rather than immediate statistical success.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County for two days. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, a search team located him using a drone and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety.</p>
