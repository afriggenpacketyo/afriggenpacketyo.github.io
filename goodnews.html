          <p>A 5.3-magnitude earthquake struck a rural area of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico on Saturday night, with the epicenter located about 35 miles south of Whites City, New Mexico. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 3.9 miles and was felt by many residents, but there were no immediate reports of damage. The USGS received over 800 public responses through its Felt Report feature. This earthquake follows a 5.2-magnitude earthquake that hit San Diego County in April, which seismologists linked to a branch of the San Andreas Fault system.</p>

          <p>Members of the South Texas community of Boca Chica, home to SpaceX's rocket launch facilities, voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase. The vote, tallied at 212 to 6, fulfills Elon Musk's long-held ambition to create a city centered around his company's operations. The community, covering about 1.5 square miles, will now be eligible to create its own police and fire departments, adopt ordinances, and apply for state and federal grants. Musk has frequently referred to the area as Starbase on his social media platform, X, and has expressed his commitment to the project.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports on a China Coast Guard helicopter violating Japanese airspace near the Senkaku Islands, marking the fourth such intrusion. The digest also notes Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's commitment to revising Japan's pacifist Constitution, though momentum for the move remains low. Other headlines include Japan's insistence on reviewing all tariffs for a trade deal with the U.S., the Australian Labor Party's election victory, and the South Korean conservatives' presidential pick.</p>

          <p>Sovereignty won the 151st Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs, prevailing over a field of 18 other horses in wet conditions. The horse, with 5-1 odds, outperformed Journalism, who was the heavy favorite. The victory secured $3.1 million for Sovereignty's team, and was jockey Junior Alvarado's first Kentucky Derby win. The article also mentions that this was Bob Baffert's return after serving a three-year suspension by Churchill Downs after Medina Spirit crossed the finish line first in 2021 and failed a postrace drug test.</p>
