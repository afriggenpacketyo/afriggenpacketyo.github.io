          <p>Manchester United has reached an agreement with Wolves to sign Brazilian striker Matheus Cunha for ¬£62.5 million. The 26-year-old forward is expected to sign a five-year deal with an option for an additional year at Old Trafford. Cunha, who has scored 31 goals in 76 appearances for Wolves since 2023, will undergo visa approval and registration procedures before officially joining the club after his international duty with Brazil.

          <p>Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) Chair Rep. Suzan DelBene asserts that Democrats are "on offense" in the 2026 battle to regain the House majority, citing public outrage and the need for representatives who will fight for their communities. DelBene highlights the 35 districts in play and emphasizes that Democrats only need three more seats to take back the majority. Despite historical trends favoring the party out of power in midterm elections, the current political map appears to favor Republicans, but DelBene remains confident that the party's focus on important issues will lead to success. The Democrats are facing a polling dilemma because the party's ratings have been sinking to historic lows in a number of national surveys so far this year.</p>

          <p>An anthropologist recounts travels across the United States, engaging in conversations with people holding differing views to understand the deep rifts in American culture. Encounters ranged from a gated community emphasizing self-defense to a white nationalist rally in Tennessee, where a man expressed a belief that one cannot live alongside others unlike oneself. The anthropologist also highlights the Denton Women‚Äôs Interracial Fellowship in Texas, which worked to desegregate their town and support Black families. The author argues for the importance of neighborliness and collective belonging, especially in a world where relationships span the globe, and the consequences of how we live extend to many distant and unseen places.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist outlines six daily practices to build trust with children, emphasizing the importance of open communication and emotional honesty. These practices include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling rather than interrogating, integrating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies. The author emphasizes that trust is built through small, consistent moments and by creating a safe space for children to express themselves. The author encourages parents to be present and willing to share their own experiences to foster a deeper connection with their children.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations in low visibility conditions, although some critics argue that night vision devices are more practical and powerful.</p>

The study verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Researchers found that approximately 20 percent of the genetic composition of Tibetan Plateau populations originates from this previously unknown source. The findings fill a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>A review of the French series "Reformed" on Max discusses how the show explores the challenges of making religion relevant in a secular world through the character of Rabbi L√©a Schmoll. L√©a, a young and somewhat unconventional rabbi, struggles to balance the demands of tradition with the realities of modern life. The show examines the tension between liberal and Orthodox interpretations of Judaism, highlighting the importance of interpretation and the search for meaning in religious rituals. The show ultimately suggests that religion can still have purpose for non-believers, as long as it is never too sure of itself.</p>
