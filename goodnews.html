          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that nonfarm payrolls increased by 139,000 in May, surpassing estimates. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, while average hourly earnings rose by 0.4% for the month and 3.9% year-over-year, exceeding forecasts. Healthcare led job growth, adding 62,000 positions, while leisure and hospitality contributed 48,000. Despite these positive figures, downward revisions to previous months and disparities between establishment and household surveys indicate underlying economic concerns. (not investment advice) The overall figures suggest a degree of resilience in the labor market despite some potential warning signs. </p>

          <p>According to a Labor Department report, hiring slowed in May, with employers adding 139,000 jobs, a decrease from the previous month. Job gains in March and April were also revised downward. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, but the workforce decreased by 625,000 people. Federal government job cuts contributed to the slowdown, while factories also experienced job losses, partly attributed to the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the manufacturing sector. Average wages increased by 3.9% year-over-year, potentially outpacing price increases.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident, who faces deportation after participating in an anti-Israel demonstration. The judge's order restricts Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from arresting Chung without prior court approval, ensuring her freedom while her legal case proceeds. Chung's attorneys argue that the government's actions infringe upon her First Amendment rights. The Trump administration contends that her protest involvement poses adverse foreign policy implications for the U.S., while Chung's legal team asserts she was merely a participant expressing shared concerns over the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its interest rates to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling a decrease in inflation pressures. The decision comes after the inflation rate dropped to 6.2% in April, down from an average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. Despite this, the central bank emphasizes that monetary policy will remain tight to achieve its 4% inflation target. Russia's economy has faced significant strain due to its invasion of Ukraine and subsequent economic re-orientation, with GDP growth slowing in the first quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hiring in the U.S. slowed in May, with 139,000 jobs added, as businesses expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies.

The job market's performance comes as Trump rolled back some "Liberation Day" tariffs following a trade agreement with China, although concerns remain about the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and economic activity.

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft following a public fallout with President Trump, who threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. Musk's announcement came after Trump criticized Musk's opposition to his tax and spending bill. However, Musk later reversed his decision, stating that the Dragon spacecraft would not be decommissioned after receiving advice to "cool down." NASA relies on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS), making the initial threat a significant concern for space operations.</p>

Musk's role as head of the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency concluded last week, contributing to the recent volatility.</p>
