          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of repairs to address landslide and coastal erosion risks. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction to stabilize the tracks, involving the placement of thousands of tons of boulders and cubic yards of sand. The Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) estimates the total cost of the projects at approximately $300 million. The OCTA acknowledged the frequent interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs, which have disrupted operations for over 125 years.</p>

Despite Trump's tariffs, Asian equities have outperformed, making Chinese and Hong Kong stocks attractive for diversification. With compelling valuations and falling interest rates in the region, the case for shifting away from expensive US equities is growing stronger. This trend is supported by the recent agreement between Washington and Beijing to reduce tariffs, signaling potential for broader deals and easing geopolitical risks. (not investment advice)</p>
