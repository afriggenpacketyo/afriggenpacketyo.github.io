          <p>As Americans face record credit card debt, debt management programs offer a solution for those seeking to regain financial control without taking on new loans. To qualify, individuals generally need to meet three main criteria: a steady and sufficient income, a manageable amount of unsecured debt within program limits, and a strong commitment to the program's rules. These requirements ensure that participants can make consistent payments and are prepared for the lifestyle changes necessary for success, such as closing credit accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pete DeJoy, the newly appointed interim CEO of tech startup Astronomer, has made his first public statement, aiming to move the company beyond a recent viral controversy. The previous CEO, Andy Byron, resigned after a video showed him in an intimate moment with the company's head of human resources at a concert. DeJoy acknowledged the "unusual and surreal" media attention and emphasized his commitment to the company's mission, employees, and customers as Astronomer begins its search for a permanent leader.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has directed the withdrawal of the 700 U.S. Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles in early June amidst federal immigration raids and protests.

          <p>With rising college costs, many students rely on federal loans, but these come with specific borrowing limits designed to prevent excessive debt. The maximum amount a student can borrow depends on factors like their dependency status, year in school, and whether they are an undergraduate or graduate student. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while the aggregate lifetime limit for undergraduates is $31,000. These caps often mean students must seek additional funding, like private loans, to cover the full cost of attendance. (not investment advice)</p>
