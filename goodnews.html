          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a landmark $1.5 billion settlement between AI startup Anthropic and a group of authors in a copyright infringement lawsuit. The authors alleged that Anthropic illegally used their books, obtained from pirated databases like Library Genesis, to train its AI models. This settlement, the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history, mandates Anthropic to pay approximately $3,000 per book plus interest and destroy the infringing datasets. The article underscores the growing legal challenges faced by AI companies regarding intellectual property and sets a significant precedent for defining copyright infringement in the artificial intelligence era.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that critics are overlooking the robust and diversified nature of China's economic transition, which extends beyond short-term challenges like a cooling property market. The article asserts that China's economy is being strengthened by synergistic investments in green infrastructure, digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. China has emerged as a global leader in scientific research, producing 33.8% of the world’s highly cited papers and leading in 57 out of 64 key technologies, including artificial intelligence and renewable energy. This strategic shift is cultivating a more well-rounded and sustainable economic foundation, moving away from reliance on a single source of growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco reported robust fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, surpassing analyst expectations, driven by double-digit growth in both membership income and e-commerce sales. The warehouse club is successfully attracting younger shoppers, with nearly half of its new sign-ups coming from individuals under 40, leading to a decrease in the average member age. The article notes that Costco's diversified sales, primarily groceries, and its "treasure hunt" shopping experience position it well to manage economic challenges like higher tariffs, with the company taking steps to reduce related costs. This strong performance follows a recent increase in membership fees, further boosting its overall revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order facilitating a deal for TikTok to operate under a new corporate structure, avoiding a U.S. ban and extending enforcement by 120 days. The agreement, reportedly approved by Chinese President Xi Jinping, designates it a "qualified divestiture." Under the deal, Oracle will provide "top to bottom security" by hosting American user data and reviewing the app's code. Crucially, TikTok's content recommendation algorithm will be copied and retrained to run solely on U.S. user data, with a majority of American investors and directors. The article emphasizes the complexity of this technical separation while maintaining global content access.</p>

The article highlights three key reasons to consider opening a HELOC this fall: their affordability compared to other borrowing products like personal loans and credit cards, the potential for further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve which would benefit variable-rate HELOCs, and the flexibility of making interest-only payments during the initial draw period.
