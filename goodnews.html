          <p>Following two days of talks in London, the U.S. and China reached an agreement on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus, according to representatives from both sides. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the agreement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries after accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. The framework includes resolving Chinese restrictions on rare-earth exports to the U.S. and a rollback of U.S. restrictions on advanced tech sales to China as Beijing approves rare earths exports. Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will seek President Trump's approval, while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao also participated in the discussions.

Zuckerberg admires Wang's leadership and technical expertise, believing he can improve Meta's AI efforts following the lukewarm reception of its Llama AI models.

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime during school breaks to combat the growing trend of children spending excessive time on digital devices. The Raising the Nation Play Commission warns that outdoor play in England has declined by 50% in a generation due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. The report calls for a national Play Strategy for England, including updating planning policies, protecting play in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community.
