        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following criticism over recent downward revisions to U.S. jobs numbers, experts are clarifying that such adjustments are a standard part of the process. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) issues preliminary reports to provide timely data and later revises them as more complete survey responses are collected. Former officials explain this is a feature, not a flaw, designed to balance speed with accuracy, especially as data collection has become more challenging. The recent revisions, while large, were attributed to late reporting from state and local governments and the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will open its market to Brazilian coffee, a move that comes just as the United States is set to implement a new tariff on the product. This development provides a critical alternative market for Brazil's coffee industry, which has been unsettled by the U.S. measure. The United States is the largest single consumer of Brazilian coffee, and the new tariff threatened to disrupt a significant portion of the country's exports. With much of its 2025 Arabica coffee harvest already completed, Brazilian exporters were actively seeking new buyers to mitigate the impact of the U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>Flaco Jiménez, the legendary Tex-Mex accordionist who passed away at 86, is being remembered not just for his musical genius but for his unique political voice. An appreciation article highlights his 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that used humor and a rollicking rhythm to tell a story of an undocumented immigrant's struggles. This approach, turning pathos into a defiant and joyful revolt, was characteristic of his work. Jiménez, who collaborated with icons from the Rolling Stones to Bob Dylan, used his music to support civil rights and political causes, leaving a legacy of resilience and pride.</p>

          <h2>Report: Permitting Requirements from Past Generations Now Slowing California's Modern Transit Projects</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 16:32:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from a San Diego nonprofit argues that extensive permitting requirements are a major cause of delays and budget increases for California's transit projects, including the high-speed rail. The analysis suggests that policies originally created decades ago to prevent disruptive highway construction are now hindering the development of beneficial public transit. These rules require transit agencies to secure approvals from multiple third-party jurisdictions, creating bottlenecks that can add years to timelines. The report points to systems in Canada, where transit agencies can self-permit if other bodies fail to act in time, as a potential model for reform.</p>
