        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates that the U.S.-China trade war significantly disrupted global supply chains, pushing them near a breaking point before the recent trade truce. The GEP Global Supply Chain Volatility Index showed a steep decline in manufacturing activity in North America and Asia due to tariffs, leading to aggressive stockpiling by U.S. companies. While the tariff pause provides some relief, manufacturers remain anxious about long-term risks associated with China. The Port of Virginia is positioning itself for potential growth from Southeast Asia and Europe as supply chains diversify. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. fell to 2.3% in April, the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, slightly below expectations, with shelter prices being the main driver of the increase. Economists suggest that the impact of President Trump's tariffs is yet to be fully felt, as importers may have absorbed some costs initially. Markets showed little reaction to the news, with stock futures remaining relatively flat.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a 90-day tariff truce, providing temporary relief to businesses but prolonging economic uncertainty. The U.S. will reduce its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports to 30%, while China will lower its tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts caution that a long-term trade deal remains challenging, and the reduced tariff rate could still lead to price increases for consumers.

          <p>Albania's ruling Socialist Party, led by Prime Minister Edi Rama, has secured a clear victory in recent elections, paving the way for Rama's fourth term in office. With nearly all votes counted, the Socialists have won 82 seats in the 140-seat Parliament, drawing support from voters who back the country's bid to join the European Union. The opposition Democratic Party-led coalition secured 52 seats. Rama's party has pledged to secure EU membership within five years, a goal conservatives argue Albania is not yet ready to meet.</p>

          <p>The Czech Republic's arms industry is experiencing a boom, potentially complementing or replacing the country's traditional automotive industry as the main economic driver. While car production decreased in early 2025, arms production has surged, driven by exports and modernization efforts, especially following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The country is increasing its production of ammunition, military vehicles, and radar equipment, creating new jobs for automotive employees. While some are skeptical that arms will replace the automotive sector entirely, the defense industry's growth is undeniable.</p>

Debt management plans involve professional negotiation with creditors, and debt settlement requires negotiating with creditors to pay less than owed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer prices in the U.S. rose 2.3% in April compared to a year ago, slightly cooling from the previous month, defying fears of an inflation surge following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. While egg prices fell, gasoline prices dropped significantly over the past year. Economists anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers replenish inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect, though a rollback of some levies may soften the impact.
