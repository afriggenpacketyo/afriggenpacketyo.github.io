          <h2>Debate Intensifies Over Potential Impacts of Trump Tax Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 15:36:39 EDT</div>

          <p>As President Trump's tax agenda moves forward, policy experts are closely watching key issues that could affect millions of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee has released a preliminary text of its portion of the bill, but significant changes are possible before the final vote. With Republican control of the White House and Congress, the package could pass without Democratic support through reconciliation, though this process faces challenges due to budget constraints and differing priorities among lawmakers. The article notes the narrow Republican majority in the House could make the process difficult, with some lawmakers wanting a more fiscally responsible package.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that he plans to give away nearly his entire fortune within the next 20 years through the Gates Foundation, aiming to address urgent global problems such as child mortality, disease, and poverty. This announcement coincides with Gates' criticism of Elon Musk for orchestrating harsh cuts to USAID under the Trump administration, which Gates predicts will increase childhood deaths in poor countries. Gates emphasized his determination to spend 99% of his current fortune on humanitarian causes worldwide. The Gates Foundation, established 25 years ago, has already donated over $100 billion and plans to double its giving by 2045 before dissolving.</p>
