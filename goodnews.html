          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic 36% surge, its best day since 1992, adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This dramatic increase was fueled by the company's report of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, indicating massive future revenue from cloud and AI contracts. The news, which far exceeded Wall Street expectations, left analysts astounded and prompted multiple upgrades, cementing Oracle's position as a key player in the AI infrastructure boom. The company's robust cloud revenue projections overshadowed an otherwise mixed quarterly report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and his father, King Charles, met for 54 minutes over a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first reunion in 19 months. The meeting is viewed as a significant step amid a period of strained relations within the royal family, occurring during the Duke's four-day visit to the UK for charity events. While this brief reunion may signal a potential thaw in their relationship, Prince Harry did not meet with his estranged brother, Prince William, during his trip. The King traveled to London from Balmoral specifically for the meeting and his ongoing cancer treatment.</p>

          <p>A disruptive weekend bus strike across London has been largely averted after the Unite union announced a successful pay negotiation. The majority of workers, employed by London United, accepted an above-inflation pay offer, canceling their planned walkout on approximately 60 routes. This resolution provides relief to London commuters who have recently faced significant travel chaos due to separate industrial action on the London Underground. Negotiations are still ongoing for a small number of routes operated by London Transit.</p>

          <p>In a new Netflix documentary, actor Charlie Sheen shared a pivotal moment from his past involving a family-led intervention for his substance abuse in the early 1990s. Sheen recounted being surprised by a gathering of family and friends, including Rob Lowe, who urged him to seek help. He remained hesitant until his father, Martin Sheen, handed him the phone for a call with Clint Eastwood. Sheen said Eastwood's powerful words of encouragement were what ultimately convinced him to agree to go to rehab.</p>

          <p>As average mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, this article outlines several strategies for potential homebuyers to secure a rate below 6%. Options include exploring adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates, and diligently shopping around with multiple lenders to find better-than-average offers. The article also suggests that strategically timing a mortgage application around anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts could provide opportunities for lower rates, though this requires being prepared to act quickly in a volatile market.

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated, this article compares the benefits of Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for savers. Because CDs have a fixed interest rate, savers can lock in today's higher rates for a set term, protecting their earnings from future cuts. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely decrease following the Fed's decision. The choice involves a trade-off between the guaranteed return of a CD and the flexibility and access of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study from the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China support 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report underscores the deep economic ties between the two nations, which have seen bilateral commerce grow nearly fivefold in two decades. However, it also highlights a significant risk: 80% of Brazil's sales to China consist of just three commodities—soybeans, iron ore, and oil—creating a heavy reliance on a few products and a single major trading partner.</p>

Heart disease and cancer remained the top two causes of death, and both saw a slight increase in total deaths from the previous year.

On Earth, these specific minerals are often formed as byproducts of microbial metabolism consuming organic matter.

          <p>Despite reaching the statistical peak of hurricane season on September 10, the Atlantic has been unusually quiet this year. Meteorologists attribute the lack of storm activity to two main factors: persistent Saharan dust moving across the Atlantic, which inhibits the formation of thunderstorms needed for cyclones, and the planet being in an "ENSO Neutral" climate pattern. However, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) still maintains its forecast for an above-average season overall, as conditions could change in the remaining months.</p>
