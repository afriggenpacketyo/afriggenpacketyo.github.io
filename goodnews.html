          <p>The Japanese government has approved the allocation of 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize household and business energy bills during the summer due to inflation. This measure is part of a larger relief package aimed at mitigating the economic impact of U.S. tariffs, particularly on the auto industry. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the government's commitment to supporting small and medium-sized companies affected by these tariffs. The subsidies are expected to reduce household energy bills, with critics suggesting the timing is intended to bolster government support ahead of upcoming elections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures.

The growth was primarily driven by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, with the biopharmaceutical and aircraft manufacturing industries showing notable improvement. However, some industries, like the automobile and apparel sectors, faced headwinds due to price competition and shifting demand patterns. (not investment advice)</p>
