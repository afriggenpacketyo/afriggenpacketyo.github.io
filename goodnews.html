          <p>Prominent Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has been appointed chairman of Eightco Holdings, a public company that plans to acquire Sam Altman's Worldcoin (WLD) as its primary treasury asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the strategy and will change its ticker to "ORBS." Ives stated his belief that Worldcoin's biometric identity verification system will become the standard for authentication in the age of AI. This move follows a trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury strategies, similar to how MicroStrategy has accumulated Bitcoin to potentially increase shareholder value.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This sports commentary reflects on the often dull and routine nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches, contrasting their consistent success in qualifiers with their frequent disappointment in major tournaments. The article notes that England has lost only four World Cup qualifiers in the last 30 years, leading to matches that lack jeopardy and excitement for fans. It highlights memorable exceptions, such as David Beckham's 2001 free-kick against Greece, but argues that most qualifiers involve breaking down defensive, lower-ranked teams. The piece concludes that these games are a formality before the true test of England's progress begins.</p>

          <p>Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to expectant mothers in the Baltimore area through its Birth Companions program. Now in its 27th year, the program trains nursing students to offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor and birth. The doulas act as advocates for patients, bridging communication with medical staff without replacing them. This initiative has become more accessible following a new Maryland law requiring all hospitals to accommodate certified doulas during childbirth, aiming to provide a more supportive and empowering experience for new mothers.</p>

          <p>A father and son involved in a widely circulated video from a Philadelphia Phillies game have shared their experience after a confrontation over a home run ball. Andrew Feltwell caught the ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, for his birthday, but a woman then aggressively approached them, claiming the ball was hers. Feltwell ultimately gave her the ball to de-escalate the situation, which he described as shocking and inappropriate. In a positive turn, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided Lincoln with gifts, including a signed bat from the player who hit the home run.</p>

          <p>Two winning tickets for the $1.787 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in lottery history, were sold in Missouri and Texas. The winners will split the prize, with each choosing between a $410.3 million lump sum or an $893.5 million annuity paid over 30 years, both before taxes. The Missouri winner will face state income taxes on their winnings, which could amount to millions of dollars. In contrast, the Texas winner will not owe state taxes on the prize, as Texas is one of the states that does not tax lottery winnings.</p>

          <h2>Expert Tips on Securing a Lower Mortgage Rate as 30-Year Fixed Average Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 13:27:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaches a one-year low, financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take steps to secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as a higher score directly translates to a lower interest rate. Increasing the down payment, ideally to 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable loan terms and help avoid private mortgage insurance. Finally, borrowers should consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which can offer a lower initial rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a series of late-game collapses and a bullpen ERA ranking in the bottom half of the league, the Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to change their bullpen hierarchy yet. Manager Dave Roberts and pitching coach Mark Prior have expressed continued belief in their high-profile but underperforming relievers, including closer Tanner Scott and setup man Blake Treinen. The team hopes these experienced pitchers can regain their form before the playoffs, drawing parallels to last season when the bullpen found its stride at the right time. However, Roberts acknowledges that his faith is not blind and has given opportunities to younger arms.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets due to growing global uncertainty. This represents a significant increase of over 38% since the beginning of the year. Despite the record prices, some analysts believe the rally could continue, with major financial institutions like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecasting further increases into 2026. The article suggests that factors like a weakening labor market, potential interest rate cuts, and the need for portfolio diversification still make gold a potentially viable investment.

In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company admitted the error, which also appeared on T-shirts, calling the items a unique keepsake.
