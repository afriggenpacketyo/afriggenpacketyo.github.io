The first breach, announced in March 2024, exposed the personal information of 73 million people, while a second in July 2024 involved call and text records. Eligible individuals, who are being notified by email, can file for up to $7,500 in documented losses traceable to the incidents. The deadline to submit a claim is November 18, 2025, with final court approval for the settlement expected in December.</p>

          <p>A superintendent in the California Area School District in Pennsylvania is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible for low-income students. Dr. Laura Jacob uses over 30 3D printers to create violins for just $50 each, a fraction of the typical rental cost. Inspired by a YouTube video of the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra playing plastic instruments, the initiative has produced over 200 violins in five years. The program provides the instruments for free, empowering students and fostering a love for music in a community where over 70% of students are low-income.</p>

          <p>As interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain attractive, financial experts advise savers on how much money to invest. The decision should be based on an individual's overall financial situation, including whether they have a sufficient emergency fund. Savers should also compare CD rates against other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and consider future interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve is expected to lower rates. A strategy known as a "CD ladder," which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, is also recommended to maintain liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of upcoming earnings reports, analysts are expressing caution regarding key cybersecurity stocks. Investment firm Evercore ISI issued a short-term negative call on CrowdStrike, citing subdued channel checks and a premium valuation that could lead to a post-earnings pullback. Meanwhile, investors are watching Palo Alto Networks closely to see if its recent acquisition of CyberArk was a strategic move or an attempt to mask a slowdown in its core business. These developments create uncertainty in the sector as the market awaits concrete performance data from the companies. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Kiel Institute, Europe as a whole has spent $165.7 billion on Ukraine between January 2022 and June 2025, compared to $130.6 billion from the U.S. While the U.S. is the largest single donor, the data contradicts claims that Europe is not contributing its fair share. The report also clarifies that both the U.S. and Europe have provided a mixture of grants and loans.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug Ozempic to cash-paying U.S. patients for $499 per month, less than half its list price of nearly $1,350. The move comes amid intense political pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the country. The discounted price will be available through various platforms, including GoodRx, making it accessible at over 70,000 pharmacies. This strategy aims to expand access for uninsured patients and combat the market of potentially unsafe compounded alternatives that gained popularity during previous shortages.</p>

          <p>In a significant step for advanced nuclear energy, Google and Kairos Power will deploy a new reactor on the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) grid by 2030. The Hermes 2 reactor will provide up to 50 megawatts of carbon-free power for Google's regional data centers. In this first-of-its-kind arrangement, Kairos and Google will bear the financial risk of construction, while TVA provides a revenue stream through a power purchase agreement. The project aims to prove the viability of smaller, more affordable nuclear technology and establish a standardized design for future deployments.</p>

          <p>Conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims aired about the 2020 presidential election. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of spreading conspiracies that its voting technology was manipulated. This settlement follows a much larger $787 million payment Dominion received from Fox News for similar claims. In a statement, Newsmax did not admit wrongdoing but criticized the court's rulings as an attack on free speech, resolving one of the last major lawsuits from that election cycle.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study conducted in rural Kenya has produced stunning results, showing that unconditional $1,000 cash transfers to low-income households reduced infant mortality by nearly 50%. The research, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found the intervention was on par with the effectiveness of tools like vaccines. The cash allowed families to access better healthcare, leading to a 45% increase in hospital deliveries, and improved nutrition. The findings suggest that direct cash aid can be a powerful and life-saving tool in global health initiatives.</p>
