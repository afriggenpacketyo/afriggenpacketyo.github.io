          <p>A man in southern England discovered that his father had been swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago, resolving a long-standing family joke about the father not resembling his parents. The discovery was made through a home DNA test, which revealed unfamiliar relatives and led to the unearthing of birth records from 1946. BBC News is aware of five cases of babies swapped by mistake in maternity wards from the late 1940s to the 1960s. Lawyers anticipate more cases to emerge due to the increased availability of affordable genetic testing.</p>

          <p>The UK is hosting the second round of trade talks between the US and China, a move considered a diplomatic win for the country. The first round took place in Geneva, surprising many given the ongoing trade war instigated by former President Trump. The UK's role as host is seen as advantageous, given its efforts to reset relations with China and its pursuit of a UK-US trade agreement. Hosting the talks also provides opportunities for sideline discussions and strengthens the UK's position in international trade negotiations.</p>
