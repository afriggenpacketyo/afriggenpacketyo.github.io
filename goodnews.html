          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults shares five parenting rules to help navigate the complexities of raising children. The rules emphasize trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, focusing on the individual child's interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural heritage rather than relying on influencers or clickbait. Ultimately, the article suggests that love and attention are the most important factors in raising children, and that parents should focus on being themselves and enjoying the journey. Optimism about the future of children is present in the advice. </p>

          <p>Job seekers are facing a challenging hiring environment, described as a 'Glass Wall,' where numerous job postings exist, but applications seem to yield no results. Blake Isaacs, a marketing professional laid off in January, coined the term after sending over 1,000 applications with little success. Experts recommend strategies to overcome this obstacle, including networking, tailoring applications, and leveraging LinkedIn to connect with recruiters and hiring managers. Experts suggest that persistence and a proactive approach can help job seekers break through the 'Glass Wall' and improve their chances of landing a job.</p>

          <p>Mirra Andreeva, a Russian tennis player, thanked a young fan for gifting her a "lucky charm" before her French Open third-round victory against Yulia Putintseva.

Andreeva expressed gratitude to the little girl and attributed her victory to the charm's positive influence. Andreeva had previously lost to Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals last year, and is considered to be one of the in-form players in Paris, claiming titles at Indian Wells and the Dubai Tennis Championships earlier this season, making the victory a positive step forward in her career.</p>

Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye, a procedure never before performed for a spinal tumor. The surgery, involving facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Kalpesh T. Vakharia, was successful, and Flores is now cancer-free after radiation treatment.

          <p>Michael Saylor's bitcoin treasury strategy is being adopted by various companies, including Trump Media and GameStop, but Wall Street remains skeptical. The Trump administration has established a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the Department of Labor has rolled back guidance discouraging bitcoin investments in retirement plans. Saylor argues that embracing bitcoin by state and media actors will strengthen its decentralized ideals. Despite the corporate world's resistance, Saylor believes the market's reaction to Trump Media and GameStop may stem from structural financing dynamics rather than skepticism toward bitcoin itself, and notes the importance of diversification and protocol.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has hired Sarah Kapnick, formerly NOAA's chief scientist, as its global head of climate advisory, a unique role she envisioned back in 2004. Kapnick's role involves advising clients on navigating climate change, understanding its impact on businesses, and developing strategic frameworks for planning. Her expertise combines climate science with economic and business insights, helping investors make informed decisions about risk management and emerging opportunities. As government data becomes less available, Kapnick helps clients assess alternative data sets and build in-house teams to analyze climate-related information. (not investment advice)</p>
