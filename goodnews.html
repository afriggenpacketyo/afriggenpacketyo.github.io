          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a prominent real estate developer, attorney, and decorated WWII veteran who was a key figure in shaping Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at 105. Known as "Mr. Downtown Culture," he was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Nicholas also founded Public Counsel in 1970, the largest pro bono law firm in the U.S., to provide legal aid to vulnerable populations. His contributions transformed L.A. into a global arts hub and left a lasting legacy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Brooklyn has blocked the Trump administration's plan to prematurely terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for around 521,000 Haitian immigrants. The ruling stated that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reviewing conditions in Haiti before ending the program. The judge found that the interests of the Haitian TPS holders in remaining in the U.S. outweigh potential harm to the government. This decision provides a temporary reprieve for the immigrants, whose protections were set to expire months ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>A new medical innovation is saving lives on the front lines in Ukraine, where surgeons are using specially designed magnetic extractors to remove shrapnel from complex battlefield wounds. With up to 80% of trauma now caused by shrapnel from drone warfare, these tools allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer in response to needs identified by front-line medics, the modern magnets are powerful and precise, reducing surgical time and risk. This field-developed technology has been distributed to thousands of medics and hospitals, changing the face of emergency wartime medicine.</p>

Cramer suggests Meta's impressive performance is tied to its powerful advertising business, which helped it rebound from an early-year decline. He dubbed the trio the "M-N-Ms," suggesting they are reliable investments within the megacap tech group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is planning the first major redesign of its banknotes in over 50 years and is asking the public for input on new themes. For the first time since 1970, the notes may move away from featuring historical figures, with potential new themes including nature, British innovation, or significant historical events. The Bank's chief cashier emphasized that banknotes serve as a representation of national identity and that they are keen to hear the public's ideas. The consultation aims to create a new series of notes that are modern and representative of the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted significant reforms to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in an effort to spur housing construction across the state. The new legislation, pushed through by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing developments in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change eliminates a major tool that opponents have used for decades to delay or block new housing projects through lengthy environmental reviews and lawsuits. While other hurdles remain, the reform marks a seismic shift in the state's approach to development politics.</p>
