          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain calm and not panic in response to Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to similar downgrades in 2011 and 2023. He argued that the downgrade prompted more fear than warranted by the short-term economic environment, and suggested that investors use the situation as an opportunity to invest more, rather than sell off their portfolios. Cramer also cautioned against being swayed by fear-mongering, noting that those spreading fear may have ulterior motives. He suggested gold and bitcoin as hedges against government borrowing, if investors are seeking to act on their downgrade-prompted fear (not investment advice).</p>
