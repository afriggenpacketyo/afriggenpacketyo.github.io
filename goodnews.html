          <p>Amazon is set to invest $10 billion in North Carolina to construct new data centers aimed at expanding its artificial intelligence infrastructure. This move is part of Amazon's broader strategy to allocate up to $100 billion this year on capital expenditures, primarily focused on AI-related projects, as the company competes with other tech giants like Microsoft and Google in the rapidly evolving AI sector. CEO Andy Jassy has emphasized the significant business opportunity presented by generative AI. The investment is expected to generate 500 jobs within the state of North Carolina, contributing to the local economy.</p>

          <p>Vietnam has officially ended its longstanding two-child policy in response to concerns about a declining birth rate and a shrinking working-age population. Vietnamese lawmakers passed amendments to the Population Law, allowing families to decide how many children they want to have. The previous policy, in place since 2009, aimed to prevent overpopulation but has been relaxed over time. The country's fertility rate has dropped to 1.91 per woman, which is below the replacement level, raising concerns about the future workforce and aging population.</p>

          <p>Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, a World War II pilot, has been accounted for 82 years after his death during a bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma. McCook was credited with saving the life of a fellow airman by bringing the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed the airman to parachute from the craft before it crashed. His remains were recovered and identified through dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis. A rosette has been placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing, and he will be buried in his hometown in August 2025.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) plan savings rate has recently reached a new record high, approaching a widely used rule of thumb. In the first quarter of 2025, the 401(k) savings rate, including employee and company contributions, rose to 14.3%, according to Fidelity's analysis. Employees deferred a milestone 9.5% into 401(k) plans, and companies contributed 4.8%. Financial experts recommend saving at least 15% of pre-tax income each year, including company deposits, to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement, although the ideal percentage depends on individual circumstances.

          <p>Keir Starmer indicates that a trade deal struck with the US last month could be implemented soon, with the White House signaling that the UK will be spared from the increased steel and aluminum tariffs. Donald Trump has decided to provide "different treatment" to the UK, although the deal has not yet been formally signed. The agreement aims to eliminate tariffs on steel and cars, but uncertainty remains as the UK continues negotiations with the US. The reduction in tariff rates has been welcomed by the UK steel industry, but calls for the government to finalize the trade deal to remove uncertainty persist.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 11:05:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a finding that challenges existing theories of planet formation. The planet, named TOI-6894b, has a radius slightly larger than Saturn but only half its mass, and it orbits its star in just over three days. This discovery is puzzling because it was previously thought that small stars could not provide the conditions needed to form such large planets. The planet is also unusually cold, which further intrigues scientists. The James Webb Space Telescope is scheduled to study the planet to uncover more about its mysteries.</p>
