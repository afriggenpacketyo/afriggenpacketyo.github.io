          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report reveals a strong fiscal first quarter, marked by a 69% sales increase driven by its data center division, which is benefiting from the demand for GPUs in AI software. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a $50 billion market, as restrictions on its H20 chip have already cost the company billions in sales. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's Blackwell business is thriving, and cloud providers remain crucial customers, accounting for half of the data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, anticipating a surge in demand as AI models require more computing power for reasoning, positioning its Blackwell chips to capitalize on this trend. Optimism score is based on the company's growth and adaptation to market challenges.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after weeks of raging, with all evacuations lifted on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires broke out around May 12, but air quality alerts remain in effect in the Arrowhead region due to smoke. The National Interagency Fire Center reports the fires now cover about 30,000 acres, with the Jenkins Creek Fire believed to be human-caused. Interactive maps provide regular updates on the spread of the Jenkins Creek, Camp House Road, Munger Shaw, and Horse River fires, while donations are being accepted to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>

          <p>Lincoln Center has announced a $335 million plan to overhaul Damrosch Park, aiming to improve the aging site and open it up to the surrounding neighborhood. The renovation will include repairing the leaky garage roof and building a new amphitheater to replace the costly temporary stage used for outdoor concerts. The project, with $218 million already raised, seeks to rectify past urban renewal approaches that walled off the park from the community. The redesign, led by Walter Hood and Weiss/Manfredi, includes tiered gardens, a lawn, and a pool, responding to community desires and improving accessibility to the arts complex.</p>

          <p>Stock markets experienced gains on Thursday after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs. The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 percent in early trading, with investors encouraged by the possibility of a slowdown in the trade war. Nvidia's strong earnings report also boosted the market, as its stock surged 5 percent. Analysts noted that the court ruling could reduce uncertainty in the long run, although challenges to the ruling may create short-term volatility.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged as trading opened on Thursday after a panel of federal judges blocked President Donald Trump from imposing some tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw increases, reflecting investor optimism. The ruling invalidated levies on dozens of countries, including a 10% tariff imposed on goods from nearly all countries. However, the Trump administration appealed the ruling, leaving the ultimate fate of the tariffs unclear, though sector-specific tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum remain unaffected.</p>

The podcast comes as MSNBC is being spun off from Comcast into a new company called Versant, requiring separation from NBC News. Despite the changes, Wallace believes MSNBC will continue to cater to a politically progressive audience, with the spinoff prompting the hiring of a new newsgathering team. Wallace was inspired to try something new by her husband, Michael S. Schmidt, and the podcast will allow her to connect with guests on advocacy issues beyond instant political analysis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With persistent inflation, saving money can be challenging, but high-yield savings accounts offer an opportunity to earn a return that outpaces inflation. The national average savings account interest rate is low, but top high-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher rates. To secure the best rate, consider choosing a high-yield savings account from an online bank, which typically has fewer overhead costs and offers more competitive rates. Comparing different accounts and considering factors like fees will help maximize savings and prepare for future expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
