          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies has called for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence, emphasizing its potential for inclusive growth while warning of widening digital disparities without fair governance. Their statement, agreed upon at a summit in Rio de Janeiro, stressed the need for technical specifications and protocols involving the public sector and UN agencies to ensure trust, interoperability, security, and reliability in AI. The group also urged equal access to AI technologies, data, and research capacity for all countries, particularly those in the Global South, to prevent standard-setting from becoming barriers to market entry.</p>

          <p>Parents in the UK who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy will soon be legally entitled to bereavement leave, marking a significant change in employment law. The government is set to amend the Employment Rights Bill to provide at least one week of time off for grieving, extending a right previously only available for losses after 24 weeks or the death of a child under 18. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated that this change ensures no one endures the heartbreak of pregnancy loss without adequate time to grieve. The Miscarriage Association welcomed the move as a crucial step acknowledging the profound impact of early loss on parents.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to early years teachers who commit to working in nurseries within disadvantaged areas of England. This initiative, part of a £1.5 billion "Best Start in Life" strategy, aims to boost standards and narrow the attainment gap among pre-school children. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized tackling inequalities early, noting that only one in ten nurseries currently employ a specialist early years teacher. The scheme, which begins next year, also includes proposals for increased Ofsted inspections for new providers, though critics argue recent tax changes have already negatively impacted nurseries.</p>

          <p>Lena Dunham, known for "Girls," discusses her new Netflix rom-com "Too Much," set in London, which is loosely autobiographical but does not feature her as the protagonist due to past body scrutiny. She reflects on society's "deeply fatphobic, misogynistic, racist and ageist" culture, and how it informs body dynamics, along with her evolving relationship with her body post-hysterectomy. Dunham also addresses past controversies, including defending a writer accused of sexual assault and a "distasteful joke" about abortion, expressing regret for not allowing herself more time and space to process events in her 20s. She emphasizes the importance of acknowledging one's own complexities and sensitivities. Her new show, starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, aims to explore the vulnerabilities inherent in new relationships, reflecting personal growth and understanding.</p>

          <p>Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and his wife Connie are channeling billions into their philanthropy, the Ballmer Group, focused on improving economic mobility for disadvantaged children and families. Initially skeptical, Steve was persuaded by Connie that philanthropy plays a crucial role in proving effective solutions and stepping in where government falls short. The Group adopts a "cradle-to-career" approach, investing in diverse causes from early childhood education to housing initiatives, giving away over half a billion dollars this year alone. They prioritize communities with personal ties, like Los Angeles and Washington state, measuring success through metrics such as reduced community violence and higher graduation rates.

          <p>Wyoming's Green River Drift, a 70-mile cattle drive, stands as the longest-running in the U.S., a tradition maintained by stubborn ranchers like Albert Sommers and Jeannie Lockwood for over 125 years. This demanding, multi-day trek, born from a harsh 1889 winter, involves moving thousands of cattle to high mountain pastures for summer grazing, enabling hay growth for winter. Despite challenges like predator losses, declining beef consumption, and dwindling ranch numbers, the participants are driven by a "labor of love" rather than profit. Conservation easements, like Sommers's, aim to preserve this iconic land and way of life for future generations, including young riders like Shad Swain.</p>

This area, where the Columbia River meets powerful Pacific waves, has historically wrecked thousands of ships. Certified surfmen must perform daring rescues in 20-foot waves and 50-knot winds, enduring rigorous training that includes preparing for boat "rollovers" where the vessel spins 360 degrees. Whitaker himself tested a dry suit and experienced the intense conditions, noting the surfmen's remarkable calm and enjoyment amidst the chaos, highlighting their dedication to saving lives.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the 7/7 London bombings, this article assesses whether the UK is safer, reflecting on the evolution of its counter-terrorism strategy. The attacks exposed intelligence failures, prompting MI5 and police to improve collaboration and prioritize threats, leading to successes like foiling the liquid bomb plot. New legislation, such as the offense of preparing for terrorism, allowed earlier interventions. However, the rise of self-radicalized individuals and the far-right, fueled by online extremism, presents new challenges. Initiatives like Prevent and Martyn's Law, requiring security plans for venues, aim to enhance public safety, yet the threat remains diverse and complex.</p>

He explains its core elements, including government-to-government cooperation, academic exchanges, and mechanisms for data sharing and IP protection, highlighting its symbolic value in building trust during fragile diplomatic ties. In the current geopolitical climate, the STA has become politically sensitive due to national security concerns, economic competitiveness in AI and semiconductors, and techno-nationalism. Simon notes a past instance where IP protection concerns nearly hindered a joint clean energy project, illustrating the ongoing challenges of balancing openness with security.</p>
