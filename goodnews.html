        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, choosing to monitor the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. This decision prioritizes financial stability over growth concerns, as authorities grapple with a significant acceleration in housing prices and rapidly expanding household debt. The central bank noted that the unique "jeonse" rental deposit system contributes to high household debt levels, which can weaken consumer spending power. This policy hold comes after a rate cut in May, but rising risks in the housing sector now take precedence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman. The change in leadership comes after the President cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX holds major NASA contracts. Duffy's appointment places another administration official in a dual-hatted role during a critical period for the space agency, which is focused on its lunar and Martian exploration programs. The move also occurred amid a public disagreement between Trump and Musk over a major spending bill.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia's blue-collar city workers have reached a tentative agreement on a new contract, ending an eight-day strike that had disrupted city services and left trash piling up on the streets. The strike involved 9,000 workers, including sanitation employees and 911 dispatchers, who were seeking higher wages. The proposed three-year contract includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands. First-term Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm during negotiations, insisting that any deal must be fiscally responsible for the city, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately.</p>

The article suggests the film's narrative of migration and acceptance feels particularly relevant amid aggressive ICE raids targeting immigrant communities. While not overtly political, the film's exploration of feeling like an 'alien' in one's own home may speak to many Latino children witnessing the current administration's policies. The film's production was also marked by reports that the protagonist's queer identity was removed, adding another layer to its complex context.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom hardware to cool the next generation of power-intensive Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. As the AI boom accelerates, the massive energy consumption of these chips requires advanced cooling solutions. AWS determined that commercially available options were insufficient for its scale, so it developed the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX) that can be integrated into its data centers. This allows AWS to offer customers access to Nvidia's most powerful new systems, such as the GB200 NVL72, for training and running large AI models.</p>
