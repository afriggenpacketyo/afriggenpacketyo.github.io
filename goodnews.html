          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit, driven by strong demand for AI-related chips. However, the company issued cautious guidance for the third quarter and narrowed its full-year 2025 sales growth forecast to 15%. Citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, CEO Christophe Fouquet stated that while the company is preparing for growth in 2026, it cannot be confirmed at this stage. The Dutch firm is a critical supplier, making the advanced lithography machines necessary for producing the world's most sophisticated semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided by its first-ever home run swing-off, with an unexpected hero emerging in the form of Dodgers third-base coach Dino Ebel. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Ebel took the mound to pitch to the National League's selected hitters in the high-pressure tiebreaker. His steady pitches enabled Kyle Schwarber to hit three consecutive home runs, securing a 4-3 victory in the swing-off and a 7-6 overall win for the NL. Players and managers praised the exciting new format and credited the 59-year-old coach for his crucial role.</p>

          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, are building strong camaraderie at Euro 2025 through off-pitch activities as they advance to the quarter-finals. Players have formed a WhatsApp group for substitutes, called 'the finishers', and created a unique 'clicking' celebration for when they score, aimed at promoting positivity and unity. Captain Leah Williamson highlighted the relaxed atmosphere and banter within the camp, noting that the team is focused and cohesive. This strong team bond is seen as a key factor in their momentum as they prepare to face Sweden.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which constitutes nearly half of the military personnel sent to the city. The troops were deployed in June to address protests related to the Trump administration's immigration policies. The decision to withdraw them comes after calls from local officials like Mayor Karen Bass and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who opposed the federalization of the troops as political theater. Newsom is continuing to call for the remaining soldiers to be sent home immediately.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company forecasting a massive increase in first-half profit and revenue. The company, known for its viral 'Labubu' monster dolls sold in blind boxes, expects profits to rise by at least 350% and revenue by 200%. Analysts suggest the negative stock reaction could reflect investor belief that the company's explosive growth may have peaked, prompting profit-taking. Despite the pullback, many investment banks maintain a bullish outlook on the brand's continued popularity, especially in overseas markets. (not investment advice)</p>
