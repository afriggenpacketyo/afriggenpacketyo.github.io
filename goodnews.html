          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns and signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. The technology has potential applications in surgery, encryption, and rescue operations, although questions remain about its practical benefits compared to existing night vision devices.</p>
