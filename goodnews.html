          <p>Britain's defence review outlines ambitious goals for transforming the armed forces and preparing for potential war, but hinges on increased funding. While the review welcomes the government's aim to spend 3% of GDP on defence by 2034, it suggests that faster progress may be necessary given current global turbulence. The report emphasizes the need for a revolution in military approaches to address rising threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. Even achieving the government's submarine target would require defence spending to reach at least 3% of GDP.</p>
