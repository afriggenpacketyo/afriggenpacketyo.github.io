          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria, a move intended to support the country's path toward peace and stability. The action follows a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former insurgent leader. While the order dismantles the broad sanctions architecture, it retains targeted restrictions on former leader Bashar Al Assad and his collaborators. Administration officials emphasized that the goal is to give Syria's new interim government an opportunity to rebuild, while encouraging steps like normalizing relations with neighbors, including Israel.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision that would have allowed the sale of public lands in 11 Western states has been removed from the Senate's major spending bill. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, the provision's sponsor, withdrew it after facing opposition from fellow Republicans and Democrats, as well as procedural hurdles. Lee stated he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The proposal, intended to create affordable housing, was criticized for potentially restricting public access to recreational areas and threatening the bill's passage in the House.</p>

          <p>With interest rates elevated, savers are weighing the benefits of different financial products. This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 deposit in a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account. Calculations show that for 3-month and 6-month terms, CDs currently offer a slightly higher return, while a money market account outperforms a 9-month CD. However, since money market rates are variable and expected to fall with anticipated Fed rate cuts, the fixed, guaranteed return of a CD may be more attractive for some savers.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced its largest-ever healthcare fraud takedown, involving nearly 200 federal cases with intended losses of $14.6 billion. A central case involves a Pakistani national who allegedly ran a $650 million scheme targeting an Arizona Medicaid program for Native Americans, billing for substance abuse services that were never provided. The nationwide enforcement action targeted a wide range of fraudulent activities, from a massive urinary catheter scheme to a billion-dollar wound care fraud.

          <p>For homeowners needing to borrow funds, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a particularly timely option this July.

Interest rates on HELOCs are variable and have decreased since last fall, positioning current borrowers to benefit from anticipated future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, the flexible structure of a HELOC, where interest is only paid on the amount used, offers a less burdensome alternative to lump-sum loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The introduction of electronic line-calling at Wimbledon, replacing human line judges for the first time, has drawn mixed reactions from players and fans. While many players acknowledge the system's accuracy, some, like American Frances Tiafoe, miss the tradition and fan drama of the challenge system. Other players have noted that the automated voice calls are sometimes too quiet to hear clearly over the crowd noise. The change marks a significant shift for the historic tournament, moving from a long-standing tradition to a more technologically precise, yet less theatrical, officiating system.</p>
