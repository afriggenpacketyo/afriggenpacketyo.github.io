          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is anticipated to conduct a substantial reshuffle of her shadow cabinet on Tuesday, bringing back former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly into a prominent front bench role. Sir James previously served in government as foreign and home secretary, and his return is a key part of the changes. The changes are anticipated to reflect the next stage of the party's policy renewal program and underline the unity of the party under its new leadership. This larger-than-expected shake-up signals a strategic move by Badenoch to re-energize her frontbench team.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian town of Ulefoss sits atop Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements, crucial for modern technologies and renewable energy. Mining company Rare Earths Norway (REN) plans an "invisible mine" to extract these elements by 2030, aiming to avoid surface disruption while securing a vital supply for the European Union. This project could significantly bolster Europe's supply chain, currently dominated by China, despite local concerns about environmental impact and potential geological instability. If successful, this initiative could be a game-changer for European independence in critical materials.</p>

          <p>Italy's women's football team has reached the Euro 2025 semi-finals for the first time in 28 years, surprising many as dark horses under coach Andrea Soncin. Led by captain Cristiana Girelli, who has scored three goals, the team has shown tactical flexibility and an ability to exploit opponents' weaknesses. Italian football experts suggest Italy could threaten England, particularly in wide areas, by leveraging their strong wing-backs and dribbling skills. While England remains the favorite, Italy's disciplined play and potential to capitalize on any carelessness could lead to an upset, making for a fascinating game.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times, announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year, aiming to "democratize" the paper and allow public ownership. This decision comes as the news industry continues to face significant financial headwinds, with many publications struggling to adapt to changing media landscapes. Soon-Shiong's 2018 purchase had returned the paper to local control after turbulent ownership, and this new initiative seeks to further solidify its independence and connection to the community. The move aims to allow the public to have ownership of the paper, fostering a more direct relationship with its readership.</p>

She argues that this expectation perpetuates a narrow and often negative perception of the Balkans, hindering the translation of diverse narratives. Schnabl advocates for publishers to embrace stories that explore universal themes without requiring a "self-exoticising twist" or didactic value about the region's history. She calls for a broader engagement with the rich variety of voices emerging from the Balkans, beyond stereotypical portrayals, to expand cultural understanding.</p>
