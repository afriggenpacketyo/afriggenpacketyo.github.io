          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential tariff escalation. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the agreement, the EU has reportedly committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments. The announcement, made alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, is presented as a significant step toward stabilizing the trade relationship between the two major economies.

          <p>England's women's national football team has secured the Euro 2025 championship, defeating Spain in a tense final that was decided by a penalty shootout. After falling behind to a Spanish goal in the first half, England equalized with a header from Alessia Russo in the 57th minute. The match remained deadlocked through the rest of regulation and extra time, leading to penalties. Substitute Chloe Kelly, who also scored the winning goal in the 2022 final, once again proved decisive by converting the winning spot-kick, delivering another major international trophy for the Lionesses.</p>

          <p>Undefeated UFC lightweight champion Ilia Topuria has publicly expressed his desire to transition to boxing for a fight against Mexican superstar Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez. Topuria stated that facing Canelo, whom he has long considered an idol, would be his preference over fighting Terence Crawford. He is appealing to UFC and influential figures like Turki Alalshikh to facilitate the crossover bout, similar to Conor McGregor's fight against Floyd Mayweather. While Canelo responded respectfully, he remained non-committal, stating his current focus is on his upcoming fight with Crawford, leaving Topuria's ambitious challenge unanswered for now.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the influential American musician, satirist, and Harvard-trained mathematician, has passed away at the age of 97. Known for his darkly humorous and politically charged songs that gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, Lehrer was a unique figure who balanced a successful academic career with his musical pursuits. His work, including enduring songs like "The Elements" and "The Masochism Tango," has inspired modern comedians and satirists like Weird Al Yankovic. Despite his fame, Lehrer spent most of his life in academia, teaching at prestigious institutions such as Harvard and MIT.</p>

England's bowlers toiled on a placid pitch but were ultimately frustrated, with a critical dropped catch of Jadeja by Joe Root proving costly. The draw means England's 2-1 series lead remains intact, setting up a decisive final Test at The Oval.</p>
