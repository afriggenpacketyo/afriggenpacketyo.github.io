          <h2>Deconstruction of Buildings as a Climate-Friendly Solution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement in the construction industry promotes deconstruction, or taking apart buildings piece by piece, as a method to reuse materials, reduce landfill waste, and minimize the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction creates a circular economy by harvesting lumber and other materials from old buildings instead of sourcing new ones. While deconstruction can be more costly and time-consuming, some local governments are incentivizing or requiring it to meet waste reduction goals. The future of climate-conscious construction involves planning for disassembly before a building is even built, thus ensuring materials can be reused. The practice can limit the climate impact of our built environment, which accounts for nearly 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so it is important that the practice continues to develop and be more widely adopted.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly reached an agreement to sign German attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of ¬£116 million. The deal includes a guaranteed ¬£100 million with ¬£16 million in potential add-ons based on Liverpool's future success. Wirtz, who debuted for Leverkusen at 17, has scored 57 goals in 197 games for the club and played a key role in their 2024 Bundesliga title win. He has also made 31 appearances for Germany since his debut in 2021, marking him as a valuable addition to Liverpool's roster. Manchester City and Bayern Munich had previously shown interest in Wirtz, but ultimately Liverpool secured the transfer.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank set the yuan's daily fixing against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months. This adjustment occurred as the U.S. dollar index fell to a three-year low following lower-than-expected producer price index data, which prompted expectations of further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness. While a recent agreement "in principle" between China and the US signaled a potential trade truce, some analysts remain cautious about the situation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists suggest that the decline in "white collar" job creation is primarily driven by structural economic issues, not artificial intelligence. While professional and business services have seen limited hiring, other industries like health care and construction have experienced job growth. Experts argue that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot fully replace human intervention for many key skills. Despite the current limited impact of AI, economists acknowledge that jobs are likely to transform in the future, with increasing demand for consulting roles focused on implementing generative AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The strait sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil pass through, but a full-scale disruption is considered improbable and potentially impossible. Experts suggest that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially since its oil infrastructure hasn't been directly targeted. China, Iran's largest oil customer, would likely pressure Iran to maintain oil flows, and disrupting the channel could harm Iran's own imports.</p>

          <p>David Attenborough's Ocean film highlights the destruction of marine life, primarily caused by the fishing industry. The film advocates for a shift in perspective, prioritizing protection of the seas rather than exploitation, and suggests concentrating residual fishing in local coastal communities. Research indicates that trawling and dredging release large amounts of carbon from the seabed, adding to the environmental costs of the fishing industry. Despite the government's announcement to ban trawling in some MPAs, more comprehensive measures are needed to achieve good environmental status for the seas, given the small size of the fishing industry.</p>

Although China holds the largest deposits, India possesses substantial reserves and a significant share of the world's beach and sand mineral deposits, presenting a considerable opportunity for diversification.</p>
