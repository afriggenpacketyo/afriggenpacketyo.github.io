          <p>Mykale Baker, an 18-year-old in Dacula, Georgia, went to Burger King after his graduation and helped his overwhelmed coworkers, despite not being on the clock. A customer, Maria Mendoza, was impressed by his work ethic and posted a video online, starting a crowdfunding campaign. The campaign raised over $200,000, which Baker plans to use for trade school to become a master auto mechanic and open his own shop. The Burger King Foundation also surprised Baker and Mendoza's daughter with $10,000 each, recognizing their achievements and integrity, highlighting the positive impact of hard work and community recognition. </p>

          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement by mid-June, despite remaining differences on key issues. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, stated that progress was made during talks with U.S. officials in Washington, but no final decisions have been reached. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently include a 24 percent tariff on Japanese goods. Japan has proposed joint efforts in areas such as supply chain resilience, shipbuilding cooperation, increased imports of U.S. farm products, and streamlined safety regulations for foreign-made cars.</p>

          <p>Japanese securities firms are donating shareholder perks, such as food and beverages, to nonprofit organizations that support children living in poverty. The Japan Securities Dealers Association initiated the program in 2020, facilitating the donation of around 2,300 items by March of this year. Participating brokerages, like IwaiCosmo Securities Co. and Monex Inc., have received positive feedback, noting that their donations have reached single-mother households and children's gatherings. NPO Bridge for Smile, a recipient of these donations, expressed gratitude for the support, especially given rising food prices.</p>
