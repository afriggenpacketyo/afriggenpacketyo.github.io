          <p>During a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a valuable partner, highlighting their commitment to invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel and safeguard American jobs. Trump stated that the two companies would establish a strong alliance, ensuring the continued operation of U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for at least a decade. He also announced plans to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the existing 25%, aiming to bolster the domestic steel industry and national security. Trump emphasized that this investment is the largest in Pennsylvania's history and will secure the jobs of U.S. Steel workers. </p>

          <p>An appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to resume mass firings of federal employees, maintaining a pause on Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)-led cuts. The court's 2-1 ruling supported a California judge's order questioning the legality of the administration's efforts to downsize the federal workforce. The ruling stated that the executive order exceeded the President's constitutional powers, despite the administration's claim that voters had given Trump a mandate to reshape the federal government. This decision means that the administration cannot proceed with its planned large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans for federal agencies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on foreign steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, celebrating an agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel. Trump insisted that US Steel would remain an American company after the partnership with Nippon, despite conflicting information on US Steel's website referring to the transaction as an acquisition. The tariff increase aims to further secure the steel industry in the United States, with Trump promising that every US steel worker would soon receive a $5,000 bonus. The announcement follows a federal appeals court decision allowing Trump's tariffs to remain in effect.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan and the U.S. are making progress in tariff negotiations, potentially reaching a deal as early as next month. Akazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington, with plans for further negotiations before the G7 summit in June. Japan continues to seek the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports. The discussions aim to reach an agreement that benefits both countries, with Japan proposing increased investment in the United States and cooperation in resurrecting the U.S. shipbuilding capacity.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities and supporters are expressing anger over the sport's 130-year history without a knighthood or damehood. The Rugby Football League spokesperson stated that their players have been "poorly treated" by the honors system. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons, has added his voice to the debate, stating that the lack of rugby league knighthoods "cannot be right" when compared to other sports. It has been suggested that class prejudice and snobbery may contribute to the lack of recognition for rugby league stars.</p>
