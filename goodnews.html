          <p>Despite business leaders laying off employees in anticipation of AI taking over their jobs, generative AI platforms are not yet at a point where they can fully replace human workers. Research indicates that AI chatbots have not had a significant impact on earnings or recorded hours in any occupation. Business owners would like to replace employees with AI, but the technology is not advanced enough, it's too expensive to build AI systems, and businesses are hesitant to give up data and intellectual property to tech companies. While AI is expected to advance, it is still years away from fully replacing human employees.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers is marching from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. The march is in line with the Quaker tradition of activism and seeks to show solidarity with migrants targeted by the administration. The protesters aim to deliver a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document advocating for religious freedom, to the US Capitol. Quakers believe the document's message of welcoming all remains relevant today amid restrictive immigration policies.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a trade deal with the Trump administration. The aerospace industry would receive a guarantee of zero tariffs, providing certainty to a ¬£40bn sector and supporting jobs in the UK.
