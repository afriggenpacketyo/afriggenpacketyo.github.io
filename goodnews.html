          <p>Florence Welch, the singer from Florence and the Machine, revealed that she had life-saving emergency surgery in August 2023 after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. Welch was unknowingly suffering from serious internal bleeding while performing on stage at a festival. She was diagnosed with a ruptured fallopian tube after suffering a miscarriage, requiring immediate surgery to remove the affected organ. Welch had previously cancelled concerts citing reasons she wasn't ready to discuss, and she is now preparing to release a new album in October, titled 'Everybody Scream'.</p>

While many of the museum's most iconic pieces cannot leave China, immersive technology will allow for their display abroad. The museum is actively promoting digital exhibitions, replicas, and high-quality photo exhibitions to be displayed in museums around the world, making its treasures accessible to a wider audience. This initiative aims to overcome logistical hurdles and share China's rich cultural heritage globally.</p>

          <p>An opinion article discusses the potential end of ideology in US-China relations under President Trump, suggesting a "reverse convergence" where the US may adopt similar approaches to political legitimacy and war as China. The author argues that this shift is not about the US losing soft power, but rather about a change in how the US approaches international relations. The piece challenges the long-held Western belief in convergence theory, which posits that societies become more alike as they industrialize, and highlights the complexities of social change and power dynamics between nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with congressional leaders ahead of the October 1 deadline to reach an agreement on a spending bill and avert a government shutdown. The meeting includes Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Democrats are pushing for the bill to include a permanent extension of tax credits for Americans enrolled in health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. A government shutdown would impact non-essential programs and halt the pay of hundreds of thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>In a quiet part of east England, the UK's first rice crop is thriving due to the record-breaking hot summer. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas is leading the trial, which aims to determine what foods Britain could grow in the future amidst climate change. Nine varieties of rice, including risotto, basmati, and sushi rice, are being tested in mini paddy fields. The project could help the UK tackle climate change by flooding peat soils, potentially reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and is of interest to the government.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley defended American Ryder Cup fans, calling them "passionate" despite reports of unacceptable shouts and personal insults directed at European players during the event. Bradley contrasted the atmosphere to what he heard were "violent" conditions in Rome two years prior, while European captain Luke Donald acknowledged some fans crossed the line with personal insults. The US team requires a sporting miracle to overcome Europe's lead heading into the final day. Donald also addressed Viktor Hovland's neck injury, potentially reducing the singles matches.</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison and his son David are making significant moves in the media landscape, potentially rivaling established dynasties like the Murdochs. Larry's close relationship with President Trump has facilitated deals involving TikTok and Paramount.

The Ellisons are also reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, which would create a media giant. Senator Elizabeth Warren has called for scrutiny of these deals, citing concerns about the concentration of power.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, received an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. They found that the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius, which thrives in sweaty shoes, is the culprit behind the odor. Their experiments showed that a short blast of ultraviolet C (UVC) light could kill the microbes and eliminate the smell. The researchers proposed a shoe rack equipped with a UVC light to sterilize shoes, offering a solution to a common household problem.</p>
