        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the significant gap in French cinema regarding the nation's history with the transatlantic slave trade. The author notes that their own understanding of this history was shaped primarily by American films like "Roots" and "12 Years a Slave." While acknowledging recent efforts by French filmmakers to tackle the subject, such as the films "Fanon" and "Zion," the piece argues these compelling narratives are still marginalized within the mainstream French film industry. It concludes that while French audiences are ready to confront this history, the cinematic establishment has been slow to respond.</p>

          <p>The Chinese yuan has shown significant gains against the US dollar, reaching its strongest level since last November, with analysts forecasting the trend to continue. This appreciation is attributed to a more resilient Chinese economic outlook than previously feared and growing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. Investment bank Goldman Sachs projects the yuan will continue to strengthen, potentially breaking the 7-per-dollar mark within six months and reaching 6.9 in a year, reflecting shifting global economic sentiments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Panelists at the East Tech West conference emphasized the need for nations, particularly emerging economies, to develop "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic autonomy and cultural relevance. This involves creating AI systems tailored to local languages and contexts, rather than relying on English-based models from major tech companies. The experts suggested that the use of open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services are key strategies to democratize AI development. This approach would allow countries to build their own AI ecosystems and ensure the technology's benefits are more inclusively distributed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, driven by an expansion in production and new orders, though export orders continued to decline. Economists attribute the divergence between the private and official surveys to differences in sample size and timing, with the Caixin survey focusing more on smaller, export-oriented firms that may be responding to recent tariff reductions.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law two significant housing bills designed to accelerate construction by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new legislation exempts most urban housing projects from the state's stringent environmental review process, a move aimed at tackling the state's severe housing shortage. Newsom forced the bills through the legislature by tying them to the state budget, sidestepping opposition from some labor and environmental groups to pass what he called the most consequential housing reform in the state's modern history.</p>

Canadian officials framed the decision as part of a broader negotiation, confirming that trade talks with the U.S. have now resumed.

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified a naturally occurring compound called betaine, produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine prevents inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the anti-aging benefits of exercise and suggest potential new strategies for developing therapies that simulate its positive effects on health and longevity.</p>
