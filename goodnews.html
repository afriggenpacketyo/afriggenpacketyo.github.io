          <p>Rio de Janeiro is deploying one of its largest-ever peacetime security operations for the upcoming BRICS summit, involving approximately 20,000 military personnel. The comprehensive measures are designed to protect leaders and officials from 28 countries and various international organizations. Security protocols include a no-fly zone enforced by armed fighter jets and the temporary closure of the city's domestic airport to commercial traffic, rerouting flights to ensure the safety and smooth operation of the high-profile international event.</p>

          <p>As the Fourth of July approaches, experts from Canine Companions offer advice for dog owners to manage their pets' anxiety from fireworks. They recommend not taking dogs to fireworks displays due to their sensitive hearing and instead creating a safe, secure space at home. To help dogs relax, owners should exercise them earlier in the day and provide mental stimulation, such as puzzle toys or frozen treats, to tire them out before the loud noises begin, ensuring a less stressful experience for their furry companions.</p>

          <p>A prominent Beijing-based think tank has proposed a major fiscal intervention to address China's mounting local government debt crisis. The plan involves issuing 30 trillion yuan (US$4.2 trillion) in special treasury bonds to swap out the hidden liabilities held by local authorities, which pose a significant risk to the nation's financial stability. Proponents argue this comprehensive package is necessary to cut off financial risks at their root, restore local fiscal capabilities, and re-energize the country's economic growth momentum.

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to travel through our solar system. The comet, spotted by a telescope in Chile, is currently 420 million miles from Earth and poses no threat as it moves at a blistering 37 miles per second. This visitor from another star system is an exciting opportunity for astronomers, who are now closely monitoring it to determine its size, shape, and composition. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October.</p>

          <p>This article proposes a method to make popular GLP-1 anti-obesity drugs more affordable for Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance. The plan involves eliminating the current system of rebates and coupons, instead having manufacturers charge health plans a straightforward direct-to-consumer price. Employers could then contribute to this cost, significantly reducing out-of-pocket expenses for employees and making these transformative but expensive medications more accessible, which could have a major positive impact on public health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton was visibly frustrated when his second-round Wimbledon match was suspended due to fading light just as he was serving for the victory. The 10th-seeded player was leading his opponent Rinky Hijikata two sets to none and was ahead 5-4 in the third set. The umpire's decision, which came after Shelton had just missed three match points, means he must return the following day to complete what could be just a single game, disrupting his rest and preparation schedule.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Jack Draper attributed his surprising second-round Wimbledon loss to veteran Marin Cilic to his own performance rather than external pressure. As the highest-seeded British player, Draper insisted he simply wasn't good enough on the day and expressed disappointment with his game on grass this season. He candidly assessed his performance, noting that weaknesses in his forehand were exposed and that he needs to continue working on multiple areas of his game to compete at the highest level he aspires to.</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the common view of the Declaration of Independence as a purely individualistic document. The author argues that the American founding was, in many ways, a conservative effort to restore inherited traditions and rights. Furthermore, it posits that the declaration's central claim that "all men are created equal" is not a self-evident truth in a vacuum, but rather a concept deeply rooted in the West's biblical inheritance, specifically the idea that humanity is created in the image of God.</p>

          <p>The recently passed House domestic policy bill contains a new, temporary tax break specifically for senior citizens. The provision adds a $6,000 standard deduction for individuals aged 65 and older ($12,000 for couples), which will be in effect from 2025 through 2028. This benefit is designed to phase out for higher-income earners and will primarily assist upper-middle-class seniors. It is important to note this is a temporary income tax deduction and does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States labor market showed continued strength in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' expectations. This steady growth, led by the government and healthcare sectors, helped lower the national unemployment rate to 4.1%. The resilient performance comes amid economic uncertainty due to trade and fiscal policies. The solid jobs report suggests the Federal Reserve is likely to maintain its current interest rate policy in the near term as it continues to monitor the economy's trajectory.
