        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has proposed a binding target for the EU to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. This goal is intended to provide certainty for investors and enhance Europe's energy security while keeping the bloc on track for its 2050 net-zero target. However, the proposal faces resistance from some member states who find it too ambitious. A controversial clause allowing the purchase of international carbon credits to offset emissions has also drawn sharp criticism from environmental groups, who argue it undermines domestic climate action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie secured a place in the third round of Wimbledon with a hard-fought victory over American 12th seed Frances Tiafoe. After dropping the first set, the former British number one rallied to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 in a thrilling match on Court One. This performance marks a significant win for Norrie, who has seen his world ranking drop from a career-high of eighth to 61st due to injury and inconsistent form. The victory provides a boost for British tennis, although compatriot Katie Boulter was unexpectedly knocked out in her second-round match.</p>

          <p>Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a patient century to lead his team to a score of 310-5 at the close of day one of the second Test against England at Edgbaston. Despite England captain Ben Stokes choosing to bowl first, the pitch proved favorable for batting. England's bowlers, particularly Chris Woakes, made early inroads, but a resilient 99-run partnership between Gill and Ravindra Jadeja stabilized the Indian innings. While India holds a slight advantage, England remains in the contest, mindful of their recent successful run chases and India's previous collapse from a strong position.</p>

          <p>British university student and qualifier Ollie Tarvet was eliminated from Wimbledon after a straight-sets loss to two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court. Despite the 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 defeat, the world number 733 put up an entertaining fight, creating 11 break point opportunities against the second seed. Tarvet's surprising run through qualifying and the first round captured the attention of fans and earned him significant prize money.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions' recent 52-12 victory over the Queensland Reds is providing clearer insights into the potential lineup for the upcoming Test series against Australia. Key performances, such as those by captain Maro Itoje and winger Tommy Freeman, are solidifying their positions, while others face increasing pressure. An injury to the versatile Elliot Daly has created uncertainty at the full-back position, though the team has depth to cover the loss. As the tour progresses, competition for spots on the Test team is intensifying, with each match serving as a crucial audition for the players.</p>

          <p>A new mission is being organized to find Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft following the discovery of a potential clue in a satellite image. Researchers from the Archaeological Legacy Institute believe the image may show a part of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane on Nikumaroro, a remote island in Kiribati. The expedition, organized by Purdue University where Earhart taught, will travel to the island in November to investigate the site. This development, 88 years after Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared, offers what some researchers call the best opportunity yet to solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is scaling up a program to combat the New World screwworm, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae can devastate livestock, wildlife, and even humans. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs fail to hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This biological control method, successfully used decades ago, is being revived to create a buffer against the pest's recent migration northward from Central America.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering depositing a significant amount, like $10,000, into a certificate of deposit (CD), it is crucial to ask several key questions first. With the current economic landscape of falling interest rates, savers should evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is more beneficial, as short-term accounts currently offer higher rates. It's also important to assess one's ability to keep the funds locked for the entire term to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, one should compare CDs to liquid alternatives like high-yield savings accounts, which offer comparable rates and greater flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

This renewed interest is also fueled by the performance of Ether-based ETFs and Robinhood's announcement of plans to offer tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe. Despite the recent gains, the price of Ether itself remains down significantly for the year, as the network faces an identity crisis and competition from other blockchains.

The solution is an Ethereum-compatible chain that allows Bitcoin holders to use their assets in DeFi applications, such as lending and borrowing, without relying on centralized custodians. The project's founders believe there is a massive, untapped market for Bitcoin-based DeFi, potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars. To promote the launch, Botanix has also released a retro-futuristic video game where users can explore applications on the new network. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists have successfully sequenced the entire genome of an ancient Egyptian, revealing new insights into the region's ancestral history. The DNA, extracted from a man who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago, is the oldest yet recovered from Egypt. The analysis showed that while 80% of his genetic material originated from North Africa, a significant 20% traced back to people from West Asia, including Mesopotamia. This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections and movement of people between ancient Egypt and societies in the Fertile Crescent.</p>
