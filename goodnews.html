          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Kseniia Petrova, a Russian scientist employed by Harvard University, in an immigration case stemming from her failure to declare scientific samples. Judge Reiss cited a lack of factual or legal basis for the immigration officer's actions and expressed concerns for Petrova's safety if deported to Russia. Petrova's case began with a customs violation after she carried frog embryo samples into the country without declaring them. The government has unsealed felony smuggling charges against her, but the judge concluded that the initial visa revocation was improper.</p>
