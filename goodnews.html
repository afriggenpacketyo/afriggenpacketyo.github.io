He remains bullish on the cryptocurrency despite its price volatility, which has mirrored stock market trends influenced by global economic uncertainty. Kiyosaki has previously predicted Bitcoin could reach nearly $250,000 by the end of 2025 and encourages investment, arguing that fear of making mistakes keeps people from significant financial gains.

          <p>Following the deadly Texas floods that devastated the region, a summer camp for individuals with disabilities has reopened thanks to a massive volunteer cleanup effort. Camp Camp, located 30 miles downstream from the tragic Camp Mystic incident, was heavily damaged by debris, but a community response mobilized hundreds of volunteers with supplies and machinery. The effort, initiated by a social media plea, allowed the camp to welcome back its more than 800 campers, providing a vital space for children and adults with special needs. This display of community support offers a moment of hope amid widespread tragedy.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Frederick, a 50-year-old woman, discovered that a lump she believed was a pulled muscle was actually a rare form of metastatic malignant melanoma that had spread to her lungs and brain. Despite the advanced stage IV diagnosis, she had experienced no typical symptoms like headaches or coughing. She underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy, which, despite severe side effects, has led to significant improvement. Her care team is optimistic about her long-term survival, and she now mentors other cancer patients.</p>

          <p>Over the past 25 years, China has dramatically expanded its influence in Africa through the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), a strategic dialogue mechanism. This partnership has resulted in a nearly 30-fold increase in trade and a 100-fold growth in Chinese investment on the continent. Alongside economic ties, security cooperation has also surged, with China becoming a leading arms supplier and training thousands of African military officers annually. This "leapfrog development" has positioned Beijing as a key partner in Africa, often edging out traditional powers like the U.S. and France.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is significantly reducing its Military Working Equid program, with plans to put 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in honor guards and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, providing a living connection to military heritage. The Army has assured that the animals will be treated with compassion and placed in new homes, while a number will be retained for key ceremonies. The move is expected to save approximately $2 million annually from the Army's budget.</p>

          <p>The United States has taken a significant step toward regulating digital currencies with President Trump signing the GENIUS Act into law. This historic legislation establishes new rules for stablecoins, a segment of the crypto market, and represents a major shift from the government's previous hands-off approach. The crypto industry has celebrated the move, which is seen as cementing the U.S.'s role in financial technology, though critics worry the new regulations are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying. Another bill, the CLARITY Act, which would further reshape crypto oversight, now heads to the Senate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao is making a comeback at age 46, set to fight 30-year-old WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. After a four-year absence from competitive fighting, Pacquiao states his passion for the sport remains strong, and a victory would make him the second-oldest champion in boxing history. Critics question his return after a long hiatus, but his trainer Freddie Roach confirms his power and combinations are still present.

          <p>Representatives from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the M23 militia have signed a provisional ceasefire agreement, committing to a permanent truce and peace deal by August 18. The agreement, signed in Qatar, is a significant step toward ending the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced over seven million people. The terms of the final deal are still being negotiated, with M23 seeking the release of fighters and the DRC demanding the withdrawal of rebels from seized territories.

The event, which runs through September, features tracks in various industries like e-commerce, smart agriculture, and tourism, with a kick-off held simultaneously in eight cities, including Hong Kong and Bangkok. This initiative leverages Guangxi's long-standing role as a hub for cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities Marie Curie and Hospice UK are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months from paying council tax. This campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Advocates argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a significant income shock and added costs, and removing the burden of council tax would provide priceless peace of mind. While some support is already available, the charities are pushing for a more compassionate and standardized approach across the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of effort, scientists have confirmed that the California red-legged frog, a threatened species, is breeding again in Southern California for the first time in 25 years. The breakthrough came from using a custom artificial intelligence model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from relocation sites, which successfully detected the frogs' mating calls. This technological assistance was crucial for the project, which involved moving frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula to their historic range. The success marks a significant milestone in the fight against extinction and showcases how AI can aid conservation biology.</p>
