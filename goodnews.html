          <p>Mount Shinmoe in southwestern Japan erupted on Sunday, prompting the Japan Meteorological Agency to maintain a volcanic alert level of 2, urging people to stay away from the crater. The 1,421-meter volcano, located on the island of Kyushu and straddling Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures, erupted around 4:37 p.m., spewing smoke as high as 500 meters. The last eruption of Mt. Shinmoe occurred in June 2018, and the agency continues to monitor the situation closely to assess potential risks to nearby communities.</p>

          <p>The UK government is organizing a chartered flight to evacuate British nationals from Israel amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, particularly after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. British citizens are advised to register their interest in the flight online but are instructed not to go to the airport unless specifically told to do so. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has advised against all travel to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories due to the heightened security situation.</p>

The images, captured on Thursday and Friday, depict truck and vehicle movement near the entrance of the underground military complex. Fordo, along with nuclear facilities at Natanz and Isfahan, was targeted in the U.S. air strikes on Saturday, which President Trump hailed as a "spectacular military success." The International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran's nuclear safety center have reported no radiation or contamination at the nuclear centers following the attacks.</p>

          <p>Aviation history was made as the first passenger-carrying electric airplane landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The Beta Technologies electric aircraft, piloted by CEO Kyle Clark, flew from East Hampton to JFK with four passengers on board, covering 70 nautical miles in just over half an hour. Clark emphasized the cost-effectiveness of electric air travel, stating the flight cost approximately $8 in fuel. The successful flight signals the growing viability of electric air travel for short city trips, offering quieter and more sustainable transportation options.</p>

          <p>The article uses baseball, particularly Clayton Kershaw's near-perfect game in 2014, as a metaphor for dealing with failure and finding grace in imperfection. Despite Kershaw's dominant performance, an error prevented it from being a perfect game, highlighting the importance of accepting mistakes as part of life. The author contrasts this with Lou Gehrig's famous speech, where he proclaimed himself "the luckiest man on the face of the Earth" despite being diagnosed with ALS, emphasizing the power of humility and courage in the face of adversity. The article suggests that embracing imperfections with a positive attitude defines the ultimate success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article examines how Latinos' voting patterns shift when their community is perceived to be under threat, referencing the recent immigration raids in Los Angeles and Trump's deployment of military forces. While Latinos often prioritize economic issues, they tend to coalesce as an ethnic voting bloc when they sense a serious threat to their community, as seen in the past with Proposition 187 in 1994. The article notes that Trump's recent actions, including the treatment of Senator Alex Padilla, may be undermining his support among Latino voters. The author concludes that both Democrats and Republicans need to understand the full dimensions of Latino political identity.</p>

          <p>The article discusses self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain abortion pills without a prescription and take them without direct doctor supervision, and its increasing acceptance within the medical community. Studies have found that self-managed abortions are safe and effective, challenging the need for mandatory ultrasounds or in-person follow-up appointments. The COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade have accelerated the shift towards telehealth and self-managed options. However, political opposition and legal challenges remain, with some states seeking to restrict access to abortion pills and telehealth services.</p>
