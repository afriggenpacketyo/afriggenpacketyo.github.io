          <p>A recent survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center indicates a strong sense of nationalism among the Chinese public. The majority of respondents believe China should play an active role in global affairs and see their country's international standing as strong and likely to improve. However, opinions are divided on whether China or the United States is the dominant world power, suggesting a continued wariness of U.S. influence. This sentiment aligns with President Xi Jinping's muscular foreign policy, contrasting with a growing isolationist trend in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan contends that the traditional investment model centered on public markets is fundamentally flawed. He argues that the stock market has become dominated by passive indexing and a few mega-cap tech stocks, limiting diversification and true exposure to the broader economy. Rowan suggests that private markets, particularly private credit, offer more robust opportunities and that the old notion of public markets being inherently safer is outdated. As institutional and retail investors seek better returns, he foresees a major, permanent shift in capital allocation toward alternative investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital is increasing its brand visibility through unconventional marketing, notably by sponsoring professional tennis players. This strategy aims to familiarize high-net-worth individuals with the firm as the private markets industry seeks to attract a broader investor base beyond traditional institutions. Historically secretive, alternative asset managers are now embracing public-facing branding to capture a growing retail market. Blue Owl's campaign, which includes placing its logo on players' apparel, reflects a larger trend of private equity and credit firms moving out of the shadows to compete for mainstream capital.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in California is illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer stated the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling specifically bars troops from making arrests, conducting searches, or engaging in crowd control within the state. Judge Breyer warned that allowing such deployments would effectively create a "national police force with the President as its chief," setting a dangerous precedent for executive power.</p>

          <p>The creators of the American version of 'The Office' are launching a new spin-off series titled 'The Paper.'

Starring Domhnall Gleeson as the editor and featuring Oscar Nuñez reprising his role as accountant Oscar Martinez, the series aims to capture the beloved mockumentary style while exploring the challenges of local journalism. While not a direct reboot, the show will contain the original's DNA and Easter eggs for long-time fans.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026.

First elected in 1992, Nadler has had a significant career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a manager during President Trump's first impeachment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As savers contend with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have become an attractive option, with many accounts offering rates that outpace the current inflation rate. While national average yields for CDs remain modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, particularly for short-term CDs with terms of six months to one year. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, means savers can currently secure better returns on shorter-term commitments. Experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining a long-term savings plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new tax deductions introduced for 2025. The 0% capital gains bracket applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 for single filers or $96,700 for married couples filing jointly. With an increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks, more investors may fall into this bracket, allowing them to sell profitable assets without incurring taxes. This creates strategic possibilities for "tax-gain harvesting" or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

While some experts acknowledge that pure, additive-free tequila may be better tolerated due to fewer congeners, they caution that no alcohol is a health drink or truly hangover-proof.
