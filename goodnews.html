          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, benefiting The Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, maintains its hefty price tag, with individual tickets costing $75,000 and tables starting at $350,000, and attendance is by invitation only. This year's theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," marks the first Met exhibit dedicated exclusively to Black designers and menswear in over two decades. The event has already raised a record $31 million for the Costume Institute, and the host committee includes figures like Simone Biles, Spike Lee, and Janelle Mon√°e. A counter-event, The Debt Gala, will be held in Brooklyn to raise funds for medical debt relief in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a drop as investors reacted to Warren Buffett's announcement of stepping down as CEO, with Greg Abel slated to take over on January 1, 2026, though Buffett will remain chairman. The transition marks the end of Buffett's 60-year leadership of the conglomerate, which has grown from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion juggernaut. Despite the share decline, analysts view the transparent transition positively, noting Buffett's continued role as chairman will allow him to mentor Abel and provide guidance on major capital allocation decisions. Gabelli Funds portfolio manager Macrae Sykes believes shareholders should have confidence that Buffett isn't going anywhere.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is encouraging global business leaders to invest in the United States, despite concerns about President Trump's trade policies, arguing that the administration's economic plans extend beyond trade and will yield long-term benefits. Speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Bessent highlighted plans to cut taxes and regulations to spur job creation and output. He defended tariffs as a means to encourage direct investment in the U.S., promising a favorable tax and regulatory environment. Bessent's comments aim to reassure investors amid growing wariness of Trump's policies, which have led to market volatility and downgraded economic outlooks from organizations like the International Monetary Fund.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, ending its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation, and shares of the footwear giant soared more than 25% following the announcement. The transaction occurs during a challenging period for the retail and footwear industries, which are affected by discretionary spending and President Trump's trade war. Skechers had previously signed onto a letter requesting an exemption from Trump's tariffs and withdrew its full-year 2025 guidance due to macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies.</p>

          <p>Skechers, the footwear brand based in Manhattan Beach, is set to go private in a $9.4 billion deal with New York investment firm 3G Capital. The acquisition, expected to close in the third quarter, reflects a price of $63 per share. This announcement follows Skechers' decision to withhold full-year guidance in April, citing macroeconomic uncertainty related to global trade policies. President Trump's tariffs, particularly the 145% tax on goods imported from China, where Skechers manufactures a significant portion of its shoes, have impacted trade.</p>

          <p>An article reviews Amanda Hess's book, 'Second Life: Having a Child in the Digital Age,' which critiques the trend of optimizing parenthood through online resources and technology. Hess argues that the illusion of control is sold through apps, gadgets, and experts, promising insights into sleeping habits and developing psyches. The review highlights the commodification of parental helplessness and the pressure to resolve the 'problem' of parenting with techniques that stamp out childishness. Hess's work recognizes the anxieties of modern parents while cautioning against the notion that more information equates to better parenting, emphasizing that babies don't conform to optimization.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms like Meta and TikTok are shifting away from traditional fact-checking and adopting community-based moderation systems, such as Community Notes, to combat misinformation. Meta's decision to end its fact-checking program is framed as a return to free expression, while TikTok is testing its own version of Community Notes called Footnotes. These systems rely on users to correct each other's posts, with algorithms prioritizing notes that are rated as helpful by a diverse group of people. While these tools may foster a culture of responsibility and offer a cost-effective alternative to professional fact-checkers, they may struggle to counter sophisticated disinformation campaigns and penalize repeat offenders.</p>

          <p>Central Park's northern end, particularly the area around the Meer, has undergone a significant transformation to fix years of neglect.

The project encased the meer in a concrete retaining wall and much of the landscape was paved over and built up, including with an ice rink/pool.</p>

The author argues that the Murdoch press no longer has the power to sway voters and may even be damaging those who align with its views. The decline in News Corporation's influence is attributed to the fragmentation of media and the rise of distrust in mainstream media. The author calls for a shift away from reacting to News Corporation's excesses and a focus on independent agendas and engaging with the world as it is.</p>
