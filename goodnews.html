          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, resulting in the release of the insects. Authorities are urging people to avoid the area to prevent swarming and stings, while bee experts are working to contain the situation. The plan is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee in the next day or two, with the goal of saving as many bees as possible. Honeybees play a critical role in pollination and food production, making their preservation vital.</p>

Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Trump called the Japanese company a "great partner" and announced he would raise tariffs on steel imports to 50%. Trump emphasized that this investment would ensure U.S. Steel workers keep their jobs and facilities remain open, despite previously opposing the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel. The deal is still pending final approval, but Trump has indicated that it will ensure U.S. Steel remains under American control.</p>

The government is set to unveil its strategic defence review, outlining priorities for military and security spending in the coming years.

Macron emphasized France's commitment to its own interests while cooperating with both the U.S. and China, and he warned that the division between the two superpowers is the main risk confronting the world.</p>

          <p>Astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore recounted the tension of their troubled Boeing Starliner test flight, where failing thrusters left them unsure if they could dock with the International Space Station (ISS) or return to Earth. What was meant to be an eight-day test flight turned into a nearly 10-month stay in space. The astronauts had to rely on Mission Control to restart the craft's thrusters and dock safely at the ISS, before eventually returning to Earth on a SpaceX capsule. The pair also found themselves in the middle of a political row, after US President Donald Trump blamed his predecessor Joe Biden for abandoning them in space.</p>
