          <p>GE Vernova's CEO, Scott Strazik, revealed he has been in multiple discussions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman regarding the immense power generation and electrical equipment needed to support the growth of artificial intelligence. The energy company has seen a surge in orders from major tech "hyperscalers," with electrical equipment orders from this sector expected to nearly double this year compared to last. Strazik noted that GE Vernova is a key supplier to major AI players and is largely sold out of its power generation equipment through 2028. This highlights the critical link between energy infrastructure and the expanding AI industry.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "Finding My Way," Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai shares her personal journey beyond her public role as an activist. She opens up about her struggles with mental health, including panic attacks and flashbacks from the Taliban attack she survived, which eventually led her to seek therapy. Yousafzai also discusses her initial fears about marriage, rooted in seeing forced child marriages, and how meeting her husband, Asser Malik, changed her perspective. She hopes the book reintroduces her to the world, showing her growth while navigating friendships, university life at Oxford, and her continued advocacy work.</p>

          <p>Sean Dyche, the newly appointed manager of Nottingham Forest, has stated that winning games is more important than adhering to a specific fashionable style of play. Taking over a team currently in the Premier League's relegation zone, Dyche emphasized the need to play "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation. He referenced the team's successful, albeit different, style last season as proof that fans are open-minded, as long as it produces results. Dyche's immediate goal is to restore the basics and a winning mentality to the squad, which has been winless since the season's opening day.</p>

          <p>The NFL has officially approved the sale of a 10% stake in the New York Giants to philanthropist Julia Koch, a deal that values the franchise at a record $10.3 billion. This transaction marks the highest valuation ever placed on an NFL team during a sale process. The league's owners also approved two other minority stake sales for the New England Patriots and the San Francisco 49ers, valued at $9 billion and $8.6 billion respectively.

          <p>The Richmond-Upon-Thames Council has cancelled a £150 fine given to a woman for pouring a small amount of leftover coffee down a street drain. The woman, Burcu Yesilyurt, explained she did it to avoid spilling the coffee on the bus she was about to board and was shocked when three enforcement officers issued the penalty. After her story gained media attention, the council reversed its decision, stating the appeal would likely have succeeded as it was a minor contravention. Yesilyurt described the initial encounter as intimidating and called for clearer public information regarding such rules.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa, the thirteenth named storm of the Atlantic season, has formed over the Caribbean and is expected to bring heavy rainfall to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica. The National Hurricane Center warns of potential flash flooding and landslides, with rainfall totals of 5 to 10 inches possible in some areas through the weekend. While the storm is forecast to strengthen and could become a hurricane by Friday, its long-term track remains uncertain. Current projections suggest it is unlikely to have a major impact on the mainland United States, though its slow movement complicates precise forecasting.</p>

          <p>Australia secured a six-wicket victory over England in the Women's Cricket World Cup, overcoming an early top-order collapse. After England set a total of 244-9, led by Tammy Beaumont's 78, Australia stumbled to 68-4 in their chase. However, a commanding, unbeaten partnership of 180 between Annabel Sutherland (98 not out) and Ash Gardner (104 not out) guided the defending champions to a comfortable win. Sutherland also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets earlier in the match. The result serves as another powerful demonstration of Australia's formidable depth and batting prowess in the tournament.</p>

Panahi, who has been banned from filmmaking and imprisoned for his work, insists he makes social, not political, films that avoid judgment and allow the audience to decide. In a recent interview, he expressed concern about the "cycle of violence" continuing in Iran even after a potential regime change.</p>

          <p>Claire-Louise Bennett's third book, "Big Kiss, Bye-Bye," delves into the complexities of modern romance, offering a subtle counterargument to the growing sentiment of "heteropessimism." The novel follows an unnamed writer navigating the aftermath of a breakup, using Bennett's signature inventive and meandering prose to explore her inner world. The article suggests the book questions whether abstract, social-media-fueled debates about gender politics are productive. Instead, the novel seems to argue for the profound, specific reality of individual relationships, which exist both within and apart from broader societal trends, emphasizing the importance of lived, personal experience.</p>

Although she had limited playing time during the final tournament, she emphasized the importance of her role supporting the team from the sidelines.

          <p>Amid rising debt and economic pressures, this article clarifies a common misconception about Chapter 13 bankruptcy, explaining that it does not require filers to surrender all of their income. Instead, the process involves creating a three-to-five-year repayment plan funded by the filer's "disposable income." This is the amount left over after accounting for reasonable and necessary living expenses such as housing, food, and transportation. The goal is to create a sustainable payment structure, allowing individuals to maintain a basic standard of living while systematically addressing their debts, making it a viable option for those with regular income.</p>
