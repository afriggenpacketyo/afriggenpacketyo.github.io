          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate it will remain over open waters, possibly strengthening into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend. Its current track suggests it will stay north of the Caribbean, though it could reach Bermuda next week. The storm's path remains uncertain, but it marks an increase in activity after a quieter-than-expected season, despite initial predictions for a busier year.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies announced it has developed a 'world's most powerful' supernode computing cluster using local chipmaking processes, aiming to deliver world-class computing power without Nvidia's advanced chips. This breakthrough could significantly boost China's self-reliance in AI computing, reducing its dependence on US technology amidst ongoing tech tensions. Huawei also plans to launch upgraded Ascend AI chips in the coming years, signaling a determined effort to overcome US export restrictions. Nvidia's CEO expressed disappointment but acknowledged China's larger geopolitical agendas.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic defense pact, agreeing to consider an attack on one as 'an aggression against both.' This enhanced agreement deepens their decades-long security partnership, coming amidst Gulf Arab states' growing concerns about US reliability and following Israel's attack on Qatar. The pact aims to strengthen joint deterrence and comes after Saudi Arabia reportedly helped de-escalate tensions during a recent conflict between Pakistan and India. Both nations maintain close economic and cultural ties.</p>

          <p>Asian markets showed mixed performance after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate as anticipated, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell calling it a 'risk management cut.' Japan's Nikkei 225 surged to a fresh record, driven by real estate and technology sectors, while South Korea's Kospi also rose. Hong Kong and mainland Chinese indices slipped, and Australian gas producer Santos saw shares fall after an acquisition bid was aborted. The Bank of Japan is expected to keep its policy rates steady, with a potential hike later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Central Bank Expected to Exercise Moderate Easing After Fed Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts anticipate China's central bank will implement only moderate easing measures. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) adjusted the yuan's midpoint rate, and the offshore yuan initially strengthened. Experts predict a smaller rate cut pace from the PBOC compared to the Fed, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap and alleviate capital outflow pressures on the yuan. This approach aims to provide support for the yuan's stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At New York Fashion Week's spring/summer 2026 season, music played a crucial role in conveying designers' visions and shaping audience perception of collections. Designers collaborated with composers and DJs to create immersive soundscapes, ranging from a repeating poem by Nezahualcóyotl for Campillo to a 'New York, '70s, '80s, Nuyorican vibe' for Eckhaus Latta. Soundtracks evoked nostalgia, disorientation, or subtle tension, with some artists using music to explore deeper concepts like the Jungian shadow self or to comment on societal issues. The careful curation of music served as a vital, often subconscious, informational layer to the fashion presentations.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3% by weight. When chimps eat up to 10 pounds of this fruit daily, it equates to approximately 14 grams of ethanol, or two alcoholic beverages for a human. Researchers clarify that chimps don't get drunk but are exposed to a steady low dose, supporting the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis. This research provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits routinely eaten by wild chimps, suggesting a possible ancestral link to humans' attraction to alcohol.</p>
