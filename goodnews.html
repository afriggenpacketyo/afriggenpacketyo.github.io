          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 06:24:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but significantly better than the 0.1% growth that had been forecast. Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the services and construction sectors were key drivers of this unexpected resilience. However, analysts express caution, pointing to a sharp fall in business investment and a dip in household spending as potential drags on future growth. This stronger-than-expected performance may make the Bank of England more hesitant to cut interest rates as it continues to battle inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amanda Blanc, the chief executive of insurer Aviva, has strongly reiterated the company's commitment to its net-zero climate goals, despite increasing political resistance in both the U.S. and the U.K. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the insurance business, citing the rising frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods that impact property insurability. Her comments stand in contrast to a recent trend of major U.S. and U.K. banks withdrawing from climate alliances following political shifts. Aviva's stance was highlighted as the company reported a 22% jump in operating profits, boosting its share price to its highest level since 2008.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Grotesque, horn-like growths appearing on cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been identified by scientists as a result of the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless infection. While viral photos have led to nicknames like "zombie rabbits," experts from Colorado Parks and Wildlife state there is no reason for public panic, as the virus cannot spread to humans or other animal species. The growths, which are wart-like tumors, typically do not harm the rabbits unless they obstruct their vision or ability to eat, and their immune systems often fight off the virus over time. This same virus is believed to have inspired the myth of the jackalope.</p>

          <p>Following a devastating fire in January that destroyed the Altadena home and studio of the late, influential artist-activist John Outterbridge, his daughter Tami is leading a unique salvage project. Dubbed "Diggin' Bridge," the initiative invites artists who were friends and colleagues of her father to excavate the ruins for remnants of his work and archive. Outterbridge was a central figure in Southern California's Black Arts Movement, known for his assemblage pieces created from found objects. In that same spirit, the project aims not just to recover what was lost but to create something new, with participating artists making new works from the salvaged materials, turning a tragedy into a community-driven artistic reclamation.</p>

          <p>A new 12-part documentary series, "Rebel Architects: From Venice to the World Stage," revisits a group of seven Los Angeles architects, including Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne, who revolutionized the field in the 1980s. The series is centered around an iconic 1980 photograph of the group on Venice Beach, which captured their rebellious and creative spirit. Four of the surviving architects, now in their 70s and 80s, reunite for the documentary to discuss their early careers, the scrappy and collaborative Venice art scene of that era, and the evolution of their work and the city since. The series explores their legacy, rivalries, and the bittersweet loss of that era's creative freedom.</p>

          <p>More than 160 workers at Blizzard Entertainment's Irvine campus, who are responsible for producing cinematics, trailers, and other narrative content, have successfully voted to unionize. They will join the Communications Workers of America, becoming the latest group to organize within the rapidly expanding labor movement in the video game industry. Workers cited job insecurity from frequent layoffs and a lack of remote work options as key motivations for unionizing. The process was facilitated by a labor neutrality agreement from parent company Microsoft, which has allowed nearly 3,000 workers at its gaming studios to unionize without going through a formal NLRB election process.</p>

          <p>AMC Networks is strategically casting well-known American actresses like Alicia Silverstone and Brooke Shields to lead original series on its Acorn TV streaming service, which is traditionally known for British and international dramas. The move is designed to accelerate subscriber growth for the niche platform by attracting a wider North American audience. While Acorn has been profitable by serving a dedicated fanbase of "armchair travelers," the company believes a stronger focus on the mystery genre, fronted by familiar stars, can expand its market. Silverstone stars in the new series "Irish Blood," and Shields will lead "You're Killing Me," set to premiere in 2026.</p>

          <p>The FBI has returned a significant historical artifact to Mexico: a 500-year-old manuscript page signed by the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés. The document, penned in 1527, details payments for supplies for his expeditions and is one of 15 pages believed to have been stolen from Mexico's national archives between 1985 and 1993. The page was discovered in the United States after the Mexican government requested assistance from the FBI's art crime team in 2024. Because the document had changed hands multiple times since its theft, no one will be prosecuted, but the FBI stated its commitment to locating and returning the remaining missing pages.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has confirmed that the club has agreed to a deal worth approximately £26 million to sign 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma. The center-half, an Italy U-19 international, was a key target for Slot and is set to move to Anfield after a breakthrough season in Serie A where he made 17 appearances. While confirming the agreement, Slot declined to comment on speculation about a potential move for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi. If completed, the signing of Leoni would be part of a significant summer spending spree for the defending Premier League champions.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has ended its controversial "Visit Rwanda" tourism sponsorship, a deal that drew heavy criticism from fans and human rights activists due to Rwanda's alleged role in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Instead of completely severing ties, Bayern announced a new "strategic evolution" of the partnership, which will now focus on football development through its youth academy in Kigali. Sports sponsorship experts suggest the move was forced by external pressure and negative PR rather than a moral stance. The club's decision highlights the ongoing tension between the commercial ambitions of major sports teams and the ethical implications of partnering with nation-states.</p>

          <h2>New Research Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps is an Optimal Target for Health Benefits</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While 10,000 steps per day is a widely cited fitness goal, new research suggests a more achievable target of around 7,000 steps may be optimal for significant health benefits. A comprehensive review published in The Lancet Public Health found that taking 7,000 steps daily was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of premature death compared to taking just 2,000 steps. The study also linked this target to a reduced risk of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and dementia. Researchers noted that while exceeding 7,000 steps isn't harmful, the additional health benefits show diminishing returns, making 7,000 a realistic and effective goal for many people.</p>
