          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:07:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company saw a 1% decline in global unit case volume, indicating weaker consumer demand in markets like North America and Latin America. Despite these mixed results, the company narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the upper end of its previous range. The report also confirmed plans to launch a cane sugar version of its classic soda in the U.S. this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Taiwan are evaluating a potential collaboration on a spaceport for suborbital flights, which could drastically reduce travel times. According to the American Institute in Taiwan, this partnership could shorten the journey between Taipei and Houston to as little as two and a half hours, a significant decrease from the current 14.5-hour direct flight. The proposed cooperation would focus on suborbital transport, an emerging technology where vehicles briefly exit the Earth's atmosphere before landing. This technology is still in the experimental phase but holds promise for revolutionizing long-distance travel and ultra-fast cargo delivery.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 08:01:07 EDT</div>

          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and maintained its full-year guidance, despite challenges from U.S. auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra stated the company is actively working to significantly reduce its exposure to these tariffs, which had a $1.1 billion impact in the quarter. The automaker is mitigating costs through manufacturing adjustments and targeted initiatives without implementing specific price increases. However, GM's net income and revenue saw year-over-year declines for the first time since late 2023, reflecting the broader economic pressures on the auto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The economic gap between China's two most powerful provinces, Guangdong and Jiangsu, is narrowing significantly, with Jiangsu's GDP now at 97.4% of Guangdong's. In the first half of 2025, the difference shrank to 175.76 billion yuan, the closest margin in years, challenging Guangdong's long-held position as China's top provincial economy. Analysts attribute Jiangsu's resilience to its diversified industrial structure, lower dependence on real estate, and reduced reliance on exports compared to Guangdong. The southern province of Guangdong has seen its export growth slow dramatically, contributing to the closing gap between the two economic powerhouses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic soda sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. This move marks a shift from the high-fructose corn syrup used in its U.S. products since the 1980s. The announcement follows a social media post by President Donald Trump mentioning his discussions with the company about using "REAL Cane Sugar." While so-called "Mexican Coke," which uses cane sugar, has already gained a niche following in the U.S., this new official product launch offers consumers more choice amid ongoing debates about sweeteners.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled its next-generation high-speed rail technology, achieving speeds over the previous 350 km/h barrier while maintaining energy efficiency. Scientists overcame significant aerodynamic resistance by redesigning the train's head shape and adding an undercarriage cover, which together reduced drag by over 24%. This technological advancement comes as the United States has revoked federal funding for California's high-speed rail project, highlighting the contrasting trajectories of the two nations in developing advanced public transportation infrastructure. China's innovation aims to boost speed without a corresponding increase in energy consumption, setting a new standard for rail travel.</p>

D-Wave and IonQ are specialized firms developing distinct quantum technologies, with analysts projecting triple-digit compound annual revenue growth for them through 2027. For a more conservative approach, blue-chip companies like IBM and Microsoft are also making significant strides. IBM has deployed over 80 quantum systems globally, while Microsoft is integrating quantum tools into its Azure cloud platform, offering investors less volatile ways to participate in the industry's long-term potential.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As global temperatures rise and heat waves become more intense, shade is emerging as a critical and democratic tool for public health. The article argues that what clean air and water were to the 20th century, shade infrastructure could be for the 21st. Trees are the most effective solution, as they not only block sunlight but also cool the air through transpiration, making urban environments more livable and reducing heat-related deaths. Where trees are not viable, cities must invest in artificial shade structures like canopies and sails, recognizing that providing shade is a fundamental necessity for adapting to a hotter planet.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is emerging as a dominant political force in Washington, seemingly surpassing the influence of other tech giants like Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's strategic lobbying and the critical importance of Nvidia's AI chips have given him significant sway with the Trump administration. This was recently demonstrated when Nvidia announced it expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a reversal of previous restrictions that Huang had openly argued against. His ability to navigate the complex U.S.-China relationship highlights a shift in the landscape of tech industry power brokers.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that a significant portion of working-class Donald Trump voters could be persuaded to vote for Democrats, but it requires a specific political strategy. The analysis indicates that these voters are often economically egalitarian, supporting policies like a higher minimum wage and job protections, but are socially more moderate than the Democratic base. The study identifies that about 11% of Trump's working-class voters hold these socially moderate and economically progressive views. The article argues that a "social populist" platform, which embraces this combination of attitudes, could be key for Democrats to rebuild a durable working-class majority.</p>
