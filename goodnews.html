          <p>President Trump announced the conclusion of new trade deals with both the Philippines and Indonesia, establishing a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. According to the administration, the agreements will see the Philippines and Indonesia eliminate nearly all tariffs on American goods, creating what Trump described as an "Open Market" for U.S. products. The deal with the Philippines also includes a component of military cooperation. These agreements are part of the administration's broader strategy to renegotiate trade relationships using tariffs as leverage ahead of an August 1st deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team has clinched a 2-1 series victory over England after winning the final One-Day International by 13 runs in a tense match. Despite a valiant 98 from England's captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the hosts fell short of the record 319-run target set by India. The tourists' performance was anchored by a century from their captain, Harmanpreet Kaur, and a decisive six-wicket haul from 21-year-old seamer Kranti Goud. The result marks a significant series win for India and leaves England with questions to address before the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Life sciences firm Danaher delivered second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's modest expectations, with revenue and adjusted earnings per share both topping consensus estimates. The company's performance was a mixed bag geographically, showing slight growth in North America and stronger results in Western Europe, but a decline in China due to new procurement policies. Despite these headwinds, Danaher reiterated its full-year revenue growth outlook and slightly raised its earnings target.

Researchers used the footage to confirm that the fault slipped 8.2 feet in just 1.3 seconds, providing invaluable real-time data on the physics of such powerful seismic events. The analysis confirmed that the rupture was a concentrated, pulse-like burst of energy, deepening scientific understanding of how large earthquakes occur.</p>

Trump has repeatedly attacked Powell for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. The statement may ease market fears of an unprecedented and legally contentious move to oust the head of the nation's independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>
