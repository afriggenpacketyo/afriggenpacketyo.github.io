          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected Q3 revenue of $13.65 billion, signaling a recovery in demand for its core x86 PC processors, which caused its stock to jump 6% in extended trading. This marks the first earnings report since the U.S. government became a top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment. The company projects Q4 revenue of $13.3 billion at the midpoint and is strategically integrating Nvidia's AI graphics processors to revive growth in its data center CPU business. Despite starting advanced chip production in Arizona, Intel's foundry division is still actively seeking a major external customer, indicating ongoing investment challenges.

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco after speaking with Mayor Daniel Lurie and receiving calls from tech leaders like Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff. Mayor Lurie stated that San Francisco is making "substantial progress" with crime rates down significantly, including a nearly 30% citywide reduction and historic lows in violent crime and homicides. The decision follows earlier controversy ignited by Benioff's suggestion for federal intervention, highlighting a unified local effort towards public safety and positive urban development. Governor Gavin Newsom and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the mayor's leadership in resolving the situation.</p>
