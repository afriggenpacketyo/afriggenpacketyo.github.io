        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contrary to the common association of roses with red color. The study, which examined domesticated and wild rose samples, found that the ancestor of modern roses probably had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue. Roses, highly cultivated ornamental flowers, are typically seen as symbols of love and beauty, but the research suggests a different origin for their iconic color.</p>

They note that China's AI models are nearing U.S. versions, with some benchmarks showing DeepSeek's V3 model as superior in non-reasoning tasks. The authors emphasize the need for the U.S. to openly share AI technologies, innovate faster, and promote AI adoption throughout its economy to compete effectively.

The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's aid was estimated at $16.8 billion, a decrease of 10.3% from 2023, primarily due to the yen's depreciation. The OECD reported an overall decline in ODA by Development Assistance Committee members, attributed to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>
