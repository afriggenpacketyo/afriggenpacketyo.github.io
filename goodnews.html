          <p>Actor Ben Stiller opened up about feeling like a "failure" during his separation from wife Christine Taylor, contrasting it with his parents' long marriage. In his new documentary, "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," he explores his parents' comedy duo and the impact of working together on a relationship. Stiller and Taylor separated in 2017 after 17 years but reconciled during the COVID-19 pandemic, moving back into the same house with their children. Taylor also shared her perspective, noting they needed time to grow individually.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have revised their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series, pushing Shohei Ohtani's next start to later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts stated that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will start Game 2 instead, allowing him to maintain his regular rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This strategic shift sacrifices Ohtani's ability to make two starts but provides him with more time to focus solely on his hitting, following a challenging performance in the NL Division Series. The team hopes this adjustment will help Ohtani recalibrate his offensive game.</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia has issued a statement refuting "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan concerning transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. Posts circulating on social media platforms, including Facebook and X, suggested O'Callaghan would boycott the 2028 LA Games if a transgender swimmer competed, and included a provocative statement about sharing a pool with Thomas. Swimming Australia confirmed O'Callaghan had not made such comments and requested the posts be removed. Thomas is currently barred from competing in the female category under World Aquatics guidelines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California is preparing for a "winter-like" storm from late Monday through Wednesday, with the National Weather Service forecasting significant rainfall. Most precipitation is anticipated Monday night into Tuesday afternoon, potentially causing travel disruptions. Rainfall totals could range from three-quarters of an inch to 1½ inches, with mountain and foothill areas possibly receiving up to 3½ inches. Burn areas are under flood watch due to potential heavy rainfall rates. This early-season storm coincides with the official return of La Niña, which typically brings drier winters to the region.</p>

          <p>Arianne Zucker, a long-standing star of "Days of Our Lives," has reached a settlement in her 2024 lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and discrimination on the set of the soap opera. The lawsuit claimed former executive producer Albert Alarr subjected her and other female employees to pervasive harassment. Zucker also alleged retaliation, including reduced pay and her character being written off the show, after voicing concerns. Corday Productions, the show's owner, previously denied the claims, stating Alarr was terminated after an investigation.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has declared the war in Gaza "over" as a ceasefire holds, ahead of a peace summit in Egypt. This comes as Israel expects 20 living hostages to be released by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, recognizing the immense destruction and the need for international cooperation. The UK's Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson's claim of a key UK role in the truce was dismissed by the US ambassador to Israel.</p>

          <p>Maintaining adult friendships often proves challenging amidst life's demands, leading many to lose half their friends every seven years. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco explains this isn't due to incompatibility but shifting life stages, making friendships "collateral damage." Experts advise honest communication, embracing the "mess" of daily life by integrating friends into routines, and prioritizing in-person connections over virtual ones. Overcoming "learned loneliness" and remembering the "liking gap" are crucial. The article suggests reaching out with specific memories and organizing communal activities to foster deeper, more resilient bonds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature serves as an objective measure of stress levels and recovery. This non-invasive technique detects altered blood flow in the face, with the nose cooling as blood is redirected to eyes and ears in a "fight or flight" response. Researchers believe this "nasal dip" could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress, potentially identifying risk markers for anxiety or depression. The method is also being developed to monitor stress in non-communicative individuals, including babies and great apes.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, despite pressure to increase tax revenue. The IFS, a leading economic think tank, warns that some tax rises could be "especially economically harmful" and advocates for wider reform to create a fairer and more growth-friendly tax system. They suggest property tax and capital gains tax reforms as starting points, while cautioning against a wealth tax due to practical challenges. The Treasury states the Budget will balance public service funding with economic growth and investment.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison, is actively pursuing a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming to reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. The potential acquisition, spearheaded by David Ellison of Skydance Media, would consolidate major media assets like HBO, CNN, CBS News, and Warner Bros. studios. This move is driven by Paramount's need for more content to compete with streaming giants and Warner Bros. Discovery's plan to divide its assets, despite having reduced significant debt.</p>
