          <p>In a recent interview, actor Tim Curry reflected on his five-decade career, his iconic roles like Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," and his new memoir, "Vagabond." Curry discussed how acting provided an escape from a difficult childhood and how his villainous characters often channeled his past experiences. He also spoke candidly about the major stroke he suffered in 2012, which left him partially paralyzed and required him to relearn how to speak. Now 79, Curry maintains a philosophical outlook on life and mortality, expressing that he does not fear death and has worked to avoid self-pity throughout his recovery.</p>

          <p>The British government has unveiled a plan to generate 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to train and recruit more workers for roles in renewable, wind, solar, and nuclear power. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that the initiative is essential for developing the UK's domestic energy capacity and lowering household bills in the long term. The strategy includes establishing five "technical excellence colleges," creating programs to match military veterans with green energy careers, and offering tailored training for various groups. The plan aims to double employment in the sector to 860,000 within five years, bringing well-paid industrial jobs to communities across the country.</p>

          <p>An opinion article praises two federal district court judges for blocking the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's justifications, which described the cities as "war-ravaged" and under siege, were "untethered to the facts" and not conceived in good faith. The article contrasts the judges' actions with what it calls the Supreme Court's deference to the president, arguing that the lower court rulings represent a courageous stand for constitutional law over martial law. It calls on the Supreme Court to apply similar scrutiny in upcoming cases involving the administration's use of executive power.</p>

          <h2>UK Energy Secretary Hints at Potential VAT Cut on Energy Bills to Address Cost-of-Living Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 08:59:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested the government is considering cutting the 5% value-added tax (VAT) on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. While not confirming the move, Miliband acknowledged the country faces a significant "cost-of-living crisis" and that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief. This comes as the government faces pressure to fulfill a campaign promise to lower average bills, with prices having recently increased under the latest regulatory price cap. The primary long-term solution, Miliband argued, remains transitioning to home-grown clean energy to reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets.</p>

          <p>Golfer Tommy Fleetwood won his eighth European tour title with a two-shot victory at the DP World India Championship, finishing the tournament at 22 under par. Fleetwood stated that his main motivation during the final round was to win so his eight-year-old son, Frankie, could run onto the 18th green to celebrate with him for the first time. Starting the day two shots behind the leader, Fleetwood carded a seven-under-par 65, including a crucial run of four consecutive birdies, to secure the win. The victory continues a strong season for Fleetwood, which also included a key role in Europe's Ryder Cup victory.</p>

          <p>Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice-minister of finance, expressed confidence that the nation's economy will achieve its growth target of around 5% this year. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China can maintain an annual growth rate of 4.5% to 5% over the next five years. This sustained growth, he argued, will establish a solid foundation for the country to meet its long-term goal of achieving "socialist modernisation" by 2035. Zhu's optimistic forecast comes as Chinese leaders prepare for a key party meeting to finalize the next five-year plan, which will set priorities for navigating economic challenges and geopolitical competition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Medicare's open enrollment period, which runs until December 7, beneficiaries are encouraged to carefully evaluate their health insurance options for the upcoming year rather than automatically renewing their current plans. Experts stress the importance of comparing costs and coverage, especially for prescription drugs and preferred doctors, as plans can change significantly. While the ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information through the 1-800-Medicare hotline, online resources like the Plan Finder portal remain available. Beneficiaries must weigh the trade-offs between original Medicare, which offers flexibility, and Medicare Advantage plans, which often have lower premiums but more restrictive networks.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains How Memory Shapes Personal Narratives and Identity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to neuroscientist Dr. Charan Ranganath, memory functions less like a factual archive and more like a tool for constructing the story of our lives. In a recent interview, he explained that memory is not about perfect recall but about selecting and shaping experiences to understand the present and anticipate the future. Forgetting is an essential part of this process, as it allows the mind to prioritize emotionally significant events and useful information. This means our satisfaction with past events is often determined by the condensed "highlight reel" we remember, not the full experience, highlighting how the narratives we build from our memories are fundamental to our identity and happiness.</p>

          <p>Solar power technology is advancing to allow for electricity generation in a variety of unconventional spaces beyond traditional rooftop panels. Innovations include installing solar modules over parking lots, along roadside noise barriers, and even integrated directly into railway tracks, with a Swiss project aiming to power trains with track-laid panels. Other developments feature solar cells embedded in building facades that are nearly invisible, and agrivoltaics, where panels are mounted on stilts above farmland, providing both electricity and shade for crops. These creative applications significantly expand the potential for clean energy production by utilizing existing infrastructure and land without displacing other essential activities.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are seeing younger, lesser-known players make significant contributions on offense following injuries to key starters. Second-year running back Kimani Vidal, who was not on the initial 53-man roster, excelled in his first start, rushing for 124 yards and scoring a receiving touchdown. Similarly, rookie wide receiver Tre’ Harris has impressed coaches with his consistent effort and crucial blocking in the run game, earning comparisons to former NFL star Anquan Boldin. Both players have demonstrated a "next man up" mentality, finding ways to contribute and proving to be valuable assets for an offense in need of depth.</p>
