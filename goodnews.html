          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 rising almost 3% to a new high, following a coalition government agreement. This market optimism occurred despite China's third-quarter GDP growing by 4.8%, which was in line with analyst expectations. Investors also noted China's decision to keep benchmark lending rates unchanged, contributing to a cautious but positive sentiment across the region. US markets had also closed higher the previous Friday, influenced by a softening tone in US-China trade talks.</p>

          <p>The British military will soon be granted new authority to shoot down drones that pose a threat to military bases, a measure aimed at enabling faster and more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce the introduction of this 'kinetic option,' allowing troops or Ministry of Defence police to neutralize dangerous drones. This development follows multiple drone incursions at British airbases used by US forces and widespread airspace disruptions across Europe. Existing protocols primarily involve diverting drones or disrupting their GPS signals, with lethal force reserved for extreme circumstances.</p>

          <p>Christian McCaffrey delivered an outstanding performance for the San Francisco 49ers, accumulating 201 yards from scrimmage and scoring two touchdowns, as the team defeated the Atlanta Falcons 20-10. McCaffrey's rushing prowess, with 129 yards on the ground, was complemented by his 72 receiving yards. The 49ers' defense also played a crucial role, limiting the Falcons' offense despite San Francisco's injury woes. This victory improved the 49ers' record to 5-2, while the Falcons dropped to 3-3 after a frustrating offensive night.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has publicly acknowledged the possibility of winning his fifth Formula 1 world championship, a significant shift from his previous dismissals. Following a dominant performance at the United States Grand Prix, where he secured pole position and victory in both the sprint and main race, Verstappen has closed the points gap to McLaren's Oscar Piastri to 40. His recent form, including a 64-point gain in four races, is attributed to car upgrades and a better understanding of the vehicle. With five races remaining, the championship battle has intensified, challenging McLaren's earlier season dominance.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, ending two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. Paz's victory comes as Bolivia grapples with its worst economic crisis in decades, including a severe U.S. dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both Paz and his conservative opponent, Jorge Quiroga, campaigned on promises to stabilize the economy, attract foreign investment, and address fuel subsidies. Paz's win signals a potential shift in Bolivia's international alliances, with overtures already made to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of leading LiDAR maker RoboSense, argues that a multi-sensor system is safer and more effective for self-driving vehicles than Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu contends that vision-only systems cannot adequately handle 'corner cases,' such as distinguishing a white car from a cloud or detecting dark vehicles in tunnels, making Level 3 or 4 automation unattainable without additional sensors like LiDAR. While Musk has historically dismissed LiDAR as expensive and unnecessary, Qiu notes its cost has significantly decreased, and other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, consider it 'mission critical.'</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest a simple language shift, replacing 'I can't' with 'I don't,' can help individuals establish stronger boundaries at work and prevent burnout. Career coach Helen Tupper explains that 'I don't' is more definitive and less open to negotiation than 'I can't,' making it easier to decline requests that infringe on personal time. This advice comes as statistics indicate a rising number of workers experiencing high stress and pressure. The article highlights the importance of adjusting goals to current capacity and maintaining a firm routine to complete the 'stress cycle' and enjoy time off.</p>

This year, the Supreme Court permitted the use of 'green crackers' in Delhi, which claim to emit less pollution, though their effectiveness is debated. Beyond fireworks, Diwali involves cleaning and decorating homes, shopping for new clothes, and worshipping Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth.</p>

          <p>As the global secondhand luxury market expands at three times the rate of the firsthand market, authentication has become the paramount factor for credible resale platforms. With the market projected to reach $360 billion by 2030, sophisticated counterfeits, known as 'superfakes,' necessitate robust verification processes. Platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary authentication systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to ensure authenticity. This commitment to verification is boosting consumer trust and driving significant growth in the luxury resale segment, attracting younger shoppers seeking affordability and unique items.

More recently, the 2011-2015 plan's focus on 'strategic emerging industries' like EVs and solar panels established China as a leader in green technology and a near monopoly in rare earth supply chains.
