          <p>Terence Crawford delivered a career-defining performance by dismantling Saúl 'Canelo' Álvarez, becoming the first male boxer in the four-belt era to be an undisputed champion in three different weight classes. Moving up two divisions, Crawford dominated the fight in Las Vegas, solidifying his claim as the greatest fighter of his generation. The victory, broadcast globally on Netflix, elevates Crawford to the pinnacle of the sport, with many now comparing his achievements to those of Floyd Mayweather. For Álvarez, the decisive loss raises questions about his future in the sport.</p>

          <p>As President Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the event casts a spotlight on his own family's immigrant history. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland and emigrated to the United States in the 1920s, part of a wave of "chain migration" that Trump's administration has sought to curtail. She grew up in a small village, speaking Gaelic as her first language, before moving to New York and eventually marrying Fred Trump. This personal history presents a stark contrast to the President's current political stance on immigration.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's government-run tech incubator, Cyberport, is testing graphics processing units (GPUs) from four different mainland Chinese chipmakers for its AI Supercomputing Centre. The move is a strategic effort to decrease its reliance on chips from the American company Nvidia amid ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions. According to its chief executive, Cyberport has been considering this diversification since it began installing Nvidia chips last year. The center's first phase of computing power currently relies entirely on Nvidia, but future procurements will likely include Chinese-made alternatives to ensure supply chain stability.</p>

          <p>Sushila Karki, Nepal's newly appointed interim prime minister, has announced she will hold the position for no more than six months before handing over power to a new government following elections. Her appointment comes in the wake of widespread anti-corruption protests, led by the "Gen Z" movement, that ousted the previous government and resulted in over 70 deaths. Karki, a former Supreme Court chief justice, stated she was compelled to accept the role by public demand for an end to corruption and for good governance. Her interim government now faces the challenge of restoring order and rebuilding key infrastructure ahead of the planned March elections.</p>

          <p>A primary school in the Chinese city of Heihe, located on the border with Russia, has experienced a significant increase in the number of Russian students. A total of 127 new Russian children enrolled this September, joining 89 already studying there, bringing the total to 216. The trend highlights the strengthening people-to-people ties between the two nations amid their deepening political and economic alliance. To accommodate the influx, the school has organized dedicated cross-border transportation and translation services for the students, many of whom commute daily from the Russian city of Blagoveshchensk.</p>

          <h2>New Ladybird Species, Previously Unseen in Britain, Recorded in the New Forest</h2>

          <p>A species of ladybird never before officially recorded in the United Kingdom has been discovered in the New Forest, with its arrival linked to the hot summer weather. The Little Arboreal Ladybird, typically found in France and continental Europe, was identified in moth traps, marking a new addition to the UK Species Inventory. Experts suggest this is part of a broader trend of winged insects colonizing southern England due to warming temperatures. The discovery highlights the impact of climate change on biodiversity and the New Forest's role as a crucial habitat for new arrivals.</p>

An international architectural competition has been launched to design the new space.

          <p>Residents of Henllys, a village in Cwmbran, Wales, were baffled after approximately 20 signs in the area were defaced with the St. George's Cross, the flag of England. The graffiti, which also included swastikas and anti-immigrant text in one location, prompted a community-led cleanup effort. This incident follows a pattern of similar flag paintings across the UK, which some groups claim is about patriotism, but others view as provocative. Local residents and a councillor stated the vandalism represents a minority view and that their collective action to remove it sent a stronger message of unity.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old man from Newport, who maintained the appearance of an ordinary working father, was exposed as the leader of a multi-million pound drug empire selling cocaine and heroin. Police were alerted to Robert Andrews Jr. after discovering messages on another gang leader's phone where they discussed their illicit business. A covert surveillance operation, codenamed Mayland, captured Andrews Jr. conducting large-scale drug and cash exchanges in secluded areas. His eventual arrest and the recovery of his phone provided detailed evidence of his industrial-scale operation, leading to a prison sentence of over 14 years.</p>

          <p>With Irish President Michael D. Higgins's final term ending in November, the race to succeed him is beginning to formalize ahead of the October 24 election. So far, three candidates have secured the necessary nominations to appear on the ballot: independent Catherine Connolly, former Gaelic football manager Jim Gavin, and former cabinet minister Heather Humphreys. The main opposition party, Sinn Féin, has yet to decide if it will field its own candidate or endorse an existing one. Other hopefuls are still seeking the required backing from parliament members or local authorities.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK will be marked by a significant royal "charm offensive," featuring extensive pomp and pageantry hosted by King Charles III. The UK government hopes that this lavish reception, leveraging Trump's known admiration for the monarchy, will serve as a diplomatic tool to advance British interests on issues like trade and Ukraine. Despite significant personal and political differences, King Charles is expected to be a scrupulously correct host, playing a key role in the government's soft power strategy. The visit is tightly controlled, with events held inside the Windsor estate to avoid potential protests.</p>

          <p>While Wall Street strategists are increasingly bullish and raising their targets for the S&P 500, the record-setting market rally is not without significant risks. Analysts are closely watching for potential cracks in the dominant artificial intelligence investment theme that has propelled much of the growth. Other major concerns include the lingering economic damage from President Trump's trade war, the impact of swelling government debt, and signs of a weakening U.S. labor market. Although optimism currently prevails, these factors could combine to create a hard landing for the market if conditions shift. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense, which has struggled in high-leverage situations recently, broke through with a decisive six-run fifth inning to secure a 13-7 victory over the San Francisco Giants. After falling behind early and failing to score with the bases loaded in the second inning, the team mounted a powerful comeback. The rally was keyed by a two-run double from Teoscar Hernández that gave the Dodgers the lead, followed by a string of hits that put the game out of reach. The performance was a much-needed sign of life for the lineup, which capitalized on scoring opportunities and helped the team maintain its lead in the NL West.</p>
