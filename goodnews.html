          <p>The crew of China's Shenzhou-19 mission has revealed that their record-setting spacewalk included an unexpected and challenging repair task. Astronaut Cai Xuzhe explained that a payload adaptor, a crucial docking mechanism for external experiments, became jammed during a cargo installation procedure outside the Tiangong space station. Lacking specialized tools for the unplanned event, the astronauts had to improvise a solution in real-time, collaborating closely with their ground control team. This successful ad-hoc repair highlights the crew's resourcefulness and problem-solving skills under pressure in a high-stakes environment.</p>

          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field near Naval Air Station Lemoore in California, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was unharmed. The aircraft, which belonged to a Navy squadron responsible for training F-35 pilots, went down on Wednesday evening. The incident sparked a small grass fire that was quickly contained, and no other personnel were affected by the crash. Officials have confirmed the pilot's safety and have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the incident involving the advanced military aircraft.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to his starting lineup for the final Test match against the Wallabies in Sydney. With the series already secured, Blair Kinghorn is set to replace James Lowe on the wing, while James Ryan comes into the second-row for Ollie Chessum. The selection emphasizes cohesion, with eleven players having started all three Tests, and features a forward-heavy bench with a six-two split. The decision reflects a focus on finishing the tour strongly rather than providing opportunities for players who have not yet featured in the series.</p>

          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean experienced a significant surge of over 16%, reaching their highest point since 2015. This market rally followed the announcement of a new trade deal between the United States and South Korea, which sets a 15% tariff on Korean exports. The company is expected to benefit from the deal by expanding its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard, contributing to the revitalization of American shipbuilding. The stock's performance was also bolstered by strong second-quarter profits and recent announcements of new orders and global expansion initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the U.S. imposing 25% tariffs on its goods, India has chosen not to rush into a trade agreement, prioritizing the protection of its domestic sectors. New Delhi has particularly resisted U.S. demands for greater market access for American agricultural products, a move intended to safeguard its large population of local farmers who represent a significant political bloc. Analysts suggest India can afford this stance because its exports to the U.S. are a relatively small part of its economy. This strategy aligns with India's broader "multi-alignment" foreign policy, seeking diverse trade partnerships rather than depending solely on Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a busy summer of high-profile signings, 15-year-old attacking midfielder Max Dowman has emerged as a standout performer for Arsenal during their pre-season tour in Asia. The academy player, who first trained with the senior team at 14, has captured attention with his skillful displays in friendlies against AC Milan and Newcastle. His performance against Newcastle was particularly notable, as he won a decisive penalty after a brilliant dribble into the box.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initiated their trade deadline activity with a minor three-team deal involving the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. In the trade, the Dodgers sent minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to the Rays. In return, they acquired promising 21-year-old pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski from the Reds, along with reliever Paul Gervase and catcher Ben Rortvedt from the Rays. While not the major splash some fans anticipated, the move adds a highly-regarded young arm to their farm system. The team is still expected to pursue more significant upgrades before the deadline passes.</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award at the Archibald Prize, Australia's most prestigious portrait competition. Her winning piece is a portrait of Aboriginal musician William Barton, which she painted using only her fingers because a nerve injury made it painful to hold a brush. Spirovski expressed her joy and gratitude for the public's response, calling the award a "beautiful reprieve and reward" after a difficult few years. She created the portrait while listening to Barton's music, finding that painting without a brush was almost painless and allowed her to feel artistically alive again.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that strengthens penalties for individuals who solicit 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense, a charge known as a "wobbler." The bill was controversial, with some Democrats initially raising concerns that it could be used to unfairly target certain communities. After a compromise was reached to add the age-gap stipulation, the bill moved forward and also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election. In a statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now, though she remains committed to fighting for her values. The decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that while she seriously considered the role, her heart wasn't in it, and this decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>With the Major League Baseball trade deadline nearing, several contending teams made significant moves to strengthen their bullpens. The Philadelphia Phillies acquired highly-coveted closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in a major deal involving top prospects. In another flurry of activity, the New York Mets bolstered their relief corps by trading for both Ryan Helsley and Tyler Rogers, whose identical twin brother Taylor was also traded on the same day. These trades signal a hot market for elite relief pitchers as teams position themselves for a postseason run, with other top players still potentially available.</p>
