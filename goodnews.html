          <p>Across the globe, communities gathered throughout June for Pride Month, marking a period of both celebration and continued advocacy for LGBTQ rights and inclusion. The tradition traces its roots to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City, a pivotal moment that catalyzed the modern LGBTQ rights movement. This year's events, from large-scale marches in major cities like New York to gatherings in places like Kathmandu, saw revelers celebrating their identities while also protesting for equality. The article highlights the global nature of these demonstrations through a collection of photographs from various events.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are in a position to make baseball history, with a chance to field an unprecedented eight position players as starters in the upcoming MLB All-Star Game. Following the first phase of voting, the team has finalists at every infield position and two in the outfield. While only three Dodgers led the initial voting, the totals reset for the final 48-hour voting phase, giving all eight an equal opportunity. The current record for the most starters from a single team is five, a mark shared by several historic teams.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law, suggests that the current strained period in US-China relations has historical parallels to the post-1989 era. Speaking after a recent student trip to China, he noted that just as American students began returning to China in the mid-1990s, a similar slow return is happening now after the pandemic. Mahboubi observed an incredibly warm and welcoming reception for his students, indicating a desire for renewed engagement despite high-level political tensions. He believes that these people-to-people connections are crucial and that history suggests the relationship can survive the current rupture.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski delivered a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings in a 5-1 victory against the Kansas City Royals. Coming in as a bulk reliever, Wrobleski allowed just three hits and struck out six, continuing a recent surge that has raised his stock within the organization. After a difficult start to the season, he has improved significantly, particularly with an increase in his fastball velocity. His recent success provides the Dodgers with another promising young arm, adding valuable depth to their pitching staff as they continue their season.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from the Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced significant bipartisan opposition from lawmakers concerned about the privatization of federal lands. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation and recreation advocates celebrated the decision but remain vigilant against future attempts to transfer public lands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The health impact of common seed oils, such as canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, has become a subject of intense debate. Figures like Health Secretary RFK Jr. have labeled them as harmful, contributing to public confusion. However, many nutrition researchers and scientists maintain that the evidence does not support these claims of toxicity. They argue that when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils, which are high in unsaturated fats, can be beneficial for heart health.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an expert analysis on the complexities of Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), using the recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities as a case study. The author argues that initial, hastily leaked reports suggesting minimal damage were likely inaccurate, as a proper BDA takes significant time and integrates multiple intelligence sources. Considering the advanced precision munitions, sophisticated aircraft, and cumulative effects of a prior 12-day Israeli campaign, the author suggests the damage to Iran's nuclear program was likely severe and lasting. This contradicts the early, pessimistic media narratives that followed the strikes.</p>
