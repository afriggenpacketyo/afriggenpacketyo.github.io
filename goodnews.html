          <p>Apple is significantly increasing iPhone production in India, aiming for the country to play a major role in supplying the US market. CEO Tim Cook announced that a majority of iPhones sold in the US will originate from India, with Vietnam producing iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods. This move is designed to mitigate the impact of US tariffs on Apple's supply chains. While this shift presents a big opportunity for India, challenges remain, including cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and supply chain vulnerabilities, requiring careful policy considerations to maximize gains. The article provides an analysis of the implications of Apple's diversification strategy.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations to finalize a post-Brexit deal, covering defense, trade, fishing rights, and youth mobility. Prime Minister Starmer aims to secure a landmark reset in relations with the EU, meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. While government sources indicate significant progress, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticize the deal as a 'surrender' without knowing the full details. The negotiations, led by Nick Thomas-Symonds, focus on cutting red tape for food exports and imports, with potential inclusion of British access to a ‚Ç¨150bn EU defense fund and a youth mobility scheme.

          <p>Japan plans to introduce pre-arrival screening for visa-free travelers in fiscal year 2028 to enhance the efficiency of its booming inbound tourism sector. The government aims to boost tourism to 60 million visitors by 2030. Travelers from countries with visa exemptions will be required to provide personal and travel information in advance, allowing the Immigration Services Agency to examine data for criminal history or illegal stays. This system, modeled after the US ESTA, aims to streamline immigration processes and enhance security, while utilizing digital technologies to eliminate in-person procedures.</p>

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a new deal, but train service will not resume until Tuesday. The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, will end with the resumption of service, benefiting hundreds of thousands of commuters. The agreement, described as fair and fiscally responsible, reflects concessions made by both sides. While the deal is finalized, NJ Transit needs 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment, ensuring the safety of riders before full service restarts.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was diagnosed on Friday with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis is serious, as it is Stage 4, which means it has spread. But the good news, prostate cancer specialists said, is that recent advances in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer have changed what was once an exceedingly grim picture for men with advanced disease. Dr. Judd Moul, a prostate cancer expert at Duke University, said that men whose prostate cancer has spread to their bones, ‚Äúcan live 5, 7, 10 or more years‚Äù with current treatments. The article highlights how the federal research money, with Mr. Biden‚Äôs cancer moonshot effort, in large part led to this progress.</p>
