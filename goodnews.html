          <p>King Charles III's visit to Canada is intended to emphasize Canada's sovereignty amid suggestions from U.S. President Donald Trump about annexation. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. The visit underscores the distinct history and parliamentary system of Canada, differentiating it from the American revolution. Royal historian Carolyn Harris believes Trump will notice the visit, given his admiration for the royal family, and it will highlight the differences between Canada and the U.S.</p>

          <p>Amid market volatility and increasing lifespans, seniors are considering annuities for guaranteed retirement income. Experts recommend immediate annuities for predictable payments, fixed indexed annuities for protected growth, deferred income annuities for longevity planning, and variable annuities for market exposure. Immediate annuities offer longevity insurance and market protection but lack liquidity, while fixed indexed annuities provide principal protection but have capped returns. Deferred income annuities offer higher payouts but lack liquidity and inflation adjustments, while variable annuities offer unlimited upside but come with market risk and high fees.

German carmakers such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen all saw notable increases in their stock prices.

          <p>Japan began selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring prices to around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This move bypasses the auction system, which had limited the government's ability to influence prices. The government seeks to counter criticism that it has failed to prevent rice prices from soaring amid inflation. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency to address public concerns and prevent a decline in rice consumption.</p>

          <p>Anthropologist Sabine Hyland is studying khipus, knotted cords used by the Inca Empire to record information, in the remote village of Jucul in the Peruvian Andes. The khipus, preserved through centuries, may unlock the lost writing system of the Incas, offering insights into their history, culture, and administration. Despite the challenges of deciphering the complex codes of color, fiber type, and knotting patterns, scholars are optimistic about progress due to new technologies and collaborative efforts. If successful, this endeavor could illuminate the origins of writing and the rise and fall of one of the greatest empires in history.</p>
