          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin as the inaugural director of the new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, a veteran in the field, will oversee the county's reorganized approach to homelessness, which involves shifting hundreds of millions of dollars from the criticized Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to the new department. Mahin currently leads the county's Housing for Health program, a model that will be largely absorbed into the new agency, which aims to bring more accountability and direct oversight to the county's homelessness spending and services.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings at the White House to discuss the war in Gaza, amid signs of progress toward a ceasefire. Trump's envoy, Steven Witkoff, indicated that Israel and Hamas are nearing an agreement on a 60-day truce that would include the release of some hostages. While Trump stated talks are "going very well," Netanyahu emphasized the need to "finish the job" against Hamas, and Qatar, a key mediator, has cautioned that more time is needed. The discussions also touched on controversial proposals for relocating Palestinians from Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a two-goal debut, an analysis of João Pedro's performance suggests he may be the solution to Chelsea's long-standing striker issues. The article highlights his versatility, noting he can play deep to link up play and also serve as an attacking focal point, a quality praised by manager Enzo Maresca. Statistical comparisons to other Chelsea forwards show his high involvement across the pitch, with significant touches in both his own and the opposition's half. This all-around contribution, combined with his finishing ability, makes a strong case for him to become a regular starter for the club.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer endorsed online used car retailer Carvana, advising investors that he is a "true believer" in the company for the long term. He praised Carvana's convenient online sales platform and its potential to gain market share in the fragmented auto sales industry. Cramer noted that the company is also positioned to benefit from potential interest rate cuts and new tariffs on foreign automakers, which could make used cars more attractive. While acknowledging the stock's volatility, he suggested investors could start a small position and buy more on any future pullbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints is being eliminated, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced. The policy, which has been in place since 2006, was originally established after Richard Reid attempted to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe in 2001. Officials state the change is possible due to multiple layers of security, including advanced screening technology, which the TSA has been actively developing. The new shoes-on policy is already in effect at some airports and will be implemented nationwide.</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the feasibility of a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific port of Chancay. The proposed 4,500-kilometer railway would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, across the Andes to the Peruvian coast, potentially reshaping South American trade routes to Asia. If constructed, the corridor could significantly shorten shipping times compared to routes using the Panama Canal. The agreement currently covers technical, environmental, and economic studies for the massive infrastructure project, which could take up to five years to complete.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has ended its long-standing policy requiring travelers in standard security lines to remove their shoes, a change now in effect nationwide. The rule was instituted in 2006 following a failed shoe-bombing attempt. While the move is expected to shorten security lines and expedite screening for all passengers, it also raises questions about the value proposition of the TSA PreCheck program, for which shoe-on screening was a major perk. Officials noted that PreCheck still offers advantages, such as not having to remove laptops and liquids from bags.</p>

          <p>The second of two Nevada residents charged with conspiracy to commit voter registration fraud in Minnesota has pleaded guilty in federal court. Ronnie Williams and his co-defendant, Lorraine Lee Combs, were accused of generating fictitious names and data to complete Minnesota voter registration forms between 2021 and 2022. They then allegedly provided these fraudulent forms to an organization that paid them for registering voters. Officials emphasized that the state's extensive verification processes flagged the fraudulent applications immediately, ensuring that no ineligible votes were actually cast in any election.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, on the seafloor of the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The heavy cruiser's bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made by the Ocean Exploration Trust, which used imaging to positively identify the wreckage resting 675 meters deep.</p>
