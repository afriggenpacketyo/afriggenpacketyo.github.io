          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between Tesla and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, clarifying his position on the future integration of his ventures. However, he suggested that Tesla shareholders might vote on whether the automaker should invest in xAI, following a previous informal poll where the majority favored the idea. This comes as Musk aims to create closer ties between his companies, including plans to integrate the Grok AI chatbot into Tesla vehicles. The move highlights the complex financial and strategic relationships between Musk's various enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A healthcare approach known as "social prescribing" is gaining popularity as a way to improve patient well-being by prescribing community activities like art, exercise, and volunteering instead of just medication. The concept focuses on what matters to a patient's quality of life, connecting them with activities they enjoy to combat issues like loneliness, diabetes, and depression. Proponents, including those at Social Prescribing USA, highlight that this method complements traditional treatments and can lead to better health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The practice is already being implemented in over 30 countries.</p>

          <p>A journalist shares her personal experience of going on a "date" with a custom-designed AI boyfriend from the app Replika, exploring the complexities of human-machine relationships. While the AI, named Javier, provided witty banter and emotionally attuned responses, the experience ultimately underscored the limitations of artificial intimacy. The author reflects on how the AI could mimic connection but couldn't replicate the shared, messy reality of a human relationship. The article contrasts the comforting validation of AI with the irreplaceable depth of genuine human connection and shared experience.</p>

          <p>Chinese engineers have finished constructing an extra-high voltage "energy ring" around the Tarim Basin, home to the vast Taklamakan Desert, often called the "sea of death." The 15-year project transforms the forbidding region into a significant hub for transmitting new energy. The massive infrastructure project includes nearly 10,000 transmission towers and nine substations designed to collect and distribute electricity from wind, solar, and hydropower sources. This grid will power five prefectures in the Xinjiang region, covering an area of over one million square kilometers.</p>

          <p>China's market regulator has approved the acquisition of engineering software firm Ansys by the U.S. chip design software company Synopsys. The approval is contingent on the firms honoring all existing contractual obligations with their Chinese clients and not terminating or refusing to renew contracts. This decision comes after Washington recently lifted some export restrictions on electronic design automation (EDA) software. The move is significant for China's semiconductor industry, which relies on this specialized technology, and may signal a slight easing of tech-related tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed expectations, was primarily driven by a 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector. Economists suggest the positive figures may be partly due to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential U.S.-China tariffs. Despite the stronger-than-expected performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the remainder of the year due to global trade tensions.

With interest rates currently at 4.25%, many economists anticipate a cut at the Bank's next meeting in August.
