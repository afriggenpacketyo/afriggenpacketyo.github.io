          <h2>Bartenders Express Frustration Over Gen Z's Trend of Paying for Each Drink Individually</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bartenders are reporting a growing trend among Gen Z customers who prefer to close their tab after every single drink instead of keeping one open for the evening. While some younger patrons cite this as a method for better budget management and monitoring alcohol consumption, bartenders find the practice inefficient and disruptive, especially during busy periods. The habit increases transaction times and adds to the workload, although some in the industry acknowledge the potential benefits of fiscal and personal responsibility for the customer.</p>

          <p>Following their victory in the Euro 2025 final, England's Under-21 football team has demonstrated a promising pipeline of talent for the senior squad ahead of next year's World Cup. Players like Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, who was named player of the tournament, are seen as strong candidates to make the step up. The success marks England's second consecutive U21 European title, reflecting the strength of the country's youth development system. However, history shows that progression to the senior team is not guaranteed for all young champions.</p>

          <h2>Centennial of 1925 Santa Barbara Earthquake Offers Lessons for Modern Seismic Preparedness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One hundred years after a devastating earthquake destroyed downtown Santa Barbara, experts reflect on the lessons it offers for California's seismic preparedness. The 1925 quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, yet it took decades and further tragedies for many cities to mandate retrofits, a problem that persists in some areas today. The event also reshaped Santa Barbara's architectural identity, prompting a city-wide adoption of the Spanish Colonial Revival style, but its historical significance in seismic science was initially downplayed by business interests.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas, a politician from a working-class background, has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), where she will serve alongside Lars Klingbeil. Representing the party's left wing, her election is seen as a move to counterbalance Klingbeil and revitalize the ailing party after a historic election defeat. In her speech, Bas emphasized social solidarity and professional advancement for all, sharply criticizing conservative calls to cut social benefits. She was elected with 95% of the delegate vote, a strong mandate for a difficult task.</p>

          <p>During a match against Western Force, the Perth stadium announcer singled out several British and Irish Lions players born in the southern hemisphere, including New Zealand-born Irish winger James Lowe. The announcer's comments followed remarks by Australia's coach about the Lions' diverse ancestries, which some have interpreted as mind games. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, responded with humor, stating he has been teased his whole career and that the gag can continue if the team keeps winning.</p>

          <p>Jim Rowley, the 58-year-old CEO of Crunch Fitness, credits a four-part routine for maintaining his health and feeling younger as he ages. His regimen includes Pilates twice a week for core strength and mobility, weightlifting with dumbbells for better range of motion, and walking 10,000 steps daily for low-impact cardio. He also utilizes a curated supplement stack, with creatine being a key component for muscle and brain health. Rowley emphasizes that long-term fitness is about functionality, balancing strength, mobility, and cardiovascular health rather than lifting for ego.</p>

          <p>Jake Paul defeated former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by unanimous decision in a boxing match that saw the Mexican fighter start slowly.

After the bout, Paul declared it the start of his "real" boxing career, moving beyond his YouTuber origins, and expressed a desire to avenge his previous loss to Tommy Fury.</p>
