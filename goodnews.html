          <p>As the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches, this article examines China's transformation from a key Allied power to a nation often portrayed as a revisionist threat to the global system. Despite an estimated 35 million Chinese casualties during the war, its contributions are often overlooked in Western narratives. The analysis suggests that Beijing now seeks to position itself as a primary guarantor of the post-war international order it helped create. This perspective challenges the common framing of China's rise as an inherent threat to the existing global security architecture.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, forecasting continued strong sales growth driven by demand for its artificial intelligence chips. Despite the positive overall results and a projection of over 50% revenue growth for the next quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight decline in after-hours trading. This dip was attributed to data center revenue falling just short of analysts' specific estimates for the second consecutive period. The report confirms the central role of Nvidia's technology in the ongoing global AI infrastructure expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kinloch Castle, a landmark Victorian hunting lodge on the Scottish Isle of Rum, is back on the market for offers over £750,000. The sale, managed by the government agency NatureScot, follows the collapse of a previous deal amid a dispute between a potential buyer and a Scottish government minister. The castle is in a state of disrepair, and the local community has expressed a desire for any new owner to be committed to supporting the island's economy and nature. The sale presents a unique opportunity for a buyer to restore a significant piece of Scottish heritage.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla avoided directly answering questions about a potential run for California governor in 2026, stating his current priority is a November special election on congressional redistricting. During a political summit, Padilla emphasized the importance of the ballot measure, which aims to counter Republican-led redistricting efforts in other states. However, he did not rule out a gubernatorial campaign, highlighting his extensive experience in California politics at various levels of government. His name has recently emerged as a possible contender in a field that remains wide open.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officialized the rivalry between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres with a new trophy: a custom Fender Telecaster guitar named the "Vedder Cup." The trophy is named for Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, who has strong ties to both cities and personally played the instrument before it was designated as the prize. The Mariners won the inaugural cup by taking the season series against the Padres. The initiative also aims to raise awareness for a nonprofit co-founded by Vedder that funds research for a rare skin disorder.</p>

          <p>A potential blackout of Fox channels for millions of YouTube TV subscribers has been temporarily avoided after the two companies agreed to a short-term contract extension. The previous agreement was set to expire, threatening viewer access to Fox News, sports, and local stations just as the popular college and NFL football seasons begin. The dispute centers on the programming fees that YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, which Google claims are unfairly high. While talks continue, the extension ensures that major sporting events, like the Texas vs. Ohio State game, will remain available to subscribers for now.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut looking highly probable for September, savers with Certificates of Deposit (CDs) should act strategically to lock in current high rates. Financial advisors recommend shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher returns than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It is also crucial for savers to accurately determine the amount they can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties. To maximize returns in a falling-rate environment, experts suggest securing the longest-term CD that fits within one's financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing financing, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) presents a compelling option this September due to several favorable conditions. HELOCs currently offer some of the lowest borrowing rates compared to personal loans and credit cards, and the interest may be tax-deductible. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs are likely to decrease further, making them even more affordable. Additionally, record-high home equity levels mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision avoids the complexities of a player-captain role, which has not been seen at the Ryder Cup since Arnold Palmer.
