        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has unveiled a proposal for a new seven-year budget totaling 2 trillion euros, which includes a significant fivefold increase in defense and space funding. The plan allocates 131 billion euros to these sectors as part of a new European Competitiveness Fund designed to bolster regional investment. Approximately 35% of the total budget is earmarked for climate and biodiversity initiatives, with the EU looking to introduce new revenue streams to fund the framework without increasing member state contributions. The proposal must now be approved by the European Parliament and member states, with some officials already expressing concerns that the budget is too high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has emerged as a potential influence on President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine, according to recent presidential comments. The president revealed that his wife has repeatedly highlighted Russia's continued aggression, contrasting it with Vladimir Putin's diplomatic assurances. This has led to a wave of positive attention on Ukrainian social media, where she has been dubbed "Agent Melania Trumpenko" and praised for her perceived support. The article notes that while her influence is being discussed, the U.S. has resumed arms exports to Ukraine, but on the condition that European partners bear the cost.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have decided to protect the U.S.-backed global HIV/AIDS program, PEPFAR, from a broader government spending reduction effort. Lawmakers plan to remove a proposed $400 million cut to the program, which was part of a larger $9 billion rescissions package targeting areas like international aid and public broadcasting. The move came after several senators from both parties expressed concern over cutting funds for PEPFAR, a program widely credited with saving millions of lives, particularly in Africa. The White House has reportedly agreed to the amendment, which is seen as a significant reversal amid the administration's push to decrease government spending.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin man, initially the primary suspect in his girlfriend's 2016 death, was cleared after data from his Fitbit provided a crucial alibi. Doug Detrie was arrested after his girlfriend, Nicole Vander Heyden, was found beaten and strangled, with initial evidence pointing towards him. However, his fitness tracker showed minimal movement during the night of the murder, corroborating his story that he was asleep at home. This technological evidence, along with data from the victim's car, shifted the investigation, leading to the identification and conviction of another man, George Burch, whose own phone data placed him at the crime scenes.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's parliament has officially accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who has been the longest-serving individual in that role in the country's history. The dismissal was supported by 261 lawmakers and dissolves the entire Cabinet of Ministers as part of a major government reshuffle. The changes are intended to recalibrate Ukraine's economic and defense strategies amid the ongoing war with Russia. Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko is widely expected to be appointed as the new prime minister, while Shmyhal may transition to the role of defense minister.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has decided to ease export restrictions on certain advanced artificial intelligence chips to China, a move experts see as a positive signal in bilateral trade negotiations. The Commerce Department is set to resume reviewing license applications for specific AI chips from companies like Nvidia and AMD. This development is viewed as a significant concession by Washington, potentially resetting the tone of high-level talks and steering relations away from recent technological and trade standoffs. The decision comes ahead of further discussions between senior officials from both nations, suggesting a potential move toward more cooperative economic dialogue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ryan Peake is making his major championship debut at The Open, a remarkable turnaround for a man who was in prison when the tournament was last held at Royal Portrush in 2019. A talented junior golfer, Peake drifted away from the sport and joined an outlaw motorcycle gang, which led to a five-year sentence for serious assault. While incarcerated, he reconnected with his former coach and decided to turn his life around, dedicating himself to golf once again. His victory at the New Zealand Open secured his spot at The Open, completing a unique and challenging journey from a prison cell to one of golf's most prestigious events.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, rose on Wednesday amid renewed investor optimism that key stablecoin legislation could pass the House this week.

President Trump later indicated that House Republicans who had blocked the bill have since changed their minds after a White House meeting. Analysts suggest the bill's eventual passage is likely, which would provide much-needed regulatory clarity and could further bolster the crypto ecosystem, particularly for stablecoin issuers and related platforms.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) be renamed "physician assistants" to clarify their role and prevent confusion with fully qualified doctors. The review, commissioned after safety concerns were raised, also suggests PAs should wear distinct uniforms and only see new patients with minor ailments after they have been triaged. This follows cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. The government has accepted all recommendations, aiming to ensure patients are confident about the qualifications of their healthcare providers.</p>
