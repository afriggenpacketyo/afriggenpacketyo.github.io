          <p>Elon Musk is departing from his role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, a position limited to 130 days. Musk thanked President Trump on X, noting his Department of Government Efficiency team will continue its work. Despite leaving his official role, a senior administration official stated that Musk will continue to serve as an unofficial advisor to the president and may attend White House meetings. This comes after Musk made outspoken comments about Trump's agenda and policy, which reportedly frustrated senior White House officials.</p>
