          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations that it violated the data privacy rights of Texas residents. According to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, the lawsuit, filed in 2022, accused Google of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data, including movements, searches, voiceprints, and facial geometry. Google stated that the settlement addresses old claims related to product policies that have since been changed and that they are committed to building robust privacy controls into their services. Paxton hailed the settlement as a major win for Texans' privacy, sending a message that companies will be held accountable for abusing trust.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered her release, stating that her continued detention could chill the speech of millions of non-citizens. Ozturk had been detained since March, accused by the Department of Homeland Security of supporting Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization, allegedly based on an op-ed critical of Israel she co-authored in a Tufts student newspaper. The judge found no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence and emphasized the importance of protecting First Amendment rights for non-citizens. The ACLU, representing Ozturk, expressed delight at her release, underscoring the principle that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs.</p>

          <p>Virtual care company Omada Health filed for an IPO on Friday, the latest digital health company that's signaled its intent to hit the public markets despite a turbulent economy. Revenue increased 57% in the first quarter to $55 million, up from $35.1 million during the same period last year, the filing said. The San Francisco-based company generated $169.8 million in revenue during 2024, up 38% from $122.8 million the previous year. Omada contracts with employers, and the company said it works with more than 2,000 customers and supports 679,000 members as of March 31.  The IPO market has been largely dormant across the tech sector for the past three years, and within digital health, it's been almost completely dead.</p>

          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh have been cut off from revision resources ahead of key exam dates following an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff identified a suspicious meeting invitation as a "spear-phishing" attempt, impersonating a trusted source, leading to the precautionary resetting of passwords for all users. The council said no data had been compromised and that students currently sitting exams would be given priority support. This follows a suspected criminal ransomware cyberattack on schools in West Lothian earlier in the week, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of educational institutions to cyber threats.</p>

          <p>Chinese buyers have purchased between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks due to concerns that a heatwave may damage crops in China‚Äôs agricultural heartlands. Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning due to hot, dry weather. The purchases from Australia are the first by China from the country since last year. Despite these purchases, there is no guarantee that more will follow, as China has large wheat inventories and faltering economic growth is depressing demand for grains.</p>

This pageant of puppetry includes a flutter of butterflies, a goat with a plaintive bleat, a menagerie of wild animals and, at one point, a school of glowing fish. The story revolves around the survival at sea of a 17-year-old boy named Pi Patel (a mesmerizing Taha Mandviwala) after the Japanese cargo ship transporting his family sinks en route to Canada. The staging transitions in dreamlike fashion from the hospital to Pondicherry, India, where Pi grew up in a happy, hectic ferment of adolescence.</p>

The 54-year-old called it the "most difficult" campaign in his time in coaching, adding: "When you don't win, it's more demanding in terms of emotionally and preparing [the team] and the mood.

His capture in Mexico and subsequent deportation to Guatemala resulted from joint efforts between the two countries and the United States.
