          <p>Columbia University will pay over $221 million to resolve federal investigations into alleged anti-discrimination law violations, specifically concerning antisemitism on campus. The settlement, paid over three years, also resolves claims from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In return, the Trump administration will restore $400 million in federal research grants that had been withheld. The agreement formalizes new campus policies, including a ban on masks intended to conceal identity and a requirement for protestors to show university IDs, aiming to move past a period of intense federal scrutiny.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix reported a record-breaking second-quarter operating profit and revenue, fueled by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in artificial intelligence systems. The company's revenue rose over 35% year-over-year, with HBM sales contributing 77% of the total. SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, expects to double its HBM sales in 2025 compared to 2024 and plans to increase capital expenditure to maintain its market leadership. Analysts believe the company will maintain its edge over competitors like Samsung and Micron into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive "AI Action Plan" aimed at establishing U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by boosting innovation and removing regulatory barriers. The plan includes over 90 policy actions and is accompanied by executive orders to promote AI exports and eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI systems. While officials frame it as a crucial step to outpace China, critics from groups like the AI Now Institute argue the plan prioritizes corporate interests and tech billionaires over public welfare. The plan notably reverses a prior executive order that had established safety standards for AI.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has declared President Trump's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. In a significant ruling, a panel of judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals stated the policy is invalid because it directly contradicts the 14th Amendment. The amendment grants citizenship to 'all persons born in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' This decision marks the first time an appellate court has ruled on the merits of the president's attempt to curtail birthright citizenship for children of many undocumented immigrants through executive action.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a unanimous advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions originating within their jurisdiction. The ruling, prompted by a request from the island nation of Vanuatu, clarifies that existing international laws and treaties compel nations to act with due diligence and provide reparations for climate-related damages. While not legally binding, the opinion sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence thousands of climate litigation cases worldwide and strengthen the position of vulnerable nations in climate negotiations.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. This interaction creates "space weather," which can disrupt GPS, communication signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts. The identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing researchers to precisely measure how energy from the sun couples with Earth's magnetosphere. The mission aims to improve understanding and prediction of these phenomena to better protect critical ground-based and space assets. Several other small experimental satellites were also deployed during the same launch.</p>

          <p>South Korea has narrowly avoided a technical recession, with its economy growing by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, beating economists' expectations. The expansion reverses a 0.2% contraction from the previous quarter and was driven by a rise in both private and government consumption, as well as strong export growth in semiconductors and chemical products. On a year-over-year basis, GDP rose 0.5%. The positive data comes as the country faces potential U.S. tariffs and the Bank of Korea holds interest rates steady to focus on financial stability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are starting their training camp regarded as a strong Super Bowl contender, but face several key concerns. Quarterback Matthew Stafford is dealing with back soreness, though coach Sean McVay downplayed its severity. The offensive line is a major question mark, with left tackle Alaric Jackson sidelined by blood clots for a second time and right tackle Rob Havenstein recovering from shoulder surgeries. Other issues include the depth at cornerback and the unresolved contract situation for star running back Kyren Williams, who is entering the final year of his rookie deal.</p>
