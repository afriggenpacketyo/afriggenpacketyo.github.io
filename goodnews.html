          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally urged Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to grant him the authority to appoint peers to the House of Lords. Farage contends that the current composition of the upper chamber exhibits a 'democratic disparity,' as Reform UK, despite its significant popular vote in the general election and recent local government gains, lacks any representation there. This contrasts with smaller parties that have numerous peers. While the Prime Minister holds discretion, a Downing Street spokesperson noted that appointments adhere to long-standing conventions and commission advice. Defence Secretary John Healey criticized Farage's request, citing his previous advocacy for abolishing the House of Lords.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 05:17:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of young Chinese scientists from Tsinghua University, led by Associate Professor Duan Ran, has developed a new approach that promises to overcome a 40-year-old mathematical barrier in theoretical computer science. Their research addresses the 'single-source shortest-paths' problem (SSSP), which traditionally relied on Dijkstra’s algorithm but faced speed limits due to its sorting process. The new method bypasses this by focusing only on the shortest distance between key points, significantly reducing calculation time. This development, published on arXiv and awarded the Best Paper Award at the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, marks a notable advancement in computational efficiency.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reiterated strong support for the country's private sector, emphasizing the need to guarantee a level playing field and safeguard entrepreneurs' lawful rights and interests. In a speech, details of which were recently released, Xi called for the solid and thorough implementation of policies to promote private economy development, without 'ambiguity, delay, or compromise.' He acknowledged that many private businesses report limited tangible benefits from previous relief policies, stressing the importance of enhanced policy precision and equal treatment for all eligible enterprises. This move aims to address long-standing challenges like overdue payments and boost confidence.</p>

          <p>Two easyJet planes clipped wings on the runway at Manchester International Airport in the UK on Friday morning, prompting a brief suspension of operations. An airport spokesperson confirmed the incident, stating that the planes were assessed and able to taxi back to a stand, allowing normal operations to quickly resume after a few minutes. This type of ground incident, while rare, can cause significant delays. Crucially, there have been no reports of any injuries among passengers or crew. Authorities at the airport are currently investigating the cause of the contact, and easyJet is managing arrangements for affected passengers to minimize further disruption.</p>
