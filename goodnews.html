          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is set to attend an international peace summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, on Monday to sign a Gaza peace plan. The summit, led by US President Donald Trump and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, aims to finalize the first phase of a ceasefire agreement and hostage return deal. This initial phase requires Hamas to release Israeli hostages and Israel to free Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased aid to Gaza. Future phases, addressing governance and troop withdrawal, are expected to be challenging to negotiate.</p>

          <p>China's launch of a commercial underwater data center in Hainan marks a significant stride in its bid for AI leadership. However, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart these plans, citing the rapid data center expansion in the UAE and US. The Trump administration has facilitated multi-billion-dollar chip supply deals with the UAE, fostering a robust, US-technology-driven data ecosystem. This dynamic highlights China's capital constraints compared to the US, which is strategically investing in semiconductor companies to accelerate data center production. The article emphasizes the competitive landscape in the global data center industry.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team, though underdogs, has begun the World Cup unbeaten, largely due to standout performances from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and spinner Sophie Ecclestone. Sciver-Brunt's century against Sri Lanka, a record fifth World Cup century, and her return to bowling have revitalized the team. Ecclestone, the world number one spinner, has also been instrumental, taking four wickets against Sri Lanka. While England has capitalized on favorable fixtures, their dominant duo has sent a clear message to upcoming rivals India and Australia, despite some middle-order batting wobbles. The article highlights their impressive form.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for an early season storm next week, with widespread and beneficial rainfall anticipated, peaking on Tuesday. The National Weather Service predicts 0.5 to 1.5 inches for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, with up to 3 inches in mountainous areas. This unusually deep low-pressure system will also bring significantly cooler temperatures and southwest wind gusts. While minor road flooding is expected, the storm is unlikely to end wildfire season. There is a remote risk of severe storms or tornadoes, and potential for flash flooding in burn scar areas.</p>

          <p>The Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva is meticulously preparing to receive Israeli hostages freed from Gaza, developing a new field of "captivity medicine." Dr. Michal Steinman, head of nursing, emphasizes the need for a "medical detective" approach to understand the long-term physical and psychological impacts of captivity. The unit prioritizes giving hostages space and time for recuperation, with private rooms designed for comfort and family reunification. Medical teams are learning from previous hostage releases, recognizing that symptoms can manifest weeks later, and addressing complex needs ranging from nutrition to mental health support.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old British army horse, has been retired to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire after sustaining serious injuries during a runaway incident in London last year. Quaker was one of five Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment horses spooked by construction noise, galloping through the streets and colliding with vehicles. The incident resulted in injuries to four people and five soldiers, with two horses photographed bleeding. Major Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker's inability to return to duties due to ongoing veterinary care, emphasizing that his retirement was for his welfare.</p>

          <p>SNP members have backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party secures a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election. Swinney presented this as the most realistic path, citing the precedent for the 2014 referendum. This endorsement comes despite a rejected amendment that would have treated the election as a de-facto independence vote based on pro-independence parties' list ballot share. Swinney affirmed his commitment to delivering independence for Scotland, while acknowledging the significant challenge of winning a majority and potential UK government resistance.</p>

          <h2>Gen Z Drives Pushback Against 'Fast Furniture' Towards Sustainable Choices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Generation Z consumers are increasingly rejecting 'fast furniture'—cheap, mass-produced decor designed for short lifespans—in favor of secondhand and durable items. This shift is driven by growing awareness of furniture's massive carbon footprint, with over 95% of consumed furniture globally being discarded. Unlike fast fashion, furniture often contains mixed materials making it difficult to recycle. Young consumers are turning to platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest for sustainable options, valuing the emotional connection and investment required to refresh older pieces. The article highlights this trend as a crucial antidote to the environmental toll of disposable home decor.</p>
