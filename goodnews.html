          <p>BTG Pactual, a major Brazilian investment bank, is exploring opportunities for expansion in Asia, with a potential new office in Hong Kong. This move is driven by increasing demand for data centers among Chinese AI firms, as trade and investment ties between China and Brazil grow stronger despite global trade tensions with the U.S. BTG's partner, Jo√£o Scandiuzzi, mentioned that many Chinese companies, especially in the electricity sector, seek investments in Brazil through them, highlighting the importance of fostering the Brazil-China relationship. BTG previously had an investment office in Hong Kong but closed it around 2015 after former UBS personnel left. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An advice columnist for Vox explores the ethical dilemma of students using AI to cheat in humanities courses. The author argues that the true value of humanities education lies in the formation of human persons and the cultivation of virtues like practical wisdom, rather than simply producing academic work. She suggests that educators should be honest with students about the real benefits of a humanities education and offer them choices about using AI, while also incorporating reflection exercises to promote critical thinking. By adding cognitive friction back into the learning process, educators can help students develop the reasoning skills they need to navigate the complex ethical challenges posed by emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize its airspace, potentially leading to quicker flights, fewer delays, and reduced climate change impacts. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign flight paths, many of which were established 70 years ago, to allow planes to climb and descend more smoothly. Aviation Minister Mike Kane stated that modernizing airspace is a simple way to reduce pollution from flying and prepare the industry for sustainable technologies like flying taxis. While the changes are not expected to take effect for several years, industry leaders have expressed support for the initiative, emphasizing the need for swift action.</p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung is projected to win the country's snap presidential election. Lee's eligibility for the presidency was in doubt after he was charged with breaching election laws, but a final ruling on the case had been postponed until after the election by South Korea's High Court. Eurasia predicts that if Lee is elected, he will contend with the dual challenges of reviving South Korea's economy and completing a "package" agreement with the U.S. by July. Goldman Sachs noted that both the PPP's Kim and DP's Lee share similarities in their goals, including economic growth, stable financial markets and improving housing affordability.</p>
