Initially available only to paid subscribers, Comet is designed to function as a personal assistant for tasks like web searching, tab organization, and email drafting. The move to make the browser free is seen as a strategic effort to compete with established tech giants like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, which have also integrated AI agents into their browser offerings. Perplexity aims to attract a broad user base while continuing to develop new features, including a mobile version.</p>

          <p>Shares of chipmaker Intel have risen dramatically, climbing over 50% in the last month to their highest level in 18 months. This surge has increased the value of the U.S. government's 10% stake in the company to approximately $16 billion. The government's investment was part of a strategic move by the Trump administration to bolster domestic chip manufacturing, funded by grants from the CHIPS and Science Act. The stock's recovery is also attributed to new leadership and significant investments from other major tech companies like Nvidia, signaling renewed confidence in the formerly struggling semiconductor giant.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has signaled strong optimism regarding upcoming trade talks with China, anticipating a "big breakthrough" in the economic relationship between the two nations. He highlighted a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping as a critical moment for resolving ongoing disputes over tariffs and trade practices. The positive forecast comes as both countries continue to work towards a lasting agreement following an extended trade war ceasefire. Bessent also suggested that financial aid for American soybean farmers, who have been impacted by the tariffs, could be announced very soon.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $90,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable compared to earlier this year. Calculations show that a 10-year loan at current rates would cost approximately $1,108 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $871 per month. While these payments are lower than they were in early 2025, the article notes that the decrease is not dramatic. Homeowners are advised to carefully consider their ability to make payments, as the home serves as collateral, and to compare options like HELOCs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Musician Erykah Badu is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her seminal sophomore album, “Mama’s Gun,” which she released in 2000 during a period of significant personal and professional transition. In a recent interview, Badu reflected on the album as a "metaphorical diary" that solidified her place as a leading voice in R&B and hip-hop. To mark the occasion, she is launching a new tour, "The Return of Automatic Slim," and continues to create new music, including an upcoming collaborative album with producer The Alchemist. Badu states that the messages in "Mama's Gun" still resonate and guide her evolution as an artist today.</p>

          <h2>New Analysis Explores the Hidden Environmental and Social Costs of Mining for the Green Transition</h2>

          <p>A new book, "Extraction" by Thea Riofrancos, examines the significant, often overlooked, costs associated with the green energy transition, particularly the mining of essential minerals like lithium and cobalt. The article discusses how this extraction disproportionately harms Indigenous and poor communities through water contamination, displacement, and economic disruption. Riofrancos argues that the perceived paradox of harming the environment to save it is a false choice created by a limited vision. Instead of simply replacing gas cars with electric ones, she advocates for systemic changes like robust mass transit, which could reduce mineral demand.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from Purdue University believes they may have located the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's lost Electra 10E aircraft in a lagoon on the remote Pacific island of Nikumaroro. They have identified a "visual anomaly," visible in satellite imagery dating back to 1938, which they plan to investigate in an upcoming expedition. The team will use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object for identification. If confirmed, the discovery would solve the 88-year-old mystery of Earhart's disappearance and could lead to the plane's return to Purdue University, which originally funded the aircraft.</p>

          <p>With average 30-year fixed mortgage rates falling to 6.34% from nearly 7% at the start of the year, the cost of borrowing has decreased for homebuyers. For a $700,000 mortgage, this rate drop translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $4,351, which is about $273 less per month than it would have been in January. Over the full 30-year term, this difference could save a borrower nearly $100,000 in total interest.

          <p>Fair Isaac (FICO), the company behind the widely used credit scoring system, has announced a major change to its business model, causing its stock to rally over 20%. The new plan will allow mortgage lenders to license FICO scores directly from the company, bypassing the three major credit bureaus—Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax—which traditionally acted as intermediaries. This move is intended to eliminate markups and give lenders more choice. Consequently, shares for the credit bureaus fell, as investors speculated the change could diminish their role in the mortgage lending process. (not investment advice)</p>
