          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider raising taxes before the Spring Statement. The memo proposed measures to increase taxes by ¬£3-4 billion annually, including raising corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, scrapping the tax-free allowance on dividends, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While these proposals were not implemented, they highlight ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions, especially concerning welfare cuts and defense spending. Conservative Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized the memo, stating it confirmed the Labour Party was still debating which taxes to increase next.</p>

          <p>President Trump pressured House Republicans to unite behind a wide-ranging bill to deliver his domestic agenda, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Despite initial resistance, negotiations with key holdouts appeared to yield some progress, as Speaker Mike Johnson worked to secure support from various factions within the party. The bill includes provisions to extend the 2017 tax cuts, increase military and immigration enforcement spending, and cut Medicaid and other social programs. However, disagreements persist over issues like Medicaid changes and state and local tax deductions, creating challenges for Republican leaders in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

          <p>President Trump is involving America's business titans in his efforts to bolster his image both domestically and internationally. Corporate leaders are spending more time currying favor with the administration to gain relief from regulations and tariffs.

However, aligning with Trump doesn't guarantee protection from his anger, as companies like Apple and Amazon have experienced.
