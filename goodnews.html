          <p>Actress Sarah Jessica Parker recently shared that she used to live on a tight budget of $40 for three days when she was 18, an experience that taught her the value of financial security. While her method was restrictive, a financial advisor in the article suggests that modern freelancers and gig workers should focus on building a system to handle income volatility rather than just rationing. The article recommends a "bucketing strategy," allocating income by percentage to essentials, savings, and wants, and emphasizes building an emergency fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Republican Study Committee, a large conservative caucus in the House, has initiated a working group to begin drafting a second major budget reconciliation bill to advance President Trump's agenda. This effort follows the successful passage of the first "big, beautiful bill" which made tax cuts permanent and imposed new work requirements. RSC Chairman August Pfluger stated the goal is to build on the momentum to lower the cost of living and restore America's promise. The move signals that GOP leaders are planning for multiple legislative pushes to enact their policies while they control Congress and the White House.</p>

          <p>In an economy with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to earn returns that can outpace the inflation rate. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some one-year terms exceeding 4.40% APY. The article suggests that savers can find the best rates by looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve.

          <p>For those looking to buy a home or refinance, current mortgage rates remain a key factor, with 30-year mortgage averages hovering around 6.79%. The article notes that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit scores, pay bills on time, and shop around with different lenders. A potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could also bring relief to borrowers, but the overall market remains challenging due to high rates and limited housing inventory.

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low, high-yield savings accounts offered primarily by online banks provide a powerful tool for growing emergency funds. Top accounts currently offer rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, significantly outpacing traditional savings vehicles and helping to counteract the effects of inflation. The article advises consumers to compare different high-yield options, paying attention to both interest rates and any associated fees. Financial planners emphasize the importance of having an accessible fund for unexpected expenses to avoid relying on high-interest debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold continues to be a popular safe-haven asset, particularly during periods of economic and market uncertainty, with its price recently standing at $3,367.65 per ounce. The value of this precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. The article explains that gold often acts as a hedge against inflation, and its price can be inversely related to interest rates. Investor sentiment and the policies of central banks also play a significant role in its short-term price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The defense ministers of Germany and France have committed to clarifying the path forward for the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) by the end of the year amid corporate disputes over work-sharing. French company Dassault Aviation has expressed frustration with delays caused by disagreements with Airbus, which represents German and Spanish interests. The ministers acknowledged that while partner companies have their own interests, the project must prioritize Franco-German cooperation over national egotism. The goal is to ensure the next-generation defense system, including a new fighter jet, meets its operational deadline around 2040.</p>

          <p>France's recent announcement that it will recognize a Palestinian state makes it the first G7 country to do so and the 148th nation overall. The majority of countries worldwide already acknowledge the State of Palestine, a trend that began in 1988 after the PLO's declaration of independence. While over 140 UN members support Palestinian statehood, full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. Key Western powers like the U.S., Canada, and Germany maintain that recognition should only come as part of a comprehensive peace agreement with Israel, a stance that is now being challenged by France's move.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which includes a nearly $9 billion investment in icebreakers, is intensifying the geopolitical debate over polar shipping routes. As global warming makes the Northern Sea Route more navigable, the U.S. aims to reassert its presence in the region. Chinese scholars argue that this presents a strategic opportunity for China, a self-declared "Near-Arctic State," to develop these more efficient shipping lanes. They view the Arctic routes as a potential new pathway to counter what they describe as U.S. geopolitical containment, highlighting the growing economic and strategic importance of the rapidly changing region.</p>

          <p>Gated communities in the United States, particularly prevalent in states like Florida and California, are evolving to serve a wide range of lifestyles and budgets, not just the wealthy or retired. While security and controlled access are key features, the main draw for many residents is the array of high-end amenities like golf courses and concierge services. Homes in these communities typically cost 5% to 20% more than comparable non-gated homes and come with mandatory HOA fees for upkeep. Despite the higher cost, these properties often see higher appreciation rates, making them a popular choice in the real estate market.</p>

          <p>Under new regulations from the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, approximately 6,000 websites that allow pornographic content are required to begin verifying that their users are over 18. This measure is part of the Online Safety Act, aimed at improving child safety online. Major platforms including Pornhub, Reddit, and X (formerly Twitter) have committed to implementing age checks. While regulators and children's charities have praised the move as a significant step, some experts express skepticism about how easily these checks can be circumvented and raise concerns about data privacy and the impact on marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>Manchester City is set to re-sign 22-year-old goalkeeper James Trafford from Burnley for £27 million, just two years after selling him. The club activated a buy-back and matching rights clause after Newcastle submitted a bid for the promising keeper, who impressed during Burnley's promotion-winning season. Trafford, a City academy graduate, is expected to sign a five-year contract and will provide competition for current number one, Ederson. The move gives City a formidable lineup of four goalkeepers but also raises questions about the future of Ederson and backup Stefan Ortega at the club.</p>
