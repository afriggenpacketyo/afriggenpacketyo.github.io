          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) to advocate for a more 'equal and orderly' multipolar world. Speaking at a meeting in Tianjin, he criticized hegemonism and protectionism, in a veiled reference to the United States, stating certain countries prioritize selfish interests over the international community. Wang emphasized the need for the Eurasian security bloc to defend fairness, promote inclusive economic globalization, and build a more just global governance system. The SCO was originally formed by China and Russia with Central Asian states to focus on regional security and counter-terrorism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dispute is intensifying among German states over the country's summer holiday calendar, with several states demanding an end to what they see as an unfair advantage for Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg. These two southern states always begin their summer break last, allowing their residents to travel during less crowded and expensive periods. Other states, which rotate their holiday schedules annually, argue this system is no longer fair and creates travel chaos. However, leaders in the south, like Bavarian Premier Markus Söder, are defiant, insisting their traditional holiday rhythm is part of their regional identity.</p>

          <h2>Strengthening Yen Dampens Luxury Sales for Cartier-Owner Richemont in Japan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 03:44:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods giant Richemont reported a 15% decline in sales in Japan, as a strengthening yen has curtailed the spending splurge by international tourists. This marks a sharp reversal from the previous year when a weaker yen fueled a 59% jump in revenues, particularly from Chinese shoppers. Despite the downturn in Japan, the owner of brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels posted a 6% overall revenue increase, beating analyst expectations. The company's high-end jewelry division continues to perform strongly, though its specialist watchmaker division saw sales decline, reflecting weakness in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has been fined and penalized with a two-point deduction in the World Test Championship standings for maintaining a slow over-rate during their recent victory against India. Match referee Richie Richardson determined that the team, led by captain Ben Stokes, was two overs short of the required target after time allowances were considered. As a result, players were fined 10% of their match fees. The penalty drops England from second to third place in the current championship cycle, highlighting a recurring issue for the team with slow play.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart International fell over 6% despite the company issuing a highly positive earnings forecast. The maker of the popular Labubu 'blind box' toys projected at least a 350% increase in profit for the first half of 2025. According to a Morningstar analyst, the negative stock reaction may reflect investors' belief that the company's explosive growth has peaked and could slow in the second half, prompting profit-taking. The company attributed its strong forecast to growing global brand recognition, diversified products, and an increasing share of overseas sales.</p>

          <p>Shares in Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML dropped 6.5% after the company stated it could not confirm growth for 2026, citing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The warning overshadowed a strong second-quarter performance where ASML beat revenue and profit expectations. The company, which holds a monopoly on the advanced EUV machines needed to make cutting-edge chips, also narrowed its 2025 sales growth forecast to 15%. While demand from AI customers remains strong, the cautious long-term outlook reflects the broader volatility affecting the global semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>
