          <h2>UK Faces Flash Flood Threat Amid Yellow Weather Warnings for Rain and Thunderstorms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 17:28:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a recent heatwave, the UK is experiencing unsettled weather with yellow alerts for rain and thunderstorms issued across the country. The Met Office warns of potential flash flooding, power cuts, and travel disruptions, as the parched ground is less able to absorb heavy rainfall. While a more severe amber warning for London did not result in the feared widespread flooding, localized impacts remain possible throughout the weekend and into Monday. These conditions follow a period of extreme heat that led to hosepipe bans in several regions.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her song "Roar" suspended above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet before stabilizing. Perry maintained her composure, quickly continued the performance, and flew back to the stage without further incident. After the song, she humorously commented on the scare, demonstrating professionalism in handling the unexpected equipment failure during her "The Lifetimes Tour."</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered an eventful third round at The Open, keeping his slim title hopes alive with a score of 66 to finish at eight under par. His day included a bizarre moment on the 11th hole where his swing unearthed a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey. However, he quickly recovered with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament from the supportive Portrush crowd. Despite the thrilling performance, he remains six shots behind leader Scottie Scheffler heading into the final day.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, building a four-shot lead after the third round at Royal Portrush. With a steady, bogey-free round of 67, he moved to 14 under par, positioning himself for his fourth major title. Scheffler has a perfect record of converting 54-hole leads into victories, creating an air of inevitability around his potential win. While other contenders like Matt Fitzpatrick and Rory McIlroy had moments of brilliance, none could consistently match Scheffler's unflappable and relentless performance on the challenging links course.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign and security policy towards closer cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trio known as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized that Europe must enhance its own defense capabilities, suggesting the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK could supplement US protection. This move signals a recognition that European nations must take greater responsibility for their collective security.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a move to Barcelona, with a deal in principle said to be reached for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford has been an outcast at Old Trafford since last December and was told to train separately after expressing a desire to leave. While Barcelona's interest is not new, the move is being questioned given Rashford's inconsistent form over the past few seasons. The transfer is seen as a low-risk opportunity for the Spanish club and a way for Manchester United to offload an unwanted player.</p>

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as "Operation Valkyrie," is being commemorated. Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the attempt involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters but ultimately failed, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While initially viewed as traitors, the plotters are now largely honored in Germany as heroes who dared to resist the Nazi regime. The article notes the historical debate surrounding their motives, which were complex and evolved over time, but their actions remain a powerful symbol of resistance.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, has sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock for approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows another significant divestment by the CEO earlier in the week. Nvidia's stock has surged dramatically due to high demand for its AI chips, making it the world's most valuable company and substantially increasing Huang's personal wealth.

          <p>Flanker Tom Curry delivered a powerful and aggressive performance that was instrumental in the British and Irish Lions' 27-19 first-Test victory against Australia. Responding to recent criticism about his form, Curry was described as a "man possessed," making immense contributions in his 58 minutes on the field, including a crucial tackle that set up an early penalty. Coach Andy Farrell praised Curry and fellow flanker Tadhg Beirne as "immense," highlighting their role as big-game players. Curry's warrior-like intensity set the physical tone for the Lions and was a key factor in their win.</p>

          <p>Major champions Henrik Stenson and Bryson DeChambeau have criticized the R&A's handling of slow play at The Open, calling the enforcement inconsistent. Both players were warned about their pace during the third round, a day after another golfer was controversially penalized. Stenson noted the irony of being pushed for being minutes behind schedule on Saturday when earlier rounds had run nearly an hour over their allotted time without issue. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing the current approach is unfair and that officials are afraid to expose the reality of play times.</p>

          <p>The article explores Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian movement of young activists who promote "chastity before marriage" to their peers in unconventional settings like the Jersey shore. These Gen Z members engage beachgoers in conversations about love and relationships, aiming to present chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity in a hyper-sexualized, social media-driven world. The piece examines the challenges they face in an increasingly secular society where premarital sex is widely accepted. It also delves into how their message taps into Gen Z's anxieties about modern dating and the search for authentic connection.</p>
