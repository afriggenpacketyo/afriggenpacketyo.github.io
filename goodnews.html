          <p>Democrats are intensifying scrutiny of President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures, particularly the $TRUMP meme coin, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Representative Maxine Waters and Senator Richard Blumenthal are leading the charge, demanding financial records and communications related to the coin and associated promotions, including a contest offering dinner with Trump and a White House tour to top holders. Blumenthal has characterized these ventures as a "pay-for-play scheme" and is calling for investigations into the Trump family's crypto activities, citing potential national security risks. With Republicans controlling Congress, Democrats aim to highlight potential corruption and appeal to voters concerned about Trump's economic policies.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors must adhere to federal laws, including proving that you owe the debt, that the amount is accurate, and that they have the legal right to collect it. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act allows you to request validation of the debt within 30 days of being contacted, halting collection efforts until the required information is provided. Paying anything on an old debt without verification can restart the statute of limitations in some states. Requesting debt validation protects your rights and credit, ensuring you're not paying inflated, outdated, or incorrect debts.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, saw a significant increase in April, reaching its highest level since October 2023. This 4.9% year-over-year jump and 2.7% month-over-month increase is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to concerns over potential price hikes from auto tariffs. Cox Automotive notes that this "spring bounce" extended throughout April, bucking historical trends. Jeremy Robb from Cox Automotive indicates that the strong price appreciation was anticipated in response to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>In his first interview since leaving office, former President Biden criticized President Trump's foreign policy, calling his actions toward Russia "modern-day appeasement." Biden also questioned Trump's comments about Greenland, Canada, and renaming the Gulf of Mexico, stating that Trump's rhetoric is not representative of American values. Biden defended the importance of NATO and expressed concern about the alliance potentially ending. Trump has faced criticism for his approach to international relations, including his remarks on acquiring Greenland and referring to Canada as the 51st state.</p>

          <p>Brendan Buck, a former aide to Republican House Speakers, argues that congressional Republicans' plan to extend the 2017 tax law to boost the economy is unlikely to succeed due to the negative impact of President Trump's tariffs. He contends that voters may not reward Republicans for preserving existing tax rates, and the effort could distract from addressing the tariff issue. Buck suggests that Republican leaders should pressure Trump to reconsider his trade policy to avoid economic damage and potential losses in upcoming elections. Without addressing tariffs, the tax bill may not provide the economic relief voters expect.</p>
