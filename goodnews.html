        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a move welcomed by Turkish government and opposition politicians alike. This decision could significantly alter the political landscape in Turkey, particularly for the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM). The dissolution raises questions about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan emphasized that merely laying down arms is insufficient, requiring the elimination of illegal structures and the development of an accountable organizational model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei issued a decree to curb immigration, drawing parallels to the immigration restrictions put in place by the Trump administration. The executive order tightens citizenship requirements, mandating immigrants spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure a passport. It also requires immigrants seeking permanent residency to demonstrate proof of income and a clean criminal record. The decree also facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter the country illegally or commit minor crimes, and charges foreigners for access to public healthcare and education.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is booming due to pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications like Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate but notes that potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry will have limited impact. Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system, contracting manufacturers in other countries to produce and ship products. The IMF projects medium-term growth at around 1.5%, reflecting a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

Japan faces a rice shortage due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased rice consumption at restaurants driven by a surge in foreign tourists.

The ISC expects a reduction in pupils applying for private schools due to the increased costs.

          <p>A manuscript long considered an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, housed at Harvard Law School, is now believed to be a genuine original from 1300. Two British academics discovered that the document, bought for $27.50 in 1946, is one of only seven originals from that date still in existence. The discovery was made after analyzing digitized images of the manuscript, revealing handwriting and dimensions consistent with other known 1300 originals. The document's value is estimated to be in the millions, with a similar version selling for $21.3 million in 2007.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have identified a manuscript in Harvard Law School's library, previously considered a copy, as one of only seven original Magna Carta documents dating from 1300. The document was purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II and had been largely overlooked for decades. Researchers authenticated the manuscript using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, confirming its text, dimensions, and handwriting matched other known originals. The discovery is considered significant, with its value potentially reaching millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article analyzes the formula for winning the Eurovision Song Contest, based on winners since 2000. Key elements include singing about personal liberation, often with a feminist twist, and primarily performing in English. The article suggests alluding to folk music without sending a pure folk song and advises against dramatic key changes, a once-essential element. It also emphasizes the importance of all-out staging, including fire and pyrotechnics, while cautioning against becoming a novelty act.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal suggests that China has the financial capacity to establish a market stabilization fund, citing its strong economy and large foreign exchange reserves. The fund aims to maintain capital market stability, protect small and medium-sized investors, and guard against systemic financial risks amid global economic instability. The article notes that similar mechanisms have been successfully used by major economies, including Hong Kong, to maintain market stability during crises. The fund would help reduce irrationally high market volatility.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog unveiled draft guidelines for a law governing smartphone software services of Google and Apple, aiming to promote competition from smaller firms. The law prohibits the companies from excluding app competitors from accessing their app stores and from using data obtained from their app stores or operating systems in their own products. It also prevents unfair treatment of software suppliers wishing to transition apps between stores. The law will be fully implemented in December, with public submissions invited through June 13.</p>
