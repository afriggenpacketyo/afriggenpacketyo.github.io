          <p>Families experiencing rare and severe vaccine injuries are turning to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, often referred to as vaccine court, for financial redress. This no-fault program, established in the 1980s, has paid out nearly $5 billion to around 12,000 Americans, providing compensation when a vaccine "more likely than not" caused an injury. While the court has consistently found no link between vaccines and autism, the current Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., seeks to expand the injury table. The article highlights the program's vital role for affected families despite criticisms of delays.</p>

          <p>China is heavily investing in AI and robotics, aiming to challenge the US's decades-long dominance in high-end chip development, with Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang acknowledging China is "nanoseconds behind." Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have unveiled new chips, with Huawei announcing a three-year plan to rival Nvidia. While some experts caution about data transparency, the article highlights China's vast talent pool and intense domestic competition as key strengths. This push is fueled by Beijing's desire for self-reliance and the ongoing tariffs war with the US.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's decision to significantly hike H-1B visa fees, India is intensifying efforts to attract skilled professionals back home, aiming to reverse a decades-long brain drain. While anecdotal evidence suggests some Indians are considering relocation due to a less hospitable US immigration environment, experts warn that large-scale reverse migration will be difficult. The article highlights initiatives like B2I, which assists non-resident Indians in returning, and the boom in Global Capability Centres in India. However, it also points to a lack of concerted government effort and existing pull factors from other countries as obstacles.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Mohamed Salah's Defensive Role Poses a "Little Problem" for Liverpool</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mohamed Salah's reduced defensive work has become a "little problem" for Liverpool, particularly against stronger teams, leading to tactical imbalances on the right flank. While manager Arne Slot may be allowing Salah to conserve energy for attacking, the article argues that players behind him are not providing adequate cover, creating defensive overloads. This issue, evident in a recent loss to Chelsea, contributes to Liverpool's perceived lack of control in games compared to last season. Despite concerns, the article expresses optimism that the team will improve as new player relationships develop and fitness levels peak.</p>

          <p>Historian Martin Powers discusses how visual evidence from imperial China, such as art depicting social relations and authority, can reveal widely understood political concepts. He argues that art "participates" in political debate, offering insights into how intergroup relations were imagined. Powers provides an example of a Han dynasty prime minister's story, widely depicted, illustrating the concept of limited jurisdiction. The article delves into how these historical visual narratives provide valuable context for understanding political ideas, including concepts like Montesquieu's "honor" in aristocracies, bridging ancient Chinese thought with modern Western understanding.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, having been the world's largest exporter for 16 years, should now aim to become the largest importer within the next five to ten years. This strategic shift, to be discussed in the upcoming 15th five-year plan, is crucial for accelerating China's transition to a consumption-driven economy and addressing structural imbalances. The article posits that moving from "made in China" to "consumed in China" would have profound geopolitical and economic implications, transforming the nation from a global powerhouse into a more balanced and domestically focused economic model.</p>
