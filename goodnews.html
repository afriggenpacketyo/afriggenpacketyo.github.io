          <p>The White House has applauded the Supreme Court's decision to uphold a Tennessee law that prohibits puberty blockers and other treatments for transgender minors. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called it a "huge victory for America's children," asserting the administration's strong belief that young children should not undergo chemical castration and mutilation. The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, was initiated by transgender minors and their families, with the Biden administration initially joining as a plaintiff. The 6-3 ruling stated that the law did not classify on any bases warranting heightened review, prompting praise from Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti. The article highlights the political and legal dimensions of transgender rights and the ongoing debate surrounding medical treatments for minors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effectively reducing plastic bag litter on coastlines. Analyzing data from over 45,000 beach cleanups, researchers found that local and state plastic bag policies decreased plastic bag waste by up to 47% between 2016 and 2023. Fee-based policies proved more effective than full or partial bans, highlighting the importance of policy design. California's experience, with an initial ban leading to a rise in thicker plastic bag waste, underscores the need for stricter laws and fewer loopholes. The article emphasizes the role of legislation in curbing plastic pollution and protecting marine life.</p>
