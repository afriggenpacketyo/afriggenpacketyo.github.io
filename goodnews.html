Following the announcement, Anglo American's London-listed shares surged by 8%, while Teck Resources' shares in Frankfurt jumped 22%.

She joins backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy as a declared candidate, with others like Lucy Powell also expected to run. Phillipson, positioning herself as a "proud working-class woman from the North East," emphasized her experience in combating the political threat posed by Reform UK. The contest has a tight three-day window for candidates to secure the necessary 80 MP nominations, a timeline criticized by some within the party as unfair.</p>

          <p>The long-running succession battle within the Murdoch media empire has concluded with an agreement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp and News Corp. The deal ensures the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal will continue after Rupert Murdoch's death. Under the terms, siblings Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch will cease to be beneficiaries of the main family trust, receiving approximately $1.1 billion each from the sale of their shares. This resolution ends all litigation over the trust and prevents James, who has disagreed with the company's editorial direction, from influencing the conglomerate's future.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has announced plans to launch its mass-market Mona series in overseas markets, including Europe, starting in 2026. The move is expected to intensify competition with both Chinese rivals and established global automakers, as the Mona M03 model was introduced in China with a starting price under $17,000. CEO He Xiaopeng also revealed that the company's international expansion is proceeding faster than anticipated and signaled that Xpeng is now open to acquiring other carmakers. The expansion comes as Chinese EV companies are making significant inroads into the European market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published for the first time, with specialist institutions like Moorfields Eye Hospital taking the top spots. The rankings assess trusts on seven criteria, including waiting times, A&E performance, and financial management, sorting them into four performance categories. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are intended to increase transparency and public choice, with top-performing trusts gaining more autonomy and underperforming ones receiving enhanced support. However, organizations like NHS Providers have raised concerns about whether the metrics used accurately reflect performance and could lead to unintended consequences.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu is set to issue a 4.4 billion yuan (US$618 million) dim sum bond to secure financing for its artificial intelligence initiatives. The move aims to leverage relatively low Chinese interest rates and provide operational flexibility, especially following a recent report of weak second-quarter earnings. This is Baidu's second such bond—denominated in yuan but issued outside mainland China—this year, tapping into growing investor demand for alternatives to US dollar assets. The issuance reflects a broader trend of companies utilizing the dim sum bond market for fundraising amid favorable conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

A recent HSBC survey of over 5,700 MNCs found that China remains the top target market for expanding global trade capabilities. Despite global economic shifts, China's vast market size, comprehensive industrial infrastructure, and innovation ecosystem continue to attract significant international investment.

This move follows a new government guideline encouraging the use of low-orbit satellites to expand high-speed data services, particularly in areas like emergency and maritime communications.
