          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in central Japan led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament, a women's second-tier Step Up tour event, due to safety concerns for players and spectators. Reina Maeda, the 19-year-old leading after the second round, was declared the winner, receiving approximately $19,000. This incident is part of a broader trend of increasing bear encounters in Japan, attributed to climate change affecting food sources and depopulation leading bears to venture into populated areas more frequently. The Japanese government has approved measures allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas in response to the rising number of attacks.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that the policy has contributed to increased poverty levels, but warned that removing the cap would be costly. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of its child poverty strategy, which is being developed by a taskforce led by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Politicians have been trying to boost manufacturing jobs in the U.S. economy, but what makes manufacturing so special? Economists at Planet Money explored whether manufacturing is special for workers, finding that it pays a premium, especially for those without a college education. Research indicates that workers who move from restaurants to manufacturing experience a 35% pay increase, higher than many other sectors. However, the manufacturing premium varies across subsectors, with high-end manufacturing like computers and transportation equipment offering higher premiums than apparel or furniture manufacturing; economists cite unionization, handling expensive machinery, and historical trends as possible reasons for the manufacturing premium.</p>

          <h2>China's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Decline Amid Clean Energy Push</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, even as energy demand and economic activity increased. According to a Carbon Brief report, this reduction is primarily due to China's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, which has outpaced electricity demand growth. This shift puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, including peaking emissions before 2030, and reflects its growing role as a major producer of clean energy technologies. However, the report cautions that emissions could rise again with faster economic growth and highlights the need to address other greenhouse gases like HFC-23.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Explore Delaying or Eliminating Menopause</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are exploring ways to delay or eliminate menopause, challenging the long-held assumption that it is an inevitable part of aging for women. Newer treatments aim to slow down ovarian aging, potentially reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and other conditions associated with menopause. While some experts are enthusiastic about the potential health benefits of extending ovarian function, others express concern that it may perpetuate the idea that women must remain young and fertile. This research raises questions about balancing medical concerns with the acceptance of aging and what women want from their later lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The emergence of a political divide between young men and young women has been widely discussed, with young men increasingly supporting right-wing parties. This divergence in values stems from economic shifts over the past half-century, particularly the decline of manufacturing and the rise of the cognitive economy. The traditional male role as producers and providers has diminished, leading to job insecurity and regressive gender norms. This crisis of masculinity provides an opportunity to redefine men's role in an inclusive way, focusing on both caretaking and production, as manufacturing is unlikely to make a resurgence.</p>

The surge in shipments comes as Apple seeks to mitigate the impact of tariffs on iPhones manufactured in China. While India has surpassed China in iPhone shipments to the U.S. in certain months, its manufacturing capacity is not expected to fully meet U.S. demand until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was rapidly carved approximately 2.1 million years ago when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow. Researchers analyzed ancient river sediments found inside the canyon's caves, which now lie high above the Snake River, to determine the canyon's age. The findings suggest that Hells Canyon is younger than the Grand Canyon and that its formation was linked to the draining of a large lake due to geologic changes and melting glaciers.</p>
