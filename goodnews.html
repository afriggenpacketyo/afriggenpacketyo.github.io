          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a nova, a temporary brightening caused by a dying star, near the Milky Way. Scholar Hu Guang reported the star's size, color, and brightness to Emperor Yongle, interpreting it as a heavenly endorsement of his reign. The rediscovered memorial confirms the event was a nova, resolving a debate among modern astronomers.
