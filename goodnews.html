          <p>Researchers are studying a group of individuals known as "SuperAgers," people aged 80 or older who possess the memory capabilities of those decades younger. A recent study from Northwestern University's SuperAging Program summarizes over two decades of findings on what makes their brains more resilient to the typical shrinkage and cognitive slowdown associated with aging. These insights could provide valuable clues in the fight against dementia and Alzheimer's disease, offering hope for healthier cognitive aging. The research aims to understand the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to this remarkable mental longevity.</p>

          <p>A discussion featuring cultural critics and producers explores the significant cognitive impact of smartphones, noting that their mere presence can diminish attention spans. The conversation highlights a growing trend among young adults, who feel overly attached to their devices, leading to a renewed interest in simpler "dumbphones" like the BlackBerry. Rather than relying solely on willpower, experts suggest managing phone relationships by creating intentional time away from screens and engaging in more meaningful real-world connections. This approach emphasizes structuring one's environment to reduce the constant pull of digital devices.</p>

          <p>After a period of dormancy, the market for space-related Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed signs of life, with several companies like Karman Holdings and Firefly Aerospace making successful debuts. This trend marks a shift from the previous reliance on SPAC mergers for space firms to go public. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the sector's alignment with national priorities and innovation makes it attractive to investors. However, they also caution that increased competition in the private launch market could create downward pressure on costs and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group jumped 13% to a record high following the release of a fiscal first-quarter profit that significantly exceeded expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp turnaround from a loss in the same period last year, marking its second consecutive profitable quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, its largest since 2021. The gains were attributed to positive results from both private investments and listed portfolio companies like Grab Holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship. This is the fourth such court order since a June Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the scope of nationwide injunctions. The policy sought to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. if their parents are not citizens or are in the country on a temporary basis. The judge ruled that the plaintiffs were "extremely likely" to win their argument that the order violates the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.</p>
