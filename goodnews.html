          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel is set to return to his late-night show following a suspension by Disney-owned ABC for comments made about the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension, which drew widespread criticism as a free speech issue, was reversed after what Disney called "thoughtful conversations" with the host. However, major affiliate groups like Sinclair and Nexstar have indicated they may not air the program's return, citing the remarks as inappropriate. The controversy ignited a national debate, with critics and celebrity supporters rallying behind Kimmel against what they viewed as censorship under political pressure.</p>

          <p>An official from China's top economic planning agency has stated that there is a window of opportunity to enhance the country's business environment and provide greater support for the private sector. Writing in the official Communist Party newspaper, the official called for stronger protection of property rights, improved government services, and regulated law enforcement concerning enterprises. This signals that Beijing may be preparing to roll out additional measures to stabilize market sentiment and boost investor confidence, even after recently passing a law aimed at ensuring equal treatment for non-state firms.

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has disrupted a massive, illicit telecommunications network in the New York area that had the capacity to threaten the city's cellular infrastructure and the UN General Assembly. Investigators seized over 100,000 SIM cards from multiple locations, revealing a system powerful enough to send 30 million texts per minute and potentially launch denial-of-service attacks. The investigation began after telephonic threats were made to senior U.S. officials. Early analysis suggests the network was used for encrypted communications between foreign governments and organized crime groups, including drug cartels.</p>

          <h2>Survey Data Suggests Los Angeles Residents Widely Support More Housing Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 06:03:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common perception of widespread "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) sentiment, a recent UCLA survey reveals that a clear majority of Los Angeles County residents support building more housing, even in their own neighborhoods. The survey found that 64% of respondents favor constructing apartments on streets currently dominated by single-family homes, and 59% want more apartments in their local area. The author argues that this data shows a strong public consensus for addressing the housing crisis and urges city leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, to embrace more ambitious pro-housing policies.</p>

          <p>An archaeological mission searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra has discovered evidence of a submerged ancient port near the Taposiris Magna Temple, west of Alexandria. Using advanced sonar technology, the team mapped a sunken shoreline and an inner harbor that would have been connected to the temple by a tunnel. The discovery of Ptolemaic-era anchors and pottery confirms the site was an active maritime zone over 2,000 years ago. Lead archaeologist Dr. Kathleen Martinez believes this finding supports her theory that Cleopatra's tomb is located at this temple complex, not in Alexandria.</p>

          <p>In a televised interview promoting her new book, Kamala Harris addressed her relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom, who she wrote did not return her call for support during her 2024 presidential campaign. Harris downplayed any friction, stating Newsom has a "great sense of humor." She also voiced strong support for a controversial California redistricting measure championed by Newsom, framing it as a necessary "fight fire with fire" strategy against Republican efforts in other states. Additionally, Harris commented on the public pressure that led to Jimmy Kimmel's reinstatement on ABC, hailing it as a victory for consumer power.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a bill that would mandate data centers to report their water usage, a move driven by concerns over the industry's significant consumption in the drought-prone West. Fueled by the AI boom, data centers use vast amounts of water for cooling their servers, and the new legislation would require facilities to disclose both projected and actual annual water use. The bill, which now awaits the governor's signature, aims to provide localities with the necessary data to plan for resource allocation amid growing strains on water supplies from both development and climate change.</p>
