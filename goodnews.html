        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emotionally safe parenting emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without dismissing them, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support. Emotionally safe parents also take responsibility for conflicts and create an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. Practicing this style includes doing inner work to understand personal triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by modeling healthy repair. It's about creating a safe place during emotional storms.</p>

          <p>A debate has erupted among Democratic policy experts over the "abundance agenda," a set of reforms aimed at easing building and infrastructure development. Supporters see it as a key to prosperity and liberal power, while critics decry it as a corporate-aligned scheme. The intensity of the argument suggests a deeper conflict over the nature and purpose of the Democratic Party, as the agenda challenges the power of activist groups. The agenda aims to address the dysfunction in government and restore bureaucratic confidence, but its challenge to established interest-group politics has sparked controversy.</p>
