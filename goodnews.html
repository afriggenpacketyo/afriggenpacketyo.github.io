          <p>The U.K. and U.S. have reached a trade agreement where the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff, with additional vehicles facing higher duties, while British steelmakers and the aluminum industry can export tariff-free. Despite the deal, a 10% baseline tariff remains on all other goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., suggesting this could be a minimum standard for future trade deals, though analysts note potential flexibility for narrower, bespoke deals with other nations. While the deal may support the broader UK-US relationship, it could also negatively impact U.S. economic growth due to the average U.S. tariff remaining in double digits, potentially slowing growth in the second half of the year. The limitation on car exports could hinder Jaguar Land Rover's market share, benefiting automakers like BMW that assemble vehicles in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Luxury labels, including Balenciaga and Versace, are strategically reducing steep discounts in China to rebuild an image of exclusivity and attract wealthy shoppers less affected by economic slowdown. Balenciaga, for instance, offered no discounts on Tmall during the first quarter of this year, a stark contrast to its 41 percent average discount in the previous year. This trend marks a shift from chasing short-term revenues to cultivating long-term brand affinity, with brands investing in relevance, desirability, and premium experiences to foster loyalty among consumers.</p>

          <p>International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, has finalized a $13 billion deal to purchase 32 new Boeing 787-10 aircraft, along with an option for 10 more, and a near $8 billion deal for 21 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft. This announcement followed the U.S. agreement to eliminate tariffs on Rolls-Royce jet engines, although the Boeing planes will use General Electric engines. IAG reported a 9.6% increase in first-quarter revenue to ‚Ç¨7 billion and an operating profit increase of ‚Ç¨130 million to ‚Ç¨198 million, indicating strong demand for air travel despite macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in premium cabins, while noting some softness in economy ticket sales by US holidaymakers.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, though Trump's 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have been scrapped. The deal does not include changes to the UK's digital services tax on US firms, but the UK and US have agreed to work on a digital trade deal. The agreement is not a free trade deal, and months of negotiations and legal paperwork will follow.</p>

          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity after winning an unexpected 8.8% in the federal election, nearly doubling its 2021 result, with opinion polls placing it almost on par with the Green Party. The party, focusing on affordable housing and diplomatic solutions to the Russia-Ukraine war, has nearly doubled its membership and is asserting its influence in parliament. The party leadership is advocating for a nationwide rent cap and criticizes Western countries for a "military tunnel vision," calling for diplomatic initiatives involving China, Brazil, and South Africa to resolve the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

The case stemmed from a police investigation that began after MacGill claimed he had been abducted and beaten in April 2021, leading to charges of taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.</p>

          <p>India is contemplating a trade deal with the U.S., potentially involving zero tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a shift from its protectionist stance. Recent U.S. tariffs on Indian exports have prompted India to rethink its trade approach, with the U.S. being India's largest trading partner. While experts suggest that such a deal could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and ensuring access to global markets, concerns remain about the impact on domestic manufacturing. Some experts believe that certain sectors like steel and pharmaceuticals may not be significantly affected, while others highlight potential challenges for generic Indian pharma companies and the need to balance economic benefits with domestic industry protection.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. While shipments to the U.S. plunged by over 21%, exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia as primary destinations, and notable growth in Indonesia and Thailand. This shift could be attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts, with analysts expecting trade data to gradually weaken in the coming months, as the number of container vessels from China to the U.S. has dropped dramatically.</p>
