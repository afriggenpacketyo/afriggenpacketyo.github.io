        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock value decreased by 6% following a record-setting rally earlier in the week. This reversal was prompted by an analyst report highlighting that a substantial portion of the company's future growth is tied to a single client, OpenAI, which is reportedly set to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years for cloud infrastructure. While Oracle had announced massive new contracts that swelled its performance obligation, the market's enthusiasm cooled upon realizing the significant customer concentration. This situation underscores investor concerns about the sustainability and diversification of the company's revenue streams in the competitive AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A debate is unfolding in Germany over the relevance of the traditional literary canon, which predominantly features authors like Goethe and other classic white male writers, in today's multicultural classrooms. With over 25% of the German population having an immigrant background, students and some educators are calling for a more diverse curriculum that includes contemporary authors and voices relevant to their lives. While education authorities are making some moves to include more modern texts, they face challenges related to cost and teacher training. The discussion highlights the tension between preserving cultural heritage and adapting education to better engage a new generation of students.</p>

The development comes amid a wave of transformation and expected consolidation within the media industry as companies grapple with the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming.

          <p>The NFL has announced it will not take further action against Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson for shoving a fan during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The incident occurred after the fan slapped the helmets of both Jackson and a teammate while they were celebrating a touchdown near the stands. The fan was ejected and subsequently banned from all NFL stadiums. Jackson later expressed regret for his actions, acknowledging he let his emotions get the better of him. The Ravens have addressed the matter internally and plan to implement additional security protocols to better protect players.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has launched a new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a palm-sized digital toy camera inspired by 1980s aesthetics, which has quickly sold out online. The camera, developed with Reto, is marketed as a functional fashion accessory and taps into Gen Z's growing appetite for vintage technology and blind box purchasing. This early sales success provides a potential bright spot for Kodak, a company that has recently faced significant financial struggles, including posting a net loss of $26 million in its latest quarterly report. The positive consumer response suggests a viable market in blending nostalgia with modern digital trends.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been meeting with several potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve. Recent meetings included former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard, as part of a process to identify a successor for when Powell's term expires in 2026. Alongside the search, Bessent is reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce its large bond portfolio and overall economic footprint. The selection process is occurring while the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for an interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Considers Bill to Ban 'Forever Chemicals' in Cookware Amid Debate</h2>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill that would ban PFAS, known as "forever chemicals," from being used in cookware, dental floss, and other consumer products. The proposal has created a contentious debate, pitting environmental advocates and actor Mark Ruffalo against the cookware industry and celebrity chefs like Rachael Ray and Thomas Keller. Opponents argue that the specific type of PFAS used in nonstick coatings, PTFE (Teflon), is inert and safe when used correctly, as affirmed by the FDA. However, proponents of the ban argue that these pans can release harmful particles and fumes, especially when scratched or overheated, posing a risk to public health.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including prominent activists and journalists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange for the releases, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. Authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko framed the release as a humanitarian gesture ahead of joint military exercises with Russia. While the move is a significant development for the freed individuals, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in Belarus following a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2020.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced details of the profit-sharing agreement tied to the recent U.S.-Japan tariff deal. Under the arrangement, Japan will invest $550 billion into U.S.-based manufacturing and infrastructure projects, and the two countries will split the resulting profits 50/50 until Japan's initial investment is fully recouped. After that point, the profit share will shift dramatically to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. Lutnick framed the deal as highly favorable for America, providing significant capital for domestic priorities like nuclear power plants while ultimately costing Japanese taxpayers nothing if the projects are successful.

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated battery factory in Georgia are being flown back to South Korea. The raid, part of the Trump administration's workplace enforcement agenda, was unusual for its scope and for targeting a major economic development project. The incident prompted diplomatic discussions between the U.S. and South Korea, with President Lee Jae Myung calling for improvements to the U.S. visa system. The workers were held for a week before being bused from a detention center to Atlanta for their flight home.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova's CEO, Scott Strazik, acknowledged that the company's onshore wind business is facing challenges, with orders remaining soft and a projected revenue decline of 10-15% for 2026. This outlook reflects the negative sentiment toward wind projects under the current administration, though Strazik expressed optimism about growth in the company's gas power and electrification segments. In other market news, Boeing's stock received a lift after Southwest Airlines increased its delivery expectations for the year. Boeing also reached a tentative agreement with striking workers at its defense business, signaling progress toward resolving the labor dispute. (not investment advice)</p>
