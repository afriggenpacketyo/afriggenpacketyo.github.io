          <p>Elon Musk has indicated he may be backing down from his public feud with Donald Trump after a series of exchanges on social media. This follows Trump's criticism of Musk's views on the tax and spending bill, as well as Musk raising Trump's connections to Jeffrey Epstein. Musk initially threatened to decommission his Dragon spacecraft in response to Trump's threat to cancel government contracts, but later stated he would not do so after receiving advice to "cool off." The White House has reportedly scheduled a call with Musk to mediate a resolution to the conflict, and Musk responded positively to Bill Ackman's call for peace between the two influential figures. Optimism surrounding this development could potentially foster a more stable environment for both the technology sector and government relations.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany stated in an interview with Fox News that migration is a contributing factor to the increase in antisemitism within Germany. Merz emphasized that the German government strongly opposes antisemitism and is actively working to reduce its prevalence. Data indicates a significant rise in antisemitic incidents in Germany, with 8,627 cases reported in 2024, a 77% increase from 2023. A substantial portion of these cases, 5,857, were classified as "antisemitism related to Israel," while 544 cases were attributed to right-wing extremist views. The German government aims to address this imported antisemitism through legal prosecution and comprehensive measures.</p>

          <p>The private equity sector is facing pressure as a previously anticipated boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, leading to concerns about its ability to generate top returns. Private equity firms are holding a large number of unsold companies, impacting investors' ability to realize returns. Despite these challenges, attendees at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin expressed resilience and highlighted growth opportunities in areas like European defense firms and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts suggest that private equity firms may have overpaid for companies during a period of low interest rates, and consolidation within the industry is expected to continue. The industry is adapting to changing market conditions with new trends such as continuation vehicles and NAV lending.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a five-year plan to enhance the country's infrastructure resilience to disasters, with an expected cost exceeding 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. This decision was prompted by prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture. The plan allocates funds for maintaining vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and enhancing disaster preparedness, including installing air conditioners in schools used as evacuation centers. This initiative aims to improve Japan's ability to withstand and recover from future disasters.</p>

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May as President Trump's tariffs fluctuated, impacting business uncertainty. Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a slowdown from the previous month's 177,000. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China in May reduced tariffs and boosted the stock market. However, companies like Pepsi, Goldman Sachs, and Target have warned of potential losses due to tariff-related uncertainty. Consumer spending, a key economic driver, could weaken if import costs increase, potentially leading to layoffs. Despite these concerns, the unemployment rate remains low, and inflation has cooled.</p>

          <p>A new program called Operation Guardian Angel, launched by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli, aims to force sanctuary cities to comply with federal immigration laws. The program seeks judicial warrants for illegal aliens with prior deportations who are arrested locally. This approach is intended to close loopholes that allow sanctuary cities to ignore ICE detainer warrants. By obtaining federal criminal warrants, local officials are compelled to hand over criminal illegal aliens to ICE. This initiative is a step toward enforcing immigration laws and removing criminal illegal aliens from sanctuary cities.</p>
