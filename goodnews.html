          <p>Taiwan‚Äôs main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, hoping a new party chair can lead it back to power. Before the leadership race, the KMT faces a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that could weaken its legislative majority. Analysts suggest that failing to contain the recall challenge could disrupt the KMT‚Äôs leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his readiness to step down, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July, hold internal voting in September, and install a new leader by October.</p>
