The government announced a ¬£1.5 billion investment in new defence factories, creating 1,800 jobs across the UK, supporting the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. The review acknowledges a "new era of threat" and the "immediate and pressing" danger posed by Russia, addressing deficiencies in the West's ability to produce weapons and munitions, and the UK's depleted stockpiles.

          <p>A palliative care physician, Dr. Sunita Puri, reflects on how facing mortality can bring clarity about how one truly wishes to live. She shares stories of patients who, facing death, reconcile the differences between the life they have and the one they longed for. The author contrasts the idea of clich√© bucket lists with the more complicated version of the ordinary that people often seek when reflecting on mortality. These wishes often involve mending relationships or achieving long-postponed personal goals.</p>

While World Skate also mandated a minimum age of 12 for other international tournaments, Japanese organizers kept recent domestic competitions open to future stars aged between 7 and 10. The International Olympic Committee started tightening age restrictions to protect child athletes after a doping scandal at the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing.</p>

The revised law introduces 24 tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, including programs for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues.
