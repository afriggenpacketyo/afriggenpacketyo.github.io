          <p>The Daily Mail and other newspapers report that the US and the UK have reached a new trade agreement aimed at saving the British car industry from American tariffs. The Financial Times notes this is the first US trade deal since the start of Trump's trade war, with the UK securing concessions on car and steel exports, though a 10% levy remains on most goods. The Daily Telegraph reports the deal allows the US to object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, a claim disputed by the government. The Times highlights that both Sir Keir Starmer and President Trump described the agreement as 'historic'.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration's Policies Cast Shadow Over European Wind Energy Sector</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:01:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article examines how the Trump administration's skepticism towards offshore wind power is impacting the industry, particularly in Europe. The indefinite halt to the Empire Wind project off Long Island has shocked companies like Welcon in Denmark, which was contracted to build turbine towers. While the European wind industry is counting on Europe to compensate for a pullback in the U.S., rising prices and uncertainty have led to project cancellations, such as Orsted's decision to halt the Hornsea 4 wind facility in Britain. Despite these challenges, offshore wind has seen success in Northern Europe, with costs falling significantly between 2015 and 2020, though they have since risen again.</p>

          <p>Japan's Cabinet has approved Princess Kako's visit to Brazil in June to celebrate the 130th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. According to Kyodo News, the princess will meet with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, attend a commemorative event, and engage with the Japanese community in Brazil. The visit will include stops in Brasilia, Sao Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro, highlighting the strong ties between Japan and Brazil, which hosts the largest Japanese diaspora outside of Japan.

          <p>CBS News reports that President Trump announced a trade deal with Britain, which could reduce the burden of his tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal, the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term, includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol. The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates.</p>

          <p>The South China Morning Post reports that producers in developed nations are seeking to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China imposed export restrictions on the metal. According to Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries, the industry is in 'absolute panic' due to the halt in raw material procurement from China. He notes that US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge to stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027. Tungsten is used in cutting tools, drill bits, machinery, ammunition, and clean energy applications.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that the U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaners from South Africa, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. The group is the first to be accepted after President Trump signed an executive order offering resettlement to Afrikaners facing racial discrimination. The South Africans will have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and be eligible for government benefits. President Trump, Elon Musk, and Marco Rubio have voiced concerns about the persecution Afrikaners face in South Africa.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the use of artificial intelligence to create a likeness of Christopher Pelkey, a victim of a 2021 road rage incident, for his victim impact statement. The avatar of Mr. Pelkey appeared on a screen, delivering a message of forgiveness to his killer, Gabriel Horcasitas, who received the maximum sentence. The use of A.I. in legal proceedings has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about manipulation and deception. The judge, however, praised the inclusion of the A.I., describing its message as genuine. This case represents uncharted territory for the use of A.I. in the courtroom.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Times features an interview with Argentine director and actor Iair Said, discussing his film, 'Most People Die On Sundays,' which explores themes of death, grief, and identity through a 'queer' lens. Said discusses how the film allowed him to explore emotions and manifest his physical presence, challenging typical portrayals of bodies in cinema. The film follows David, a character who returns to Buenos Aires from Italy after a family tragedy, grappling with his emotions and sexuality. Said wanted to portray realistic characters, including those who might not immediately evoke empathy.</p>
