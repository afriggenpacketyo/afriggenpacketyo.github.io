          <p>Brazilian police arrested two individuals in connection with an alleged plot to detonate a bomb at a free Lady Gaga concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew approximately 2 million fans. The police worked with the Justice Ministry to disrupt an attack allegedly planned by a group spreading hate speech against the LGBTQ community, aiming to radicalize and recruit teenagers for attacks using Molotov cocktails and improvised explosives. The concert, funded by the city to revitalize the economy, was a major event, expected to generate around $106 million. Lady Gaga's performance was also intended to promote her upcoming "Mayhem Ball" tour, showcasing songs from her latest album. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about extremism and security at large public gatherings.</p>

          <p>Retired NFL writer Peter King criticized Bill Belichick's recent public relations campaign, particularly his book tour, stating that it has been "embarrassing" for someone of Belichick's stature. King pointed to Belichick's appearance on CBS with a hole in his sweatshirt as an example of his poor presentation, contrasting it with paparazzi photos of Belichick in a tailored suit. Belichick responded by defending his girlfriend and accusing CBS of selectively editing the interview to create a "false narrative." CBS, however, stood by its interview, stating that there were no preconditions or limitations to the conversation.</p>

          <p>Active management is experiencing a resurgence in a market historically dominated by index funds, as evidenced by recent ETF trends where active equity ETFs saw inflows while index funds experienced outflows. Investing experts suggest this shift could reshape the ETF landscape, with a record number of new ETFs launching this year, rivaling the total number of index ETFs. While active ETFs still represent a smaller portion of total ETF market assets, they've captured a significant share of investor flows this year. Experts emphasize the importance of investors not overreacting to short-term market swings and staying invested for long-term gains, regardless of their preferred investment approach.

He also addressed criticisms of his handling of the economy, particularly his tariff policies, stating that the US is in a "transition period" and will ultimately have the "greatest economy" in its history.

          <p>The area in South Texas that houses Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company has been officially approved as the city of Starbase, following a vote by local residents.

Musk celebrated the decision, noting it is now a real city. However, the creation of a company town has drawn criticism, with concerns about Musk's control over the area and potential impacts on public access to local beaches and state parks.</p>
