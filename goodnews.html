          <p>A proposed bill in Congress would introduce federal work requirements for Medicaid recipients aged 19 to 64 who are enrolled through Affordable Care Act expansion. These individuals would need to work or participate in qualifying activities for 80 hours per month, with exemptions for those with dependent children or medical conditions. The House version of the bill estimates $344 billion in federal spending cuts over 10 years, while the Senate version includes stricter requirements for parents. Current law prohibits basing Medicaid eligibility on work requirements, though some states have implemented them through waivers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO leaders are set to release a joint statement on a collective defense spending hike, pushing member nations to increase their expenditure from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035.

Secretary General Mark Rutte has reassured allies of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, despite President Trump's past frustrations with defense contributions.

          <p>Relationships with in-laws can be complex, ranging from close and friendly to strained and distant, and expectations for these relationships are often unclear. Cultural and familial traditions significantly influence in-law dynamics, and interactions are largely shaped by one's partner's example. Conflict can arise due to varying expectations and a lack of clearly defined norms, particularly regarding involvement and traditions. Maintaining a cordial relationship with in-laws is often valuable for the sake of one's spouse or children, provided there is mutual respect.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump stated that there has been "great progress" in negotiations to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. This comes after recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, which Trump claims have set Iran's nuclear ambitions back by "decades." Despite a CNN report suggesting the strikes failed to destroy Iran's underground facilities, Trump labeled the reports as "fake news."

The article discusses examples such as Jerry Seinfeld and Elon Musk's father, highlighting problematic dynamics when significant power imbalances or questionable circumstances are involved. It suggests that when middle-aged individuals consistently date those under 25, it raises concerns about their maturity. However, the author concludes that relationships between consenting adults should not be subject to excessive scrutiny.</p>

The story follows Dr. Fejzo's path to finding a biological cause and a cure to pregnancy nausea.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, has declared victory in the New York City mayoral primary after Andrew Cuomo conceded. Mamdani, a state representative, had 43.5% of the vote after 93% of votes were counted in the primary‚Äôs first round. New York City uses a ranked-choice voting system, and as neither candidate is likely to reach 50%, the board of elections will now tally people‚Äôs second-choice candidates. Mamdani ran on a progressive platform, promising to freeze rent and make buses free citywide.</p>
