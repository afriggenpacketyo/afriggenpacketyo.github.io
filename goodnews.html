          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 10:13:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has made Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. For a $30,000 HELOC, monthly payments are now estimated to be between $285 and $362, depending on the repayment term, which is lower than costs seen earlier in the year. With market analysts widely expecting further rate cuts from the Fed before the end of the year, the cost of borrowing through a HELOC could become even cheaper. This financial tool allows homeowners to tap into their home's equity as a line of credit. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials reported no injuries and stated that evacuations were not necessary, though residents were advised to stay indoors due to potential air quality impacts.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos stated that while the current excitement around artificial intelligence resembles an "industrial bubble," the underlying technology is real and will ultimately provide "gigantic" benefits to society. Speaking at an event in Italy, Bezos noted that during such bubbles, both good and bad ideas receive funding as stock prices can become disconnected from business fundamentals. However, he compared it to past industrial bubbles, like biotech, where even after many companies failed, society benefited from the resulting innovations. He concluded that once the current AI hype settles, the positive impact of the winning technologies will be significant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's head coach, Thomas Tuchel, has chosen not to include Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham in his latest squad, despite the player's desire to be called up following shoulder surgery. The decision signals that Tuchel will not grant automatic selection based on reputation, instead prioritizing players who have performed well recently, such as in the 5-0 win against Serbia. Tuchel emphasized the need to build a team that is not solely reliant on one player, especially with the World Cup approaching. While acknowledging Bellingham's talent, the manager stated there are "no guarantees" for any player.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of locking in a fixed rate. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates offered primarily by online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs offering over 4% APY. The article explains that the current "inverted yield curve" economic phenomenon means short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare rates from online banks and consider a "laddering" strategy with multiple short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Electronic Shelf Labels Are Becoming More Common in U.S. Grocery Stores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 09:09:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major U.S. retailers like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods are increasingly replacing traditional paper price tags with electronic shelf labels. This technology allows stores to update prices across thousands of items in minutes using a mobile app, a task that previously took employees days to complete. While retailers claim the digital tags improve efficiency and can help lower prices on perishable goods to reduce waste, some lawmakers have raised concerns. Critics worry the technology could enable "dynamic pricing," where stores could surge prices on essential goods during periods of high demand, though retailers have denied any plans to do so.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team began their World Cup campaign with a decisive victory, bowling South Africa out for a mere 69 runs in Guwahati. Left-arm spinner Linsey Smith was the standout bowler, taking three wickets for just seven runs and dismantling South Africa's top order. The batting performance from the Proteas was poor, with only one player reaching double figures before they were all out in just over 20 overs. England's openers, Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont, then comfortably chased the target without losing a wicket, securing a crucial win.</p>

          <p>A free-floating rogue planet located about 630 light-years from Earth is experiencing a massive growth spurt, consuming surrounding gas and dust at an unprecedented rate. The planet, named Cha 1107-7626, is accreting material at a rate of six billion tonnes per second, the strongest ever recorded for a planetary-mass object. Researchers at the European Southern Observatory noted that this accretion rate is unstable, having increased eightfold in recent months. The discovery, which also revealed magnetic activity similar to that of stars, blurs the lines between planet and star formation and offers new insights into how these celestial objects evolve.</p>

          <p>In the industrial city of Monterrey, Mexico, a unique subculture known as "sonideros" keeps the spirit of Colombian cumbia music alive. These DJs, who emerged in the 1960s, are collectors of cumbia records and host parties in clubs and on the streets of migrant neighborhoods like the colonia Independencia. An accidental equipment malfunction at a party led to the creation of "cumbia rebajada," a slowed-down version of the music that became a local signature. Despite periods of intense violence when organized crime suppressed public gatherings, the cumbia scene has returned to the streets, representing a resilient part of the city's cultural identity.</p>

The report indicates Horner's strong desire to return to the sport following his departure from his long-held position at Red Bull Racing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After nearly 34 years, law enforcement officials in Austin, Texas, have announced a major breakthrough in the infamous 1991 yogurt shop murders. New analysis of ballistic and DNA evidence has identified Robert Eugene Brashers, a serial killer who died in 1999, as the likely sole perpetrator in the killing of four teenage girls. The case was solved after detectives re-submitted evidence to national databases with upgraded technology, linking it to other crimes committed by Brashers. The development brings long-awaited answers to the victims' families and is expected to fully exonerate two men who were wrongly convicted for the crime.</p>
