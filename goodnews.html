          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory over Sam Houston State. Manning threw for 309 yards and three touchdowns, adding two more scores on the ground, a stark contrast to his struggles in previous weeks. One of his rushing touchdowns was followed by a brief taunting incident with a defender, which Manning later admitted was "a little much" but attributed to built-up frustration. Head coach Steve Sarkisian noted that Manning plays best when he is "looser and free," which was evident in his performance.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted in all 26 states of Brazil against legislative measures that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for his role in a 2023 coup attempt following his election loss. The demonstrations were sparked by a fast-tracked bill in the lower house that could grant amnesty to those convicted in the uprising. Prominent artists and cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, have joined the protests to oppose the measures.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the deal for TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also mentioned Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as participants in the group acquiring the popular social media platform from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deal is being structured to address national security concerns, with plans for a U.S.-majority board and Oracle managing American user data. A source suggested Fox Corporation, rather than the Murdochs individually, could be the entity involved.</p>

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series win over Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, thanks to a decisive six-wicket victory in the final match. Chasing Ireland's target of 155, England's Jordan Cox anchored the innings with a crucial 55 runs, despite playing with a sore knee. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup on a slow pitch. The victory was sealed by Tom Banton with 17 balls to spare, concluding a successful series for the visiting team.</p>

          <p>London held a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, a move Mayor Sadiq Khan hopes will pave the way for a permanent pedestrian-only zone. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," is part of a plan to revitalize one of the world's busiest shopping districts by increasing footfall and creating space for outdoor events. While many pedestrians welcomed the change, the proposal faces opposition over concerns about accessibility, traffic congestion on side streets, and the impact on local residents and businesses. A previous attempt to pedestrianize the street was blocked in 2018.</p>

          <p>Remarkable footage shared by The Big Cat Project captures the intense ferocity of two Amur tigers, a brother and sister, as they were released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive predators snarling, swatting, and biting at their cage doors just before being set free, highlighting their raw power. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are native to eastern Russia and northeastern China. The species is threatened by poaching and habitat loss, with conservation efforts crucial for the survival of the estimated 500-600 remaining in the wild.</p>

The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition for "jostling."

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the paid status of the U.S. team could create pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage. For the first time, U.S. players will each receive $500,000 to participate, a move that contrasts with the European team, which continues to play for free. Donald speculates that if the American team underperforms, the New York audience, facing high ticket prices, might turn on them. He confirmed that his players unanimously rejected the idea of playing for money, emphasizing that their purpose and the tradition of the event are sufficient motivation.</p>

This "sensing-transmission-control integration" aims to eliminate manual oversight errors, such as missing bolts or forgotten tools.

Once known as "the stinking river," its restoration has allowed dozens of fish species and other wildlife to return.

Coyle, 69, previously worked with Skipper at Fresno State, where he ran a successful defense. With extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college and the NFL, Coyle is expected to contribute to a collaborative effort to improve a Bruins defense that has struggled significantly this season.</p>

          <p>Despite stocks reaching record highs, some Wall Street strategists believe the market could continue to climb, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom and easier financial conditions following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut. Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors argues that the S&P 500's high valuation is justified by the productivity gains from AI and strong corporate earnings prospects, noting "this isn't your grandfather's S&P 500." However, other analysts express caution, warning that a rate cut into a healthy economy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" that is not based on fundamentals and could end in a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. Telomeres naturally shrink with age, but persistent stress speeds up this decline, which can lead to various health problems. However, Epel notes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle." She recommends simple, sustainable practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily meditative breaks, prioritizing deep rest, and incorporating more Omega-3s into one's diet.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is considering reversing its long-held opposition to national identity cards, a policy they helped scrap in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and that a modern digital ID system, like one he observed in Estonia, could potentially increase citizens' freedom and access to services. The re-evaluation comes as the Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer is reportedly planning to introduce a digital ID scheme. While the leadership appears open to a debate, many veteran party members remain staunchly opposed, citing concerns over civil liberties, data security, and potential misuse by the state.</p>
