          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce a Relief Pitcher of the Year award for each league starting in 2026, recognizing the transformed and vital role of relief pitchers in modern baseball. This new honor aims to address the historical underrepresentation of relievers in major awards, as only one has won a Cy Young Award since 1992 and none have placed in the top three for MVP. The article discusses the fluctuating recognition of closers since the introduction of saves in 1969, noting the increasing value of setup relievers in today's game.</p>

Norrie expressed sympathy for Korda, acknowledging his talent and previous wins against him, while admitting to pre-match nerves despite his experience at Flushing Meadows.</p>

          <p>Several European postal carriers, including those from Germany, Spain, and France, are suspending some shipments under $800 to the U.S. due to the impending end of the "de minimis" trade exemption. This policy change, which allowed duty-free entry for low-value shipments, is causing logistical challenges as carriers' systems are not yet equipped for the new customs requirements. The suspension, expected to be temporary, will primarily impact smaller European businesses and American consumers making direct purchases, while larger retailers often use different shipping methods.</p>

          <p>Mexican drug lord Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, has pleaded guilty to drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in New York, marking a significant end to his notorious criminal career. The 77-year-old, who successfully evaded capture for five decades, was arrested last year following an alleged double-cross by the sons of his former ally, 'El Chapo' Guzmán. His guilty plea, which comes after prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty, is expected to result in a more lenient sentence for the reportedly ailing kingpin.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, aiming to validate corrective upgrades after three previous failures and restore confidence in the program. The mission includes testing the Super Heavy first stage and sending the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean, with planned in-space engine restarts and heat shield evaluations. Despite SpaceX's rapid development pace, experts express skepticism about the vehicle's readiness for NASA's planned 2027 moon landing, citing complex in-orbit refueling and propellant management challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A seemingly innocuous "SEQ" (sequence number) on a boarding pass can be the critical factor determining whether a passenger is involuntarily bumped from an overbooked flight, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. This number reflects the check-in order, and airlines often use it, along with fare paid or frequent flyer status, to decide who gets denied boarding. Travelers are advised to check in as early as possible, typically 24 hours before departure, to improve their chances of securing their seat and avoiding the stressful experience of being left behind.</p>

          <p>With Americans carrying record credit card debt, this article offers guidance on when and how to request payment pauses from credit card companies during temporary financial hardship. Lenders are more likely to approve requests for situations like job loss or medical emergencies if approached early, offering options such as deferrals, reduced minimum payments, or temporary interest rate cuts. If a request is denied, consumers can explore alternatives like debt management programs, balance transfer cards, debt forgiveness, or personal loans to regain control of their finances.
