          <p>The Trump administration asserts it has complied with a court order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. after his mistaken deportation to El Salvador, according to Justice Department attorneys. This filing comes in response to a federal case in Maryland, where a judge had mandated his return. Abrego Garcia was brought back to face criminal charges in Tennessee, following legal battles where the administration initially claimed his return was unfeasible. Abrego Garcia's lawyers maintain the case isn't over, seeking accountability for the government's actions and ensuring his case proceeds as if he had not been improperly deported, while the Justice Department intends to file a motion to dismiss the case. The author's tone has relative optimism due to the fact that someone was brought back to the US to face charges.</p>

          <p>While hummingbird feeders can supplement the diets of these tiny birds, they can also be deadly if not properly cleaned and maintained. Spoilage of sugar water can lead to microbial growth, causing infections like candida that can swell a hummingbird's tongue and lead to starvation. Wildlife rehabbers emphasize the importance of regular cleaning, recommending every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer. To support hummingbirds, experts suggest planting native wildflowers and contacting local wildlife rehabbers if an injured bird is found. The author's tone is relatively cautious due to the potential harm to animals.</p>

          <p>Students preparing for the fall 2025 semester face a challenging borrowing environment with high interest rates, making it crucial to secure a good student loan rate. While federal student loan rates have slightly decreased, private lenders offer a range of options with fixed rates starting at 3.29% and variable rates at 4.39%. Experts recommend starting with federal aid and comparing private lenders, looking for discounts, and considering a co-signer to obtain the best possible rate. Ultimately, a good student loan rate is the lowest achievable based on one's financial situation, ideally below the national average, but borrowers should also consider loan terms and protections.
