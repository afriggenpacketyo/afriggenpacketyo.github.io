        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, following no grand prize winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion drawing. This now stands as the sixth-largest jackpot in lottery history, carrying an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. The immense prize reflects a continued period without a top winner since May 31, driving ticket sales higher. With drawings held three times a week, the anticipation builds for players hoping to defy the 1 in 292.2 million odds to claim this life-changing sum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Thursday, influenced by an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite broader economic concerns. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed, though Nidec Corp shares plunged due to an accounting probe. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also gained, driven by increased household spending, while Hong Kong and mainland China indices saw declines. Global bond markets, including US Treasuries and Japanese bonds, remained in focus amid rising long-dated borrowing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner continued his dominant US Open title defense, sweeping past fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory to secure a spot in the semi-finals. Sinner, labeled an "artificial intelligence" player for his precise form, converted key break points while Musetti struggled to capitalize on his opportunities. This win extends Sinner's impressive streak to 26 consecutive matches won at hard-court Grand Slam tournaments. He is now set to face Felix Auger-Aliassime in the upcoming semi-final.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that ordinary Chinese citizens hold nuanced and flexible views regarding US rivalry, with nearly half favoring a shared leadership role rather than China creating a new world order. The findings, from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, suggest potential avenues to reduce US-China tensions. While optimistic about their nation's future and global standing, the Chinese public's preference for coexistence implies a less confrontational stance than often perceived in the West. Some survey results may be influenced by self-censorship.</p>

          <p>A US federal court judge overturned the Trump administration's $2 billion funding cuts to Harvard University, ruling that the government violated the Ivy League college's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that fighting antisemitism was not the administration's "true aim," suggesting the freeze was an "ideologically-motivated assault" on universities. While acknowledging Harvard's need to address antisemitism, the ruling blocked further funding stoppages and mandated payment of existing grants. The White House has vowed to appeal this "egregious decision."</p>
