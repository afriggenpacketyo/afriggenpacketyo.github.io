The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who joined in 2015, is reportedly in advanced talks with Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer. Son described the decision as the most difficult of his career, expressing pride in leaving the club as a "grown man" after arriving as a young player.

          <p>Cambodia's government has announced its intention to nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement that ended a recent border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodia's Deputy Prime Minister, Sun Chanthol, praised Trump's efforts in bringing peace to the region after the conflict had displaced over 300,000 people and resulted in at least 43 deaths. This follows previous Nobel nominations for Trump from officials in Israel and Pakistan for his diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Potato's Genetic Origins from Ancient Tomato Ancestor Hybrid</h2>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese scientists has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing an ancient link to a forerunner of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, researchers discovered that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago. This event involved a tomato ancestor cross-breeding with a non-tuberous, potato-like plant group. The findings, published in the journal Cell, indicate that this ancient hybridization was the key evolutionary step that led to the development of tubers, making the potato a staple food crop worldwide.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC defeated Mexican club Pachuca 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing in the tournament are minimal, as the two points earned are insufficient for a top spot in the MLS standings. The match saw both teams reduced to ten players, with LAFC's Nathan Ordaz and Pachuca's Jhon Cadiz receiving red cards after VAR reviews. Dennis Bouanga scored early for LAFC, but Pachuca equalized shortly after Ordaz's expulsion, leading to the decisive shootout.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained a lower court's order blocking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from conducting "roving patrols" in much of Southern California. The ruling affirms that agents cannot stop individuals based solely on factors like race or location without reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation. The court rejected the Trump administration's argument that the injunction would irreparably harm its enforcement efforts. This decision is seen as a significant victory for civil rights groups and local officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who celebrated the affirmation of constitutional protections.</p>

          <p>A truck accident caused a massive spill of hot dogs across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, leading to significant traffic delays during the morning commute. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to scrape against a concrete divider, tearing it open and scattering its contents. Cleanup crews, including the local fire department, were dispatched to clear the slippery sausages from the road. The fire chief noted the unusual hazard, remarking that he had not previously known how slippery hot dogs could be on a road surface.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese researchers suggests a connection between decadal-scale solar magnetic cycles and a pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China. The research, published in the Journal of Climate, posits that the "south drought and north flooding" precipitation pattern can be attributed to this solar influence. Understanding this link is crucial for climate prediction, as the position of the monsoon rain belt, which is influenced by these cycles, is a key determinant of drought and flood distribution across the country. This finding could improve long-term forecasting for flood seasons.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are reporting a significant uptick in stingray-related injuries, rising from an average of one per day to as many as 15. This increase is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, where more people are swimming. The area known as "ray bay," near the San Gabriel River mouth, is a particular hotspot due to warmer water from a nearby power plant. To avoid stings, officials advise beachgoers to shuffle their feet in the sand, and they recommend treating any stings by soaking the affected area in hot water.</p>

          <p>A new species of stick insect, measuring 15 inches long and weighing 1.6 ounces, has been discovered in an Australian rainforest, making it the country's heaviest known insect. Researchers named the massive insect Acrophylla alta and believe it is extremely elusive, likely living in the high canopies of remote, high-elevation rainforests. The discovery was made after researchers found a female laying eggs, which confirmed it was a new species. The find highlights the vast, undiscovered biodiversity in these habitats and raises concerns about losing species before they are even identified.</p>
