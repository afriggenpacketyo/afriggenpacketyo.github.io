          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed rare earth mining companies increased following the Trump administration's announcement of a price floor to combat market manipulation by China. These minerals are critical for technology and defense, and the U.S. government is actively working to build a domestic supply chain to reduce dependency on foreign sources. Investors are anticipating further government support for American miners, similar to a deal struck with MP Materials, which has caused stocks for companies like NioCorp and USA Rare Earth to rally. This strategic push reflects growing geopolitical tensions over control of essential resources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first year as Indonesia's president, Prabowo Subianto has engaged in extensive diplomatic activities, aiming to elevate the nation's international standing. He has actively participated in Middle East peace talks, offering troops for a Gaza peacekeeping force and backing a U.S.-led plan, while also finalizing a major economic partnership with the European Union. Critics describe his approach as 'FOMO diplomacy,' driven by a desire to attend global events without a clear long-term strategy, creating coordination challenges for his administration. Supporters, however, argue his active presence is vital for affirming Indonesia's role as a major democratic, Muslim-majority country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant health debate is underway regarding the coverage of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic for the millions of Americans on Medicaid who suffer from obesity. These medications have proven highly effective, but their high cost presents a major budgetary challenge for states, leading most to deny coverage. Proponents argue that the long-term health savings from treating obesity and related conditions would offset a substantial portion of the initial expense. They also contend that prices will fall over time and that denying access to this near-miracle treatment exacerbates health inequalities for low-income populations.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) currently present more affordable borrowing options compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of mid-October, average rates for 5-year home equity loans are around 8.15%, while the average HELOC rate is approximately 7.84%. These financial products allow homeowners to tap into their home's value for large expenses, and the interest may be tax-deductible if used for home improvements. With rates potentially declining later in the year, homeowners are advised to shop around for the best terms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates, which have recently fallen into the low-to-mid 6% range, are expected to be heavily influenced by inflation and labor market data for the remainder of 2025. Experts predict that if economic growth slows and inflation remains controlled, rates could ease further, potentially dipping below 6%. However, renewed economic strength could keep them elevated. Current forecasts from the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae project that the average 30-year rate will end the year around 6.4% to 6.5%, suggesting a period of relative stability for prospective homebuyers and refinancers.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia University business psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, mastering certain social skills is more crucial for career advancement than simply 'being yourself.' He identifies three essential abilities: being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone. These components of emotional intelligence make individuals more employable and effective in workplace dynamics. By actively soliciting constructive criticism and understanding others' perspectives, professionals can close the gap between their self-perception and their actual performance.</p>

The AI features, which are integrated into Apple's latest operating systems, are currently unavailable in mainland China due to regulatory restrictions. Reports suggest Apple may partner with a local company, such as Alibaba Cloud, to comply with Chinese regulations, similar to how it uses OpenAI's models internationally.

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer strongly advises long-term investors to avoid speculative 'meme' stocks like GameStop, describing the strategy as a dangerous game of musical chairs. He argues that such investments are based on the 'greater fool' theory—buying an overpriced asset hoping to sell it to someone else at a higher price—rather than on a company's fundamental strength. Cramer advocates for building wealth by buying and holding shares in best-of-breed companies with strong long-term prospects. While he supports dedicating a small portion of a portfolio to speculation, he insists it should be in fundamentally sound businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Activist hedge fund Jana Partners has taken a stake in medical device manufacturer Cooper Companies, causing the company's stock to jump 6% in premarket trading. Jana Partners intends to pressure Cooper to explore strategic options, including a potential merger of its contact-lens business with rival Bausch + Lomb, and to improve its capital allocation to boost shareholder returns. The move comes after Cooper cut its full-year revenue outlook due to weaker demand, and its stock has declined significantly this year.
