          <p>A representative for former President Joe Biden stated that he last had a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in 2014, which aligns with medical guidelines for men over 70. Current recommendations suggest men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of a PSA test with their doctor, while those 70 and older should generally not receive PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. The article explains that Biden's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer came after doctors discovered a nodule during a routine physical. The article also notes that PSA screenings are not perfect tests, with risks of false positives increasing with age.</p>

          <p>As talks between Iran and the United States progress, the possibility of Washington investing in Iran if sanctions are lifted presents a geopolitical challenge. Iran is cautious about direct economic involvement but may be open to enticing US investors, particularly if sanctions are completely lifted. The article suggests that phased US investment under regional mediation could be a possibility if a nuclear framework stabilizes, but any significant economic opening would require approval from the US Congress. The evolving dynamic between Chinese investment and potential reintegration into the Western financial system also shapes Iran's stance.</p>

          <p>Millions of shoppers could get up to ¬£70 each after a tribunal approved a settlement in a lawsuit against Mastercard which stemmed from historic fees levied on businesses by the card provider. The decision comes after a long-running legal case going back almost a decade, brought forward by a former financial ombudsman. Walter Merricks argued that shoppers were charged higher prices after fees were wrongly levied on transactions made over a 15-year period between 1992 and 2008. It is not necessary to have owned a Mastercard at any point to be eligible for compensation. Mastercard declined to comment on the court ruling.</p>
