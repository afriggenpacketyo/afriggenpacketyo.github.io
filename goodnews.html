        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions flared at the end of day three of the Test match between England and India at Lord's over alleged time-wasting tactics. England's Zak Crawley delayed the game to ensure he only faced one over before the close, prompting an angry reaction from India's captain, Shubman Gill. England's bowling coach, Tim Southee, dismissed the complaints, pointing to India's own delays earlier in the match, including Gill receiving a massage on the field. The incident added a dramatic finish to the day's play.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek's first Wimbledon title was a surprising achievement, even to herself, as she had previously been dominant on clay and hard courts but not grass. This analysis explores how the 24-year-old secured her sixth Grand Slam, attributing the win to a "new freshness" and improved patience following a difficult year. Key factors included overcoming a dip in form, working with a new coach to improve her serve, and shedding the pressure that had affected her past performances. Her victory marks a significant milestone, proving her versatility across all surfaces.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy positioned himself for a potential second Scottish Open title by shooting a four-under-par 66 in the third round, moving into a shared lead at 11 under. He is tied with American Chris Gotterup, two shots clear of the nearest competitors heading into the final day at the Renaissance Club. McIlroy stated he feels he is returning to his best form after a "lull" following his Masters victory earlier in the year. The impressive round continues his strong record at the course.</p>

          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon since 1936. They secured the championship with a straight-sets victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel.

Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are focusing on other positive economic drivers, such as deregulation and advancements in artificial intelligence. This market stability contrasts with the panic seen during previous tariff announcements, indicating a shift in investor sentiment and a focus on long-term corporate earnings potential.

They cite rising incidents of cyberbullying and access to harmful content as evidence that headteachers' discretion is not enough.
