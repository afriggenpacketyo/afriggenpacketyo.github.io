          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration is barred from cutting federal funding to 34 cities and counties due to their 'sanctuary' policies, which limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction, protecting jurisdictions like New York City and Los Angeles from having federal money withheld or conditioned. The judge characterized the administration's executive orders as an unconstitutional 'coercive threat' designed to force compliance with its mass deportation plan.</p>

          <p>Japan has announced a major infrastructure initiative for an economic zone spanning the Indian Ocean and Africa, a move that could create competition with China's established Belt and Road Initiative. The article suggests that rather than competing, which could lead to wasted resources and geopolitical friction, Japan and China should cooperate on these large-scale projects. It posits that working through multilateral development banks would be a more effective approach to ensure compatible standards and efficient use of capital for regional development.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat food waste, advisors to the Turkish president are developing new regulations that could affect the country's popular all-you-can-eat hotel buffets. With an estimated 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually in Turkey, the proposed measures specifically target large breakfast spreads, suggesting a shift to a system where guests choose their items rather than receiving a standard, oversized meal. This initiative aims to reduce waste but may face resistance from the tourism industry, which heavily promotes its all-inclusive offerings.</p>

          <p>Kira Chathli, a cricketer for London Spirit, has emerged as one of the top run-scorers in The Hundred women's competition, despite being initially unsold in the player draft. Signed as a late replacement for an injured Heather Knight, the 26-year-old has seized her opportunity with impressive performances. Her recent success is attributed to gaining a professional contract with Surrey and focusing on strength and conditioning, which has allowed her to hit the ball with more power and consistency.</p>

          <p>Lucy Guo, the 30-year-old co-founder of Scale AI who recently became the youngest self-made woman billionaire, adheres to a strict and demanding work schedule. Her daily routine includes waking at 5:30 a.m., attending two consecutive workout classes, and working long hours, often through lunch. Guo advocates for this intense work culture, especially for new entrepreneurs, arguing that a demanding schedule is essential for getting a startup off the ground and that work-life balance can still be achieved within such a framework.</p>

          <p>Paige Louise Williams, the founder of beauty brand P.Louise, has built a global company with a projected revenue of £138 million from a £20,000 loan she received from her grandmother ten years ago. Starting with a single salon in Greater Manchester and no formal business plan, she overcame early struggles by offering make-up classes and leveraging social media. The brand's explosive growth was significantly fueled by TikTok Shop, where she broke a UK sales record, demonstrating a remarkable entrepreneurial journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a hard-fought opening game of the high school football season, Mission Viejo edged out Santa Margarita with a 7-3 victory. The game was dominated by strong defensive play from both sides, with the only touchdown coming late in the third quarter from a 33-yard pass by Mission Viejo's quarterback, Luke Fahey. Santa Margarita's defense was particularly formidable, twice stopping Mission Viejo on the one-yard line, but their offense was unable to find the end zone, ultimately sealing the win for Mission Viejo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has expanded an injunction that blocks the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling by Judge William Orrick now extends protections to 34 jurisdictions, including major cities like Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles, that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders on the matter to be an unconstitutional "coercive threat" against local governments.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador despite a 2019 court order granting him protection, has been released from U.S. federal custody. The Trump administration acknowledged the deportation was an "administrative error" but subsequently detained him on criminal charges upon his return to the U.S. A judge has now ordered his release into home detention in Maryland, giving him the opportunity to mount a legal challenge against any further deportation attempts from Homeland Security.</p>
