          <p>In response to pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices, Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche, will begin selling its flu pill Xofluza directly to consumers. The new program offers the single-dose antiviral treatment for a $50 cash price, a 70% discount from its list price, through partnerships with pharmacies like Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs. This initiative is aimed at uninsured or underinsured patients ahead of the flu season, which was particularly severe last year. The move follows similar direct-to-consumer models adopted by other pharmaceutical companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump is advancing a $250 million, privately financed ballroom construction project at the White House, an effort seen as part of his focus on building a physical legacy. The project has been funded by corporate and individual donors, who were recently recognized at a White House dinner. In response, Democrats are introducing legislation to place restrictions on such projects, including banning donor names on White House structures and prohibiting construction during government shutdowns. The House Oversight Committee has also launched a preliminary probe into the ballroom's financing to scrutinize potential foreign influence or conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," with bestselling writer Harlan Coben. The novel centers on a talented female surgeon caught in a conspiracy, a character Witherspoon wanted to be defined by her skills rather than her sex appeal, contrasting with female roles in films she saw growing up. Drawing inspiration from her medical family background, the book explores themes of career setbacks and resilience. Witherspoon, who has championed female-centric stories through her production company Hello Sunshine, views this new venture as an exciting creative frontier.</p>

          <p>Apple and Formula 1 have finalized a five-year media rights agreement, valued at approximately $140 million per year, that will bring all F1 events exclusively to Apple TV in the United States starting in 2026. The deal, which replaces the current partnership with ESPN, will include all practice, qualifying, and race sessions as part of the standard Apple TV subscription without an additional fee. This move aligns with Apple's strategy of acquiring exclusive sports rights to control the user experience, building on the success of its Brad Pitt-starring F1 movie.</p>

          <p>Recent aggressive Russian air incursions into NATO airspace have been met with a firm and coordinated response from the alliance, which some officials believe may have backfired on Vladimir Putin. European leaders and security experts note a rare alignment between President Trump and NATO allies on pressuring Russia, fostering a sense of resolve that may counter Putin's attempts to divide them. This unity has led to enhanced defenses on NATO's eastern flank and blunt warnings from diplomats like Poland's Radosław Sikorski. While Trump's long-term commitment to the alliance remains uncertain, the current unified stance is seen as a crucial message of deterrence.</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has given Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK MP, one of its seats on the influential Public Accounts Committee, which scrutinizes government spending. Lowe, who was ousted from Reform UK after a dispute with party leadership, stated he was "delighted" and promised to ask "awkward questions" about how taxpayer money is used. The Conservative Party defended the move, stating Lowe shares their values on cutting waste and that they will work cross-party when it is in the national interest. This is not the first time the Tories have appointed non-party MPs to their committee seats.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, will reportedly run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously established an exploratory committee, his decision to run was apparently accelerated by the entry of a progressive candidate into the race. Pelosi, who is 85 and was first elected in 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term. If elected, Wiener, a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, would become the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress.</p>

          <h2>Bodybuilding Culture Shifts from "Dirty Bulking" to Health-Conscious "Lean Bulking"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:24:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The culture of bodybuilding is undergoing a significant shift, moving away from the traditional "dirty bulk" method of consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods to gain mass. Instead, many professional and amateur bodybuilders are embracing a "lean bulk" or "clean bulk," which involves a smaller, healthier caloric surplus to build muscle more slowly and sustainably. This trend is driven by a convergence of modern exercise science, which shows excessive calories are stored as fat, and broader cultural trends that value a chiseled, year-round physique and "clean" eating. However, experts caution that this approach can still involve extreme dieting and contribute to eating disorders.</p>

          <p>With gold and silver prices reaching new record highs, this article provides guidance for investors on how to approach these assets safely. It advises understanding the different risks associated with various investment types, such as physical bullion versus mining stocks. To manage risk and cost, investors are encouraged to consider splitting their funds between both metals and to adhere to the conventional wisdom of limiting total precious metal allocation to no more than 10% of their overall portfolio. The piece emphasizes that even in a booming market, these assets should primarily serve as diversifiers rather than the main drivers of portfolio growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:16:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deutsche Bank has named DuPont a short-term "catalyst buy," anticipating that the upcoming spinoff of its Qnity Electronics business on November 1 will unlock significant shareholder value. Analysts believe the company currently trades at a substantial discount to the sum of its parts. The CNBC Investing Club, which holds DuPont shares, plans to retain its shares in both the parent company and the new Qnity entity post-spinoff. They see Qnity as a particularly attractive long-term investment due to its stronger growth prospects tied to the semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>
