        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors like softer U.S. inflation, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which increased the appeal of alternative stores of value. Cumulative inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have exceeded $40 billion, with recent risk-off scenarios related to tariffs and deficits also boosting gains. The Senate has advanced legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and Coinbase has joined the S&P 500, signaling a significant milestone for the crypto industry.

          <p>A market analyst suggests that current distractions, such as presidential actions, tax bill battles, and tariff concerns, create buying opportunities for investors.

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota concluded with a decision to retain the "tush push" play, despite a proposal from the Green Bay Packers to ban it. The proposal failed to reach the required 75% majority, with the Philadelphia Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The play, also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward for short yardage. While the Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons for the ban, the NFL has stated that no injuries have been reported on the play.</p>

          <p>A Noise Within in Pasadena is staging a revival of "A Man of No Importance," an off-Broadway musical based on the 1994 film about a Dublin bus conductor with a passion for Oscar Wilde and amateur theatricals. The musical explores themes of loneliness, longing, and the transformative power of art. The production centers on Alfie Byrne, who decides to stage Wilde's "Salome" with his local church group, navigating societal objections and personal struggles. The musical celebrates the ability of art to uplift everyday people and enrich their lives.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would eliminate federal taxes on tip income, following calls from both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. If enacted, workers could deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided the tips are reported. While supporters claim it will provide relief to hardworking Americans, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate to middle-income workers, as many lower-income tipped workers already fall below the standard deduction threshold. The policy could also incentivize the introduction of tips in new occupations or income misclassification, according to experts.</p>
