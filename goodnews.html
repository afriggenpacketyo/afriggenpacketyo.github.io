          <p>Singapore's economy experienced stronger-than-expected growth in the third quarter, expanding by 2.9% year-on-year, surpassing economists' predictions of 1.9%. Despite this positive performance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has issued a warning that economic growth is projected to moderate in 2026, aligning with external developments and a normalization of activity in trade-related sectors. Manufacturing and construction sectors saw a slowdown, while global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to support the manufacturing sector. The central bank also forecasts core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising.</p>

          <p>China has commenced mass production of the world's first ultra-low noise, four-channel single-photon detector, a breakthrough poised to impact quantum communication and national defense. This 'photon catcher' device can detect individual photons, making it crucial for technologies like quantum radar, which could track stealth aircraft such as the F-22. The Quantum Information Engineering Technology Research Centre in Anhui province achieved this feat, highlighting China's advancements in cutting-edge quantum technologies. This development signifies a major step in China's strategic technological capabilities.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its mammoth Starship rocket on its 11th test flight, aiming to complete a journey halfway around the world and release mock satellites. The booster separated as planned, entering the Gulf of Mexico, while the spacecraft skimmed space before descending towards the Indian Ocean. This test flight, originating from Starbase in Texas, incorporated more maneuvering for the spacecraft, practicing for future landings. Elon Musk intends for Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, to transport humans to Mars, and NASA relies on it for lunar missions by the decade's end.</p>

Trump hailed the agreement as a "historic dawn in the Middle East" and declared the war in Gaza over, despite many unresolved issues. The summit followed the release of the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and Israel's freeing of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

          <p>Missouri has enacted a new law targeting distracted drivers, imposing a $150 fine for a first offense of using a handheld cellphone while driving. The legislation was championed by Adrienne Siddens, whose husband was killed by a distracted driver in 2019. The state's Department of Transportation is now leveraging anonymous smartphone and vehicle data to identify distracted driving hot spots, revealing that such incidents might be three times higher than previously reported. This data-driven approach aims to enhance educational programs and law enforcement visibility in high-risk areas, ultimately improving road safety.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to substantially increase the wages of state prisoners battling wildfires, raising their pay from approximately $1 an hour to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. This new law, Assembly Bill 247, takes effect immediately and allocates $10 million for the incarcerated firefighters' wages. These crews are vital to the state's wildfire suppression efforts, performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush. The legislation also builds on a 2020 law allowing nonviolent incarcerated firefighters to have their records expunged, addressing social justice concerns regarding their labor.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of President Trump's Gaza peace plan has advanced with the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased humanitarian aid. However, the path forward remains fraught with significant challenges and unresolved issues. Key sticking points include Hamas's refusal to disarm, Israel's demand for full demilitarization, and disagreements over Gaza's postwar governance, with both sides rejecting proposals. Reconstruction efforts are estimated to require at least $53 billion, and the long-term vision for an independent Palestinian state faces strong opposition from the current Israeli government, indicating complex negotiations ahead.</p>

          <p>The Scottish National Party (SNP) is demonstrating a significant political resurgence, challenging earlier predictions of deep trouble after a substantial loss in the general election. Under First Minister John Swinney, the party has regained stability, and support among rivals has fragmented, positioning the SNP to potentially secure a majority in Holyrood. While a majority would be a remarkable achievement, enabling their argument for another independence referendum, the UK government remains opposed. The article notes that the SNP's enduring support is rooted in Scotland's near 50/50 split on the constitutional question, allowing them to defy conventional political gravity.</p>
