          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio to bolster economic growth amid ongoing trade concerns with the U.S. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 basis points to 1.4% and reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. This action follows the announcement of upcoming trade talks between Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland, marking a potential turning point in the trade war.

          <p>President Trump adopted a surprisingly friendly tone toward Canada during a meeting with new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite months of previously critical rhetoric. Trump praised Canada and expressed affection for the country, a stark contrast to his earlier threats of absorbing Canada into the United States. Carney firmly asserted Canada's independence, stating that it is "not for sale." The meeting, while cordial, was laden with underlying tensions stemming from Trump's previous remarks and policies.

          <p>A plant in Shanxi, China, is being upgraded with French technology that will allow it to produce aluminum from low-grade ore previously considered unusable. The technology, developed by Yves Ocello of IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur in low-grade bauxite, making it suitable for the Bayer process. This innovation could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminum ore from Guinea and Australia, aligning with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry.
