          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a dominant figure in Washington, eclipsing the political influence once held by Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. His successful lobbying efforts, aligning with the Trump administration's strategic goals, have been pivotal in decisions like resuming sales of certain AI chips to China. This shift highlights the geopolitical importance of Nvidia's technology in the global AI race and its impact on U.S.-China trade dynamics. Huang's ascendancy underscores how central advanced semiconductors have become to national power and international relations.</p>

          <p>India's Vice President, Jagdeep Dhankhar, has resigned from his position effective immediately, citing the need to prioritize his health based on medical advice. The 74-year-old had served in the role, which is primarily ceremonial and parliamentary, since August 2022. In his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu, Dhankhar expressed gratitude for the support he received from the President and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Prime Minister Modi publicly wished Dhankhar good health following the announcement of his departure from the country's second-highest constitutional office.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Note Recent Days Have Been Fractionally Shorter Due to Earth's Faster Rotation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have observed that recent days, including July 22, are slightly shorter than the standard 24 hours by a few milliseconds. This phenomenon, while not uncommon, is caused by a combination of factors including the moon's gravitational pull, atmospheric winds, and movements in the planet's liquid core. While the long-term trend is for days to lengthen, a recent spate of faster spins has sparked public interest and discussion about a potential "negative leap second," an unprecedented adjustment. Experts emphasize that these minor variations are scientifically interesting but have no immediate impact on daily life.</p>

          <h2>Man with Deadly Brain Cancer Shows No Sign of Disease After Experimental Immunotherapy</h2>

          <p>A 40-year-old man diagnosed with glioblastoma, the most aggressive form of brain cancer, is now showing no signs of his tumor after receiving an experimental treatment. The patient, Ben Trotman, was the sole participant in a trial for the immunotherapy drug ipilimumab at a London hospital, which he received alongside standard radiation and chemotherapy. More than two years after his diagnosis, which typically carries a 15-month average survival, his scans remain clear. This remarkable outcome has provided hope and prompted a new, larger clinical trial for the same drug in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients.</p>

          <p>Events across the U.S. are marking the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a landmark civil rights law signed in 1990. In Cincinnati, celebrations include inclusive events like a rollerskating party where wheelchairs and skates share the rink, symbolizing the freedom and access the ADA champions. Activists reflect on the progress made since the law's passage, such as the installation of curb-cuts and greater public accessibility. However, the celebration is tempered by current concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid, which many in the disability community rely on for essential support, highlighting ongoing advocacy efforts.</p>

          <p>The UK government has signed a deal with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence to enhance productivity across public services. This statement of intent could see OpenAI's technology applied in sectors like education, defense, and the justice system, and may involve an information-sharing program with government data. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will also expand its London office. The partnership is a key component of the government's strategy to drive economic growth, though it has drawn criticism from some groups concerned about the ethical implications and unlicensed use of data.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is set to conduct a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with about half a dozen changes expected. Notably, former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly is anticipated to return to the front bench in a prominent role. The move is described by party sources as reflecting the next phase of policy renewal and underlining party unity under its new leadership. This shake-up occurs eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls, and follows a poor showing in recent local elections.</p>

          <p>A father is being hailed as a hero after saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The family was on a popular trail when the cougar bit the child, who was subsequently flown to a trauma center and has since been released. Witnesses heard the child's screams and saw the aftermath, praising the father's immediate and courageous actions which they believe saved the child's life. Park rangers located and dispatched the animal, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and have stated there is no longer a threat to the public.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced a plan to invest $50 billion in its U.S. operations by 2030, a move that comes amid tariff pressures from the Trump administration. A key part of this commitment is a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia to produce its portfolio of weight management drugs. This investment will also expand R&D and cell therapy manufacturing across several states, creating tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement follows similar pledges from other global pharma firms to increase their U.S. manufacturing presence as the industry awaits final details on potential sector-wide tariffs.

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil its first-ever sanctions regime aimed at disrupting the business model of people-smuggling gangs organizing small boat crossings in the English Channel. The measures will publicly name and target dozens of individuals and entities with asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions. Those targeted include gang leaders, boat suppliers, and middlemen facilitating payments through informal networks. This move is a central part of the Labour government's pledge to "smash" these criminal networks, though critics question whether targeting individuals can be a "game changer" for the overall issue.</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss is located above the Fen complex, the largest known deposit of rare earth elements in Europe. These metals are vital for modern technology and green energy, and the EU is desperate to secure a non-Chinese supply. The mining company, Rare Earths Norway, plans an "invisible mine" with a diagonal tunnel to extract the resources without displacing the village, aiming to begin full-scale operations by 2030. While residents have concerns about potential subsidence, the project holds the promise of economic revitalization for the former mining town and a strategic resource coup for Europe.</p>

          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, launched by the Alibaba-backed Chinese startup Moonshot AI, is rapidly gaining popularity. Experts are praising its cost-efficient design, which utilizes a "mixture-of-experts" (MOE) architecture. This approach divides the model into specialized sub-networks, significantly reducing computation costs and allowing for faster performance compared to models from larger competitors like OpenAI. Kimi K2's success highlights a potential strategic shift in AI development, demonstrating that powerful large language models can be created without the massive resource expenditure typically associated with leading AI firms.</p>
