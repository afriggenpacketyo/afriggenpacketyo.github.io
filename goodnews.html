          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its monthly government bond purchases at a slower pace beyond April of next year, scaling back debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. Simultaneously, the BOJ will maintain its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The central bank's decision comes after yields on long-term government bonds surged last month, driven by concerns about Japan's fiscal health. The BOJ's statement emphasized the uncertainty surrounding trade policies and their potential impact on overseas economic activity and prices. The central bank will conduct another interim assessment at its June 2026 monetary policy meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

The meeting signifies a continuation of improving ties between the two Asian nations, which had previously been strained due to historical issues related to wartime history and territory, with this year marking the 60th anniversary of the normalization of their diplomatic ties.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like U.S. Treasurys, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025. Experts attribute this shift to gold's freedom from government liabilities, making it an appealing option amid fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical instability. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys have faced sell-offs due to concerns about fiscal discipline. Gold's appeal is further bolstered by its status as a large, liquid, and apolitical market, as instability in the Middle East has also dented demand for U.S. safe havens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's directives leading to the cancellation of several National Institutes of Health (NIH) research grants were unlawful. The judge stated that the cancellations, which targeted studies involving LGBTQ+ issues, gender identity, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), violated federal law. The judge ordered the NIH to reinstate the terminated grants, with some estimates suggesting that up to $1.8 billion in research funding had been cut. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) expressed disagreement with the ruling and is considering legal options, including an appeal.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England (BoE) is widely anticipated to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% this week, as policymakers consider rising geopolitical risks, persistent inflation, and conflicting domestic economic data.

Rising oil prices and a stronger pound are complicating the inflation outlook, and domestic economic data remains uncertain.

Swifts were added to the UK's red list of birds most in need of conservation after a 66% decline between 1995 and 2022. Conservationists attribute the decline to changes in farming methods, fewer insects, and fewer nesting sites in tall buildings. The swift boxes provide a safe nesting environment for the birds, which spend almost their entire lives in flight.</p>

          <p>China has hinted that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned based on new images circulating on social media. State media referred to an ‚Äúera‚Äù when the Chinese navy would have three carriers, and satellite images showed 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes. Military commentator Song Zhongping suggested the new markings indicate the Fujian is preparing to be commissioned, potentially entering trial service before the end of the year.</p>
