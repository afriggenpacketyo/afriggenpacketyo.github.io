          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is pivoting the Japanese giant aggressively towards artificial intelligence, believing that artificial superintelligence (ASI) will emerge within a decade. This strategy involves substantial investments in AI-related firms like chip designer Arm and OpenAI, aiming to create an integrated AI ecosystem. Drawing parallels to his lucrative early investment in Alibaba, Son's long-standing vision for AI, which predates the current hype, is now the core focus of SoftBank's future, despite past investment setbacks with the Vision Fund.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's seas are experiencing their warmest start to the year on record, a trend linked to climate change that is causing significant shifts in marine ecosystems. This warming has led to the arrival of extraordinary species not typically found in UK waters, such as bluefin tuna, octopus, and mauve stinger jellyfish. While these new arrivals are notable, the rising temperatures are also creating challenging conditions for native, cold-adapted species like cod. Scientists warn that marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, posing long-term challenges for both wildlife and local fishing communities.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, issued a joint statement emphasizing that a path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. This declaration comes ahead of a planned one-on-one meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. While welcoming U.S. efforts to end the conflict, the leaders reiterated their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and stated that any negotiations must start from the current line of contact. The White House has indicated it remains open to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy joining the summit, but the meeting is currently set as bilateral.</p>

Rose birdied four of his final five holes in regulation to force the playoff and ultimately clinched the victory with another birdie on the third extra hole. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who held a share of the lead late in the final round but bogeyed the 17th hole, finishing one stroke behind.

          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives, addressing a surplus of graduates. With thousands more graduates than available vacancies, the plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal openings. Nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a source of hope for students struggling to find jobs. However, employer representatives raised concerns about how these new positions will be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason victory against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance made a strong case in the competition for the backup role. Lance demonstrated his dual-threat ability, rushing for 48 yards and a touchdown while completing seven passes for 55 yards. His performance contrasted with that of veteran Taylor Heinicke, who appeared rusty in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the emergence of defensive end Caleb Murphy, who recorded two sacks, strengthening his bid for a spot on the 53-man roster.</p>

          <p>Naval forces from six allied nations, including the U.S., U.K., and Japan, are conducting a large-scale military exercise in the North Philippine Sea. The powerful show of force is led by three aircraft carriers sailing together: the HMS Prince of Wales, the USS George Washington, and the JS Kaga. The nine-day operation involves over a dozen ships and a large number of fighter jets, focusing on training for cross-deck operations and anti-submarine warfare. This multilateral drill demonstrates strong allied cooperation and presence in the strategically important Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, highlights the often-underestimated impact of World War II on the nation's development. In an interview, Mitter explains that the war, particularly Japan's invasion, was a pivotal event that shattered China's pre-war infrastructure and communications, forcing the country to rebuild almost from scratch. This historical context is crucial for understanding China's subsequent political and societal trajectory. Mitter suggests that reflecting on this history, 80 years later, shows that China's current interests are best served by maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Blocks Commercial Fishing in Pacific Marine Monument, Overturning Trump Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Hawaii has ruled that commercial fishing is illegal within the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, overturning a Trump administration policy that sought to allow it. The decision blocks a letter from the National Marine Fisheries Service that had reversed Obama-era protections for the monument. Environmental and Native Hawaiian groups filed the lawsuit, arguing the administration bypassed the required public process for changing the rules. The ruling is being hailed as a major victory for the protection of the monument's unique and vulnerable marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's revamped team, featuring four new summer signings in the starting lineup, displayed both promising attacking flair and concerning defensive vulnerabilities in their Community Shield loss to Crystal Palace. Newcomers Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong both scored on their competitive debuts in the 2-2 draw, which was decided on penalties. However, the team twice surrendered leads and looked susceptible in defense, highlighting areas manager Arne Slot needs to address. Record signing Florian Wirtz was a standout performer, showcasing his creative influence from an attacking midfield role.</p>
