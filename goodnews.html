          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping engaged in a phone conversation primarily focused on trade, leading to a positive conclusion for both countries. Trump mentioned that negotiating teams from the U.S. and China would soon meet to address complexities related to rare earth products, magnets, and other issues. During the call, Xi extended an invitation for Trump and the First Lady to visit China, which Trump accepted, while also reciprocating with an invitation for Xi to visit the U.S. The discussion occurred amidst ongoing trade tensions, with both sides expressing concerns about trade restrictions and tariffs, but Trump expressed confidence that any complexities regarding the agreement were straightened out.

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed over 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders who were previously barred from collecting full benefits due to the Windfall Elimination Provision and Government Pension Offset. The Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law in January 2025, ended these provisions, enabling millions to receive retroactive payments dating back to January 2024. The agency started issuing payments in February, and most eligible parties should have seen payment increases starting in April, although some complicated cases may take longer to process. The SSA expects all beneficiary records to be updated by November 2025, and those eligible who have not received payment can check their account online or call the agency to ensure they have the correct information on file.

The discussion followed posts on social media by Trump praising the Chinese leader but also acknowledging the difficulty in reaching a deal with him.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, ruling in favor of Catholic Charities, which was denied an exemption from paying unemployment taxes. The Court found that Wisconsin law violated the rule that the government cannot prefer one religious denomination over another. The ruling avoids a broader fight over when businesses with a religious identity can ignore the law, focusing on the narrow distinction between religious groups that proselytize or serve only co-religionists and those that do not. The decision is unlikely to significantly undermine workplace protections, but future courts may need to determine whether other laws that treat organizations differently do so because of theological differences.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a decision to discontinue the powertrain amid tightening fuel economy regulations and a shift toward electric vehicles. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi was a mistake and said the return is part of a new product turnaround plan. The move reflects a broader trend of automakers adjusting plans as EV adoption has been slower than expected, with the Trump administration seeking to unwind initiatives pushing the industry away from internal combustion engines. Kuniskis expects Hemi to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 pickup truck sales, offering it as an option alongside the more efficient Hurricane engine.</p>

          <p>Private school pupil numbers in England have decreased by 11,000 following the government's removal of a VAT exemption for private schools. The figures indicate a 1.9% drop in pupils attending private schools, with overall pupil numbers in England falling slightly. The Independent Schools Council suggested that VAT on fees was putting pressure on parents and was the reason behind the drop. The government had predicted that around 3,000 private school pupils would need to be absorbed into the state system this academic year, but the census data does not give clear reasons as to why pupils have left private school.</p>
