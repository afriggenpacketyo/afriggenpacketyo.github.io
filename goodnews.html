          <p>President Trump emphasized the importance of passing the GOP tax megabill before the Fourth of July holiday, urging Republican friends in the Senate and House to expedite its progress. Trump also addressed concerns about potential cuts to Medicaid and other entitlement programs, dismissing arguments from Democrats as misinformation. He asserted that there would be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid, claiming they would be safeguarded from Democratic incompetence. The administration aims to finalize the legislation swiftly despite ongoing debates about its impact on various social programs. Optimism surrounds the potential economic benefits highlighted by the administration.</p>

          <p>The White House released a new official portrait of President Trump, featuring deeper shadowing and a black backdrop, differing from the earlier portrait released in January, which had brighter illumination and an American flag backdrop. Both photographs were taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok. A White House official stated that the updated portrait will replace existing official photographs in federal buildings and offices, and has already been updated on the White House website. The reason for the update was not explicitly stated, but the new portrait captures a different visual representation of the President.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering information about songs parents sing to their babies, inspired by a Yale University study that found singing to infants improves their moods and overall well-being. The study, which surveyed 110 parents and their babies, indicated that infants who are sung to more often are generally happier throughout the day. Samuel Mehr, an associate professor at the Yale University Child Study Center, emphasized that any song, not just lullabies, can be beneficial. NPR encourages parents to share their songs and experiences, with submissions potentially featured on Morning Edition.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg discusses the Broadway play "John Proctor Is the Villain," which is set in a high school during the MeToo movement and has been causing women to leave performances in tears. The play revolves around an honors English class studying "The Crucible" and explores themes of feminism, accusation, and the complexities of teenage emotions. The playwright, Kimberly Belflower, was inspired by the MeToo movement and its impact on her own adolescence. The play's power lies in its ability to transport viewers back to a time when MeToo felt full of possibility before the backlash.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service is planning to hire over 100 people after nearly 600 employees were laid off or retired due to government-wide budget cuts earlier in the year. The agency aims to restore its workforce to maintain its ability to provide accurate and timely weather forecasts and warnings. The hiring initiative reflects an effort to address the impact of previous staff reductions on the agency's operations. The move is expected to improve the NWS's capacity to serve the public and support critical weather-related services.</p>

          <p>Despite a strong month for stocks in May, ETF flows suggest lingering skepticism among investors about the strength of the U.S. equities market. Inflows into equity ETFs have fallen by more than half since the market recovered from April losses, with investors primarily seeking refuge in ultra-short duration assets like Treasury bond ETFs. This shift indicates a cautious stance on stocks, potentially reflecting a "reset year" pattern in the bull market cycle. While retail investors with a long-term focus continue to buy the U.S. market, the top ETF categories in flows since the April low are crypto, short duration bonds, and value stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following recent solar storms, the northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S., including Alaska, Washington, Montana, and other northern states. The sun's current active phase in its 11-year cycle makes these light displays more common and widespread. Experts recommend finding a quiet, dark area away from city lights to view the auroras, and checking weather forecasts for cloud cover. Auroras, also known as the northern and southern lights, occur when charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman's longline. The men, who avoided prison time but faced restitution and felony convictions, spotted the line off Jupiter Inlet in August 2020 and believed it was illegal. Federal prosecutors charged them with theft, arguing the line belonged to a licensed fisherman. The pardons erase the convictions, allowing the men to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S.</p>

The device gently pulls the sternum forward, reducing the dent in his chest from 1.9 cm to 0.05 cm over 14 months. Scotland is the first part of the UK to recommend the device as a less invasive alternative to surgery for children with the condition. The vacuum bell has improved Ryan's physical and emotional well-being, offering a non-surgical solution for a condition that can negatively impact self-esteem.</p>
