          <p>An Ohio-based tiny living enthusiast, Levi Kelly, successfully built a 19.4-by-4-foot house in his yard for approximately $5,000, utilizing many materials he already owned. The month-long project resulted in a fully functional, off-grid capable home equipped with solar power, heating and air conditioning, a compact kitchen, and a toilet. Despite its closet-sized dimensions, the structure proved durable enough to withstand a snowstorm. Kelly, who documents unique Airbnbs, views the project as a testament to creative space efficiency, though he does not plan to live in it full-time.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $750 million, making it the tenth-largest prize in the lottery's history, after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday's drawing. The winning numbers were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, with a red Powerball of 18. While there was no grand prize winner, tickets sold in Maine and Massachusetts each won $1 million for matching the five white balls. Another ticket in South Dakota won $2 million by matching the five white balls and including the Power Play option, which doubled the prize. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's independence day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant speech, vowing that the nation would continue fighting for its freedom until its calls for peace are heard. The address coincided with reports of a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian nuclear power plant, which Moscow confirmed caused a fire but no radiation leak. Meanwhile, several allied nations announced significant new aid packages, including over $1 billion in military equipment from Canada and substantial air defense systems from Norway. The day also saw a prisoner swap, with 146 soldiers exchanged between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

          <p>Parts of Atlantic Canada are expected to receive beneficial rainfall early this week, which will help ease severe drought conditions and high wildfire risks in the region. A large low-pressure system is set to bring a soaking rain, with some areas in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland potentially receiving over 50mm. The precipitation is desperately needed, as many areas have experienced an unusually dry August, with St. John's, for example, having gone 21 days without measurable rain. While the rain is not from a tropical system, it is a welcome development for communities that have been battling parched conditions.</p>

          <p>Chabely Rodriguez, a 30-year-old certified anesthesiologist assistant (CAA), earns over $300,000 a year by working in contract positions, a career path she pursued without attending medical school. After obtaining a master's degree in anesthesiology, she was able to get her CAA credentials. By strategically managing her finances, she paid off nearly $124,000 in student loans and has accumulated $500,000 in investments. Rodriguez has shifted her focus from aggressive overtime to maintaining a 40-hour workweek to avoid burnout, prioritizing travel and a sustainable financial future over early retirement at any cost.</p>

Gebbia, who recently shifted his political alignment from Democrat to supporting Trump, stated his goal is to make online government services "beautiful" and user-friendly, similar to the Apple App Store.

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become residents of New York's Central Park, drawing the attention of local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. This is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding their territory eastward and adapting to urban life across the United States, with an estimated 20 living in New York City. Experts from groups like Gotham Coyote explain that the animals are highly adaptable and pose little danger to humans if given space and not fed. City officials have shifted from a capture-and-remove policy to one promoting coexistence, educating the public to ensure both people and wildlife can safely share park spaces.</p>

          <p>Despite initial investor disappointment with trial data, some analysts believe Eli Lilly's daily obesity pill, orforglipron, remains a strong potential competitor to Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide. While Lilly's pill showed slightly less weight loss, it has key advantages as a small-molecule drug: it is easier to manufacture at scale and does not require the dietary restrictions associated with Novo's peptide-based pill. These factors could allow for global availability and potentially lower pricing, a significant edge in a market where many health plans do not cover obesity treatments. Goldman Sachs analysts forecast Lilly's pill could capture a majority share of the oral weight loss drug market by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new meme is trending on TikTok and in real-life contests, centered on the "performative male," a man who adopts an alternative, intellectual aesthetic to appeal to progressive women. This archetype is characterized by interests like feminist literature, indie music, tote bags, and matcha. While often lighthearted, the trend also touches on a deeper skepticism about whether these traits are genuine or a deceptive performance to mask more toxic behaviors. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural conversation about modern masculinity, authenticity in dating, and the suspicion that can arise when men adopt traits and aesthetics traditionally coded as feminine or queer.</p>

          <p>A Tesla owner shared an honest review of his first year with the electric vehicle, noting that while his savings on fuel were less than expected, the real financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs. In a TikTok video, he reported spending $1,432 on charging while saving an estimated $334 on gas. However, he contrasted this with the tens of thousands he spent on repairs for his previous car, having only spent $600 on two new tires for the Tesla after 15,000 miles. He concluded that the savings from avoiding frequent repairs will increase significantly the more he drives the car.</p>

          <p>Despite being offered by 86% of workplace retirement plans, only 18% of eligible participants made Roth 401(k) contributions in 2024, according to a Vanguard analysis.

Experts suggest the low adoption rate is partly because plans often default employees into traditional pre-tax contributions. Unlike pre-tax funds, Roth 401(k)s do not have required minimum distributions for the original account owner, which can be a major advantage for managing retirement income and tax burdens.

Compared to other popular sports, it has a very low risk of catastrophic injury or concussion, making it a safe activity to continue throughout one's life.

Drawing from personal experience, she describes reading aloud not just as a way to instill a love of literature, but as a method for guiding a child's understanding of the world. The act of sharing a book creates a unique bond and provides parents with a window into their child's developing mind. From poetry in the maternity ward to board books at home, reading aloud becomes a tool for teaching language, concepts, and connection.</p>
