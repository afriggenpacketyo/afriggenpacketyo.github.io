          <h2>Homeland Security Secretary Signals Potential Changes to TSA's Carry-On Liquid Restrictions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:34:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its rules regarding liquids in carry-on luggage. Following the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during security checks, Noem stated she is questioning all current TSA procedures. The potential revision could change the long-standing 3.4-ounce limit, a rule implemented after a 2006 liquid explosives plot. While no specific details or timeline were provided, this review is part of a broader effort to streamline airport security processes.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists known as the "Bad News Babes." Unlike the partisan men's baseball game, this event fosters camaraderie while supporting a significant cause, the Young Survival Coalition, which aids young adults with breast cancer. The game was co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a breast cancer survivor, and has raised nearly $5 million for the charity over 17 years, offering a rare moment of unity in Washington.</p>

          <h2>Summer Movie Season Features Horror Sequel, Neo-Western, and International Dramas</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:29:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This month's film releases offer a diverse slate for moviegoers, including a new installment in a classic horror franchise and an ambitious neo-western. The sequel to "I Know What You Did Last Summer" attempts a self-aware tone but delivers mixed results, while Ari Aster's "Eddington," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, is a politically charged drama set during the 2020 pandemic. Other notable releases reviewed include "Tardes de soledad," a controversial documentary on bullfighting, and two LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," each exploring unique and sensitive relationships.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old and drilled from deep within Antarctica, is now being analyzed by scientists at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge. By carefully melting the ice, researchers will examine trapped ancient dust, volcanic ash, and microscopic algae to uncover new information about Earth's climate history. This unprecedented data could revolutionize our understanding of climate change, particularly a mysterious period known as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. The findings aim to provide crucial insights into how our planet responds to high levels of greenhouse gases.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June, Though Still Above Bank of Japan's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 20:16:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, maintaining pressure on the central bank to consider raising interest rates. The data comes as Japan faces economic growth concerns fueled by potential U.S. tariffs and a decline in first-quarter GDP. Analysts, however, suggest a rate hike is unlikely until early 2026, as inflation expectations remain below the target threshold. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New regulations coming into force in the UK next July will require "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and facing unexpected late fees. While some shoppers may be denied credit as a result, the rules will provide consumers with greater protections, including the right to complain to the Financial Ombudsman. This brings the largely unregulated BNPL sector more in line with other forms of credit.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. A memo from the president's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, stated that a comprehensive examination revealed the benign condition and ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. The doctor affirmed that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent" overall health. The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photos showing the president with swollen ankles and bruised hands, which the memo attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including further isolating banks from the SWIFT system and targeting its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers.</p>
