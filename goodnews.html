          <p>Chinese specialty pharmaceutical company CF PharmTech experienced a remarkable surge of over 224% in its Hong Kong trading debut, raising approximately $78 million with shares priced at HKD$14.75 apiece. This strong performance contributed to a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market, which has collectively raised about $14.1 billion in the first half of the year. The company focuses on respiratory diseases, attracting significant investor interest despite mixed trading in Asia-Pacific markets following Wall Street losses. This successful listing highlights ongoing investor confidence in specific sectors within the region, even amidst broader economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sky-watchers worldwide were treated to a dazzling supermoon this week, appearing notably brighter and larger in the evening sky. This celestial event occurs when the moon reaches its perigee, its closest point to Earth in orbit, making it appear more prominent. Known as the Hunter's Moon, it marks the first full moon of October, a name rooted in historical preparations for winter in the Northern Hemisphere, when people would hunt and preserve meats. The phenomenon offered a beautiful and natural spectacle for observers across various global skylines, providing a moment of shared wonder.</p>

          <p>US scientist Dr. Fred Ramsdell learned he had won the Nobel Prize for medicine while on the final day of a three-week, off-grid hike in Montana's grizzly bear country, his phone previously on airplane mode. His wife, Laura O'Neill, discovered the news via numerous text messages, leading to Dr. Ramsdell's initial disbelief. He, along with two other scientists, was honored for groundbreaking research into how the immune system combats hostile infections, sharing a prize fund worth 11 million Swedish kronor. The Nobel Committee faced its most challenging attempt to contact a winner in years, eventually reaching him 20 hours later, making for a memorable announcement.</p>

          <p>Comedian Romesh Ranganathan is set to make his West End acting debut alongside Sheridan Smith in Alan Ayckbourn's "Woman in Mind," starting in December. Despite his extensive British entertainment career, Ranganathan acknowledges the risks of overexposure in the industry, jokingly stating he does decline offers. He evaluates projects based on quality, personal interest, and ability, recognizing the delicate balance between taking on work and maintaining public appeal. Ranganathan expresses both excitement and intimidation about working with the highly acclaimed Smith, viewing this opportunity as a significant step into stage acting for the first time since primary school.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-listed minerals explorer Trilogy Metals surged over 200% after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the Canadian company, involving a $35.6 million investment. This partnership aims to unlock domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper in Alaska's Ambler mining district, a move welcomed by Trilogy Metals. President Trump's decision to grant permits for the Ambler Road project reverses a previous administration's rejection, signaling a renewed federal commitment to responsible resource development. This initiative seeks to secure domestic supply chains for essential minerals crucial for energy infrastructure and defense, amidst China's dominance in the global critical minerals market.

          <p>The BBC show "Sort Your Life Out," hosted by Stacey Solomon, helps families declutter their homes, revealing the transformative impact of shedding unneeded possessions. Three featured families shared their key realizations: one mother aimed to break a shopping cycle for her children, another widower learned to let go of sentimental items to create a better space for his daughters, and a crafting enthusiast prioritized time with her kids over her hobbies. These personal stories illustrate how confronting emotional attachments to belongings, shifting priorities, and creating functional spaces can lead to significant improvements in family dynamics and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>A rare interstellar comet, 3I/ATLAS, the third ever confirmed to enter our solar system, was recently photographed closely approaching Mars by two European Space Agency orbiters. The images, taken when the comet was about 18.6 million miles from Mars, show a faint, fuzzy white dot moving against distant stars. Scientists describe this as a challenging observation due to the comet's extreme dimness compared to usual targets. This celestial visitor, discovered in July, will make its closest approach to the sun in late October, remaining visible through September before reappearing in December, offering valuable data for ongoing analysis by combining multiple images.</p>

          <p>Indonesia, encouraged by China's successful role in building Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway on Java, is now seeking further Chinese investment for expanding its travel network, including a 60km urban subway in Bali. The China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) is already involved in the $20 million Bali Urban Subway project, with the first line expected by 2031. The Jakarta-Bandung high-speed line has successfully cut travel time significantly, boosting confidence in Chinese-backed infrastructure development. However, the article's title hints at underlying concerns regarding potential debt implications, a common challenge with large-scale foreign-funded infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch is set to unveil a new economic "golden rule" aimed at reducing government borrowing and taxes, during her keynote speech at the party's conference. The proposed rule mandates that half of all future government savings be allocated to deficit reduction, with the other half directed towards economic growth policies, including tax cuts. Badenoch will position the Conservatives as the only party with a plan to stabilize the economy, accusing the Labour government of risking financial stability with a "borrowing and tax doom loop." This initiative seeks to rebuild the party's economic credibility and distance itself from past fiscal controversies, mirroring past conservative approaches to fiscal prudence.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the UK will not relax visa rules for India, ahead of his visit to the country to promote a recently signed trade agreement. Starmer emphasized "massive opportunities" to enhance trade and cultural ties but clarified that immigration policy remains unchanged, with no plans for new visa routes for Indian workers or students. The multi-billion pound trade deal, signed in July, aims to boost bilateral trade by making exports like UK cars and whisky cheaper. This stance aligns with the Labour government's broader efforts to reduce immigration levels, despite calls to attract global talent to grow the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The company did not confirm if it deferred plans to cut pay for small package deliveries by 65p, a measure that prompted the three-day action by self-employed and franchised drivers. Drivers had reported significant income cuts, making it difficult to manage household costs, even with increased rates for larger parcels. DPD maintains its remuneration package is competitive, having adjusted rates and introduced new incentive payments. The resolution avoids further disruption to delivery services, indicating a successful negotiation.</p>

He emphasizes that the current workforce lacks experienced gen AI users, necessitating a shift in corporate culture from rewarding "having answers" to "asking brilliant questions" and embracing continuous learning. Mollick advises leaders to actively use AI themselves, suggesting a $20/month subscription to tools like Claude or GPT for at least 10 hours a week to understand its capabilities. He warns against relying on slow AI task forces and waiting for vendors, advocating for immediate, hands-on experimentation to foster innovation.</p>

Coach JJ Redick praised Smart's intensity during live play, with teammates like Austin Reaves and Jarred Vanderbilt highlighting his immediate impact. Smart, a former Defensive Player of the Year, is expected to be a crucial defensive anchor for the Lakers, bringing both physicality and vocal leadership. His arrival, following a buyout from the Washington Wizards and recruitment by Luka Doncic, is anticipated to significantly bolster the team's defense, creating "havoc" on the court and raising expectations for their performance.</p>
