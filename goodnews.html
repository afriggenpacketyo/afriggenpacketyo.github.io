          <p>A Condor Airlines flight traveling from Greece to Germany executed a successful emergency landing in Brindisi, Italy, after the crew observed an issue near one of the engines. Passengers reported seeing flames, though the airline described it as a visible reaction within the engine's combustion chamber, prompting a controlled shutdown. All 273 passengers and eight crew members were unharmed, although some faced an uncomfortable night at the airport due to limited hotel capacity. The airline apologized for the inconvenience, emphasizing that safety remains its highest priority and arranged for another aircraft to complete the journey the following day.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is forecast to move parallel to the U.S. East Coast, avoiding direct landfall but generating dangerous rip currents and high waves. The storm, which fluctuated in intensity from a Category 5 to a Category 2, is expected to cause coastal flooding in North Carolina's Outer Banks, leading to evacuation orders. Forecasters warn that despite the storm remaining offshore, its large size will create hazardous ocean conditions for much of the week along the entire Eastern Seaboard. Authorities are urging the public to heed local warnings and stay out of the water due to the life-threatening risks.</p>

          <p>This article details the struggles of families seeking accountability from private equity-backed prison healthcare providers Corizon (now YesCare) and Wellpath, which have faced numerous lawsuits alleging negligent and fatal care. These companies filed for bankruptcy, a move that initially stalled wrongful death claims, such as one filed by the mother of Casey Norred, who died by suicide in a Florida jail. However, in an unusual turn, victims' families became active participants in the bankruptcy proceedings, forming committees that successfully negotiated for larger settlement funds and, in Wellpath's case, an equity stake in the reorganized company, potentially influencing its future operations.</p>

          <p>Actress Alicia Silverstone has revealed that she stepped back from her acting career after her rapid rise to fame in the 1990s because the experience "didn't feel as fun" anymore. Following the success of "Clueless," she felt unprepared for the intense scrutiny, particularly the public judgment of her appearance after her role in "Batman & Robin." Silverstone chose to redirect her energy towards activism, writing books on healthy living, and focusing on being a mother to her son. She has since returned to acting with a renewed passion, finding a better balance between her career and personal life, and currently stars in the new series "Irish Blood."</p>

          <p>Excel Dryer, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of electric hand dryers, has successfully transitioned to a 100% American-made supply chain, a long-held goal of its founder, Denis Gagnon. The company's leadership stated that the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, implemented under the Trump administration, reinforced their decision to onshore their parts sourcing. This strategic shift, which involved an eight-year search for a domestic motor supplier, was completed in 2023. By sourcing exclusively from within the United States, the company has insulated itself from international trade disputes and tariffs while fulfilling its vision of supporting domestic manufacturing.</p>

The report highlights a generational divide, with newer investors showing more optimism and a higher risk tolerance compared to more cautious, seasoned investors. Financial experts advise that all investors should continuously reassess their risk tolerance and goals, a process described as "always be calibrating." They recommend maintaining a diversified portfolio through accessible vehicles like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to navigate potential economic headwinds and market fluctuations effectively.

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that began on Saturday and disrupted travel for thousands. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) announced the deal, hailing it as a historic achievement that ends the practice of unpaid work during boarding and ground time. The airline confirmed the agreement and stated that flights would gradually restart, though a full return to service may take several days. The breakthrough occurred after talks resumed with a government-appointed mediator, following the union's defiance of a back-to-work order.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has characterized President Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine as a significant breakthrough in the peace process. Following a summit at the White House, Starmer expressed satisfaction with the progress, which also includes movement toward a potential meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Putin. European officials had been anxious about the summit, but leaders presented a united front, with the UK now focused on ensuring Ukraine negotiates from a position of strength. Diplomats believe Trump's pledge for "cast iron" U.S. involvement allows Ukraine more flexibility in future talks, even as the prospect of a pre-negotiation ceasefire appears to have diminished.</p>

          <p>The thong swimsuit, a fashion item that has recently seen a resurgence, was created by Austrian-American designer Rudi Gernreich as a political statement in 1974. Gernreich, a gay man and early LGBTQ+ rights activist, designed the minimalist garment to protest a ban on nude bathing at Los Angeles beaches. He viewed the thong not as a tool of sexualization but as a means of liberating the body from societal hang-ups. This act of rebellion was consistent with his career, which included creating the first topless swimsuit, the "monokini," in 1964 and championing unisex fashion long before it became mainstream.</p>

The claim follows a months-long transatlantic dispute where the UK Home Office issued a notice under its Investigatory Powers Act, which Apple challenged legally. The U.S. government, including President Trump, had strongly opposed the move, arguing it encroached on the civil liberties and privacy of American citizens. It remains unclear if the UK's technical notice will be fully withdrawn or altered, and whether Apple will restore its highest data protection options for new UK customers.</p>

While Merz has not committed to deploying the Bundeswehr, the debate is underway in Berlin.

Unlike the first wave, this boom is more mainstream, with matcha appearing in everything from lattes to desserts and skincare. The article suggests its current appeal lies in its adaptability; consumers often dilute its distinct, grassy flavor with milk, sugar, and syrups, making it a customizable and accessible entry point into a perceived wellness lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Spike Lee's new film, "Highest 2 Lowest," is a remake of Akira Kurosawa's 1960s thriller "High and Low," starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma. This article reviews the film, noting that while it follows the original's plot of a mistaken kidnapping, Lee infuses it with self-aware satire about his own evolution from a Brooklyn renegade to an established veteran. The film questions what happens when a tastemaker loses his edge, forcing its protagonist out of his luxury high-rise and into the city's grittier realities. Despite a chaotic start, the movie finds its footing with strong performances and Lee's signature energetic depiction of New York City.</p>

          <p>An increasing, though still small, number of men are choosing to become fathers on their own through surrogacy or adoption, a group now being termed "single fathers by choice." This trend, which has seen a notable rise in recent years, is driven by shifting societal norms, rising singlehood rates, and a reprioritization of life goals, particularly since the pandemic. While the path is often complex and expensive, organizations like Men Having Babies report a surge in interest from single men, both gay and straight.

While some supplements like creatine can offer modest benefits when used correctly, many, such as collagen, lack convincing scientific support. Experts advise consumers to be cautious, focus on obtaining nutrients from a healthy diet, and only use supplements if they have a documented deficiency, rather than believing unproven marketing claims.</p>
