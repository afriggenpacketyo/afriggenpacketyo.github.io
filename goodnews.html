          <p>The Parliament in England and Wales is currently debating a bill to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults, with significant amendments being considered. The bill has undergone intense scrutiny, including removing the requirement for a High Court judge's approval, instead proposing a panel of experts to oversee the process. Amendments under consideration aim to ensure no medical staff are obligated to participate and prevent doctors from discussing assisted dying with patients under 18 unless initiated by the patient. The debate is marked by emotional speeches and divided opinions, with concerns raised about the role of doctors and potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. The article emphasizes the historic nature of the potential change and the safeguards being proposed to protect individuals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's agreements to sell advanced chips and AI technology to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have ignited internal debate about potentially outsourcing the future of the AI industry. These deals, negotiated by administration officials with ties to venture capital, aim to boost American AI companies and expand their global reach. However, concerns have been raised that these agreements lack adequate protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China and could lead to the world's largest data centers being located in the Middle East instead of the United States.

          <p>Scientists are working on a project in Iceland called the Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) to build a magma observatory by drilling into a magma chamber and installing monitoring equipment. The goal is to revolutionize volcanology and improve eruption forecasting by gaining real-time data about the inner workings of volcanoes. This approach contrasts with current methods that rely heavily on pattern recognition based on past eruptions. The article draws a parallel to weather forecasting, where sophisticated models of the atmosphere have significantly improved predictions, and suggests that similar models of magma chambers could enhance volcanologists' ability to anticipate eruptions.</p>
