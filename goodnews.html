          <p>South Korea's military has observed North Korea removing some of its propaganda loudspeakers from the inter-Korean border, a potential sign of de-escalation. This action follows South Korea's own move to dismantle its speakers after its new president, Lee Jae Myung, halted anti-Pyongyang broadcasts to ease tensions. The tit-for-tat psychological warfare, which included blasting K-pop and critical messages, had recently intensified. While this development is a step towards reducing friction, tensions may rise again with upcoming large-scale U.S.-South Korea military exercises.</p>

          <p>Authorities have lifted the final evacuation orders related to the Canyon fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties, which has burned over 5,000 acres and is now 28% contained. The fire, which started Thursday, was fueled by a significant heat wave affecting Southern California, with inland areas experiencing triple-digit temperatures. While firefighting efforts are progressing, a Kern County Fire Department battalion chief was seriously injured in a vehicle rollover while working on the fire. The regional heat advisory is expected to remain in effect until Monday evening.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comparative taste test of 11 popular canned coconut milk brands has ranked Simply Asia's product as the worst option for consumers. The review, conducted by Chowhound, cited a poor texture reminiscent of curdled milk and a rancid taste. Unlike higher-ranked brands that were well-emulsified and creamy, Simply Asia's product was described as separated, oily, and containing overly solid chunks. The article advises shoppers to avoid this brand in favor of others, such as Target's Good & Gather, to ensure quality in their cooking and baking.</p>

          <p>A small meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been analyzed and found to be 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth. A University of Georgia geologist examined fragments of the space rock, which was part of a fireball seen across Georgia and South Carolina in June. The meteorite is believed to have originated from the breakup of a larger asteroid in the belt between Mars and Jupiter around 470 million years ago. Scientists have proposed naming it the "McDonough Meteorite."</p>

          <p>An abandoned 19th-century college campus in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood has been redeveloped into a 205-unit luxury apartment building called The Hartby. Developers spent over $104 million to renovate the historic St. John's College site, which had been deteriorating for decades. The project preserved original architectural elements like exposed brick and arched windows while adding modern amenities. Of the 205 units, 62 are designated for affordable housing, with market-rate rents ranging from $3,130 to $6,950 per month, blending historic preservation with new housing development.

A former federal judge, he was widely credited with troubleshooting the agencies and rebuilding public trust through his fair, non-political leadership. He left a long legacy of public service.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the well-known "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, has updated his guidance in a new book. He now suggests that a safe initial withdrawal rate could be closer to 4.7% for a 30-year retirement, thanks to more sophisticated portfolio diversification. Bengen argues that many retirees are too conservative and don't spend enough, and his research aims to help them maximize their nest egg. He notes that inflation is the greatest enemy of retirees and that certain strategies can help increase withdrawal rates safely. (not investment advice)</p>
