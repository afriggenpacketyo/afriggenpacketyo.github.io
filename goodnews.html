        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has announced its intention to introduce new legislation that will permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband confirmed the plan at the party's conference, stating that fracking would undermine climate commitments without reducing energy bills for consumers. This move formalizes a long-standing party position and sets up a clear policy contrast with Reform UK, which has advocated for reviving the controversial energy extraction practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Ralph Norman and other Republican colleagues have reintroduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment that would prevent members of Congress from receiving their salaries during a government shutdown. The proposed amendment states that lawmakers would not be compensated for any period in which a lapse in federal appropriations occurs, and they would not receive back pay. The move aims to hold Congress accountable for failing to fulfill its duty to fund the government, aligning their financial situation with that of the many federal workers who go unpaid during such events.</p>

          <p>Recently emerged photos on Chinese social media appear to show a new, tailless variant of China's next-generation J-50 stealth fighter. While not officially confirmed, military observers noted the aircraft in the images is missing a nose-mounted air data boom, a sensor typically used during early test flights. The removal of this equipment could signify that the secretive fighter program has reached a more advanced stage of its development and testing process.</p>

          <h2>The Psychological Benefits and Social Dynamics of Having a 'Best Friend'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of having a "best friend" provides significant psychological benefits into adulthood, offering a deeper level of trust, support, and intimacy that contributes to overall well-being and staves off emotional loneliness. Research suggests that people naturally, if subconsciously, rank their friendships, investing more time and emotional energy into a small inner circle. While the idea of a hierarchy can seem calculating, explicitly recognizing a best friend can strengthen the bond and provide clarity on which relationships to prioritize, ultimately leading to higher satisfaction and resilience.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Nears Herd Immunity for HPV-Caused Cervical Cancer Due to High Vaccination Rates</h2>

          <p>The United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, thanks to a successful and long-running gender-neutral vaccination program. A new study found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a dramatic decline in infections from cancer-causing HPV strains, even among unvaccinated women. Researchers caution that maintaining this community protection is dynamic and depends on sustaining high vaccine uptake to prevent a resurgence of the virus.</p>

          <p>In Nepal, a 2-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as the new Kumari, a living goddess revered by both Hindus and Buddhists. Selected from the Shakya clan based on strict traditional criteria, she will reside in a temple palace in Kathmandu until she reaches puberty, at which point she will return to mortal life. The tradition places the girl and her family in a position of high honor, though former Kumaris have historically faced challenges readjusting to a normal life after their duties conclude.</p>

          <p>Global real estate investment is increasingly shifting from traditional properties like offices to "invisible" assets such as data centers, driven by the explosive growth of AI and cloud computing. A recent survey found 95% of major investors plan to increase their data center holdings, with many allocating over $500 million. However, the immense cost of building these facilities, especially multi-billion-dollar hyperscale centers, is creating a potential funding gap as traditional lenders become strained by the sheer volume of capital required.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration abused its power and violated the First Amendment rights of non-citizens by targeting them for deportation based on their political speech. In a 161-page decision, Judge William Young stated that the government cannot imprison and deport people because of what they say, specifically citing the case of a student detained after co-authoring an op-ed on the war in Gaza. The ruling is being hailed as a major vindication of free speech rights for all residents, regardless of citizenship status.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "hoax" has its origins in the magician's incantation "hocus pocus," a phrase popularized in the 1620s as the stage name of a performer named William Vincent. The term "hocus pocus" itself may be a deliberate, playful corruption of the Latin Eucharistic prayer, "Hoc est enim corpus meum." Over time, the phrase became a shorthand for magic and trickery, and the shortened form "hoax" emerged around 1800 to describe a deception or fraud, evolving from stage magic to elaborate public deceptions.</p>
