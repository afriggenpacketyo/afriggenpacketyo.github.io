          <p>Todd Chrisley, star of "Chrisley Knows Best," was seen in public for the first time since receiving a full pardon from President Donald Trump following his conviction on fraud and tax evasion charges in 2022. Chrisley was spotted at a Nordstrom in Nashville with his family, including his daughter Savannah, who had advocated for his release. Trump announced the pardon earlier in the week, marking a significant turn in the legal saga of the reality TV star and his wife, Julie. Chrisley appeared happy as he went on his first public outing.</p>

The goal is to alleviate poverty, which Hanna identifies as a pathogen affecting children's health. The program has distributed approximately $10 million to over 2,200 families and is expanding to other areas of Michigan.</p>

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates suggests that global investors are reassessing their portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite aggressive tariffs towards Asia, Chinese equities have outperformed, making them attractive from a valuation perspective. Valuations remain compelling, and with falling interest rates, diversifying away from US equities is becoming increasingly appealing. The firm said global investors are showing more interest in non-US assets, even though most of the buying this year has come from local and mainland investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, ending one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The original complaint accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. The dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns, coinciding with efforts to portray the Trump administration as an ally to the crypto industry. Binance is also deepening its footprint in Pakistan, where Zhao was appointed as an adviser to the newly formed Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>
