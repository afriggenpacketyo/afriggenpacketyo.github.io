          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle has called on the police to "embrace change" as the Home Office and Treasury discuss the upcoming Spending Review. Kyle stated that all sectors of society are facing financial pressures and that the review aims to increase spending for schools and scientific research. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns over potential cuts to police numbers and urged the government to protect their budget. The government has already provided an additional ¬£1 billion to the police, and expects them to modernize and use technology to improve services. The police chiefs, including Sir Mark Rowley, have warned that years of cuts have left them with outdated technology. This article focuses on the negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury regarding police funding. The article does not contain investment advice.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Mark Travers identifies common conflict drivers in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, which is a predictor of divorce, while family arguments often reflect unmet needs. Uneven distribution of household labor is another common issue, with one partner often carrying the "invisible load." Communication styles can also derail conversations, with defensiveness, criticism, and stonewalling exacerbating conflicts.

          <p>A state-backed think tank has put forward China‚Äôs ‚Äúfour core principles‚Äù as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea, while blaming regional tensions on external actors. The think tank says these principles are resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing interference from external forces. Beijing‚Äôs expansive claims over the busy, resource-rich waters are contested by several member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Since 2023, face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed waters have become more frequent. This article outlines China's proposed framework for addressing South China Sea disputes.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how the threat of "peaceful evolution," the perceived danger of American conspiracies aimed at subverting and overthrowing the Communist Party, has receded for China due to Trump's policies.

However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts, and China has emerged as a major economic and political power. This article discusses the changing dynamics between the US and China.</p>
