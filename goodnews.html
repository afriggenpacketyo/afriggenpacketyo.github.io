          <p>A groundbreaking medical advance demonstrates that an enzyme-converted kidney, successfully transplanted into a brain-dead recipient, functioned for at least two days without signs of hyperacute rejection. This innovation, detailed in Nature Biomedical Engineering, offers a significant pathway to alleviate the critical shortage of donated organs and potentially shorten lengthy waiting lists. Researchers from the University of British Columbia and West China Hospital led the team, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient utilization of the available human organ pool. This development presents a promising, nearer-term solution compared to engineered animal organs, which remain years away from general practice due to recent failures in human applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of over $4,000 an ounce, driven by investor demand for safe-haven assets amidst global economic and political uncertainty. Factors contributing to this rally include the ongoing US government shutdown and a weakening US dollar, with analysts noting a more than 25% increase since April. While some experts predict an upward trend for at least five years, potential risks to the rally include future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve and an easing of geopolitical tensions. This article discusses various investment avenues, including physical gold and exchange-traded funds, highlighting gold's role as a hedge against market turbulence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts clarified his decision to not deploy ace reliever Roki Sasaki earlier in Game 2, citing a strategy of careful workload management for the young pitcher. Sasaki, a converted starter, has demonstrated dominance from the bullpen but the team remains cautious about using him on consecutive days given his recent shoulder injury and new role. Despite veteran Blake Treinen's struggles, which ultimately necessitated Sasaki's entry for the final out, Roberts emphasized Sasaki is now the primary option for save situations. The article highlights the delicate balance between maximizing Sasaki's impact and protecting his long-term health throughout the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Arizona Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon has reportedly been fined $100,000 for a sideline altercation with running back Emari Demercado. The incident occurred after Demercado dropped the ball before scoring a 72-yard touchdown, a blunder that contributed to the Cardinals' 22-21 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Gannon, who confronted Demercado on the sideline, later apologized, stating he "let the moment get the better of me." This marks the first time an NFL head coach has been fined for a player altercation since Bruce Arians in 2022.</p>

Dolly had previously cited the need for "a few procedures" and a lack of rehearsal time for the delay. This follows a recent diagnosis of a kidney stone and the passing of her husband earlier this year. Freida expressed confidence in Dolly's strength and the power of prayer for her recovery, reassuring fans that she believes her sister will be fine.</p>

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand expressed confidence that inflation is moderating and will return to its 2% target by early next year. The article highlights that lower interest rates are expected to support a recovery in consumption, while global trade volumes have remained resilient, with improved growth forecasts for key trading partners like China.

The introduction follows a period of falling sales and the expiration of a $7,500 U.S. tax credit, with CEO Elon Musk previously aiming for a sub-$30,000 price point after incentives. Analysts suggest these new offerings are more of a pricing adjustment than a product catalyst, and may not sufficiently address competition from lower-cost Chinese EVs or the need for a truly mass-market vehicle.
