          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are forging a stronger alliance in artificial intelligence, driven by the U.S.'s desire to lead the global AI race and the UAE's ambition to diversify its economy beyond oil. The partnership involves significant investments, with U.S. tech companies like OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia collaborating on projects in the UAE. This collaboration gives the UAE access to advanced American technology while providing the U.S. with resources needed to power AI data centers. The UAE has shifted its geo-economic focus from China to the U.S. to secure access to Nvidia chips, with the goal of becoming a major AI hub for emerging markets.</p>

          <p>A new patent in China's aeronautics industry signals a leap in jet engine technology with a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade. The improved heat resistance is expected to deliver greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) received the patent for advanced turbine blade manufacturing in late April. High-temperature alloy turbine blades are critical for modern jet engines, and this innovation aims to improve their thermal tolerance.</p>

          <p>Wolves forward Matheus Cunha is reportedly seeking a move to Manchester United, despite the club's absence of European football next season. Cunha views United as a big club and is excited by the challenge of reviving their fortunes. The move could benefit all parties, with Cunha joining a bigger club and Wolves receiving over ¬£60m to reinvest. United needs to boost its attacking options after a poor goal-scoring season, and Cunha is seen as someone who can make an instant impact.</p>

          <p>Puffin numbers on Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, have reached a record high of 43,626, despite global populations declining rapidly. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes the increase to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island. Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact. While puffins are thriving in Pembrokeshire, they are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually. Under the system, companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and carbon credits will have to be purchased for any emissions above that threshold. This is designed to incentivize companies to reduce emissions, though costs may be passed on to consumers.</p>
