          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the sale of over 18,000 of Nvidia's latest Blackwell artificial intelligence chips to Saudi company Humain. The announcement was made during a White House-led trip to Saudi Arabia, with President Trump present. The advanced Blackwell chips will power a 500-megawatt data center in Saudi Arabia, with the initial deployment using GB300 Blackwell chips. This deal underscores the strategic importance of Nvidia's AI chips and their role in international relations, particularly as countries compete for advanced AI technology.</p>

          <p>During a speech at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum in Riyadh, President Trump praised Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi leaders, highlighting their achievements in business and their country's development. Trump also criticized his predecessor's policies and emphasized the importance of Saudi Arabia's involvement in future initiatives. His comments, particularly his affinity for the Saudi leadership, drew attention given Saudi Arabia's historical role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Trump also touted his election victory, crackdown on undocumented immigration, and tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group PKK announced it would end its armed insurgency against Turkey, a move expected to impact Iraq and Syria. Experts emphasize the importance of subsequent actions, given the PKK's role within the broader Kurdish movement. The PKK's disarmament could influence the relationship between the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Syrian government, potentially leading to a halt in Turkish attacks in Syria. The decision could also affect Turkey's military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan and the future of PKK fighters, with some possibly relocating to Iraqi Kurdistan or SDF-controlled areas.</p>

          <p>Amid uncertainty caused by President Trump's ever-changing tariffs, consumers are advised to look for sales, check the origin of products, and purchase domestic goods to avoid price hikes. A recent U.S. agreement with China would reduce the level of U.S. taxes still in place on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%. Shoppers should consider purchasing items they were already planning to buy and possibly move the purchasing timeline up. Electronics and toys are the most likely to be hit the hardest by tariffs.</p>

          <p>Jennie Erin Smith's book, Valley of Forgetting, explores memory, medicine, and hereditary fate in rural Colombia, focusing on families affected by a rare genetic mutation linked to early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The book chronicles the experiences of families and scientists drawn together by the paisa mutation, which causes the illness in nearly everyone who inherits it. Smith suggests that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss; it might also be a chance to explore other forms of humanity grounded in feeling, presence, or touch. The book invites readers to reconsider memory as something relational, inherited, and timeless, rather than strictly personal and chronological.</p>
