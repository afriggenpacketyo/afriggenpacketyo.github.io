          <p>Oscar-winning actress Reese Witherspoon, 49, was spotted enjoying a sun-kissed getaway in the French Riviera with her financier boyfriend, Oliver Haarmann, 57. The couple packed on the PDA aboard a luxury yacht in Saint-Tropez, sharing laughs, kisses, and snorkeling adventures, looking visibly smitten. Witherspoon flaunted a cheeky white one-piece swimsuit, while Haarmann kept it casual in patterned swim trunks, enjoying their lavish holiday. Their romance sparked after Witherspoon and ex-husband Jim Toth announced their divorce in March 2023, and they were previously seen together in New York City last September.</p>

Fortunately, no injuries have been reported in connection with the contaminated items. Affected products are 11-oz. vacuum-packed packages of "ALL NATURAL al fresco CHICKEN SAUSAGE SWEET APPLE" with lot code 179 and a use/freeze by date of Oct. 1, 2025, advising consumers to discard or return them.</p>

          <h2>Bestselling Author Scott Galloway Argues 'Follow Your Passion' is Misleading Career Advice from Billionaires</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 10:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire and bestselling author Scott Galloway contends that the worst career advice billionaires often give is to "follow your passion," asserting that those who offer it are typically "already rich." Galloway, a serial entrepreneur and NYU marketing professor, instead advocates for identifying one's strengths and aligning them with opportunities that generate income. He emphasizes the importance of enduring rejection and being willing to pivot, echoing similar sentiments from Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach. This article suggests that success stems from a pragmatic combination of aptitude and market opportunity, rather consistently chasing a singular, often romanticized, pursuit of passion.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford's long-desired transfer to Barcelona appears closer, with reports indicating talks have begun for an initial loan with an option to buy. Rashford, who has been training separately from the main squad and believes he won't play for United under coach Ruben Amorim, sees Barcelona as his preferred destination. His potential exit would be a significant financial positive for Manchester United, as saving his £325,000-a-week salary would free up funds for squad strengthening. Barcelona's sporting director Deco has previously expressed admiration for the 27-year-old England international.</p>

However, financial experts like Joy Slabaugh caution that net worth can be a "misleading" metric, as it doesn't fully capture one's financial reality or liquidity. They recommend focusing instead on cash flow, progress toward personal goals, and aligning money management with core values for genuine financial well-being. Ultimately, financial comfort is often an emotional state derived from security, flexibility, and freedom, rather than a specific numerical target. (not investment advice)</p>
