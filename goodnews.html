          <p>The third Test match at Lord's between England and India is finely poised, with the scores level on first innings after three days of intense play. England's bowlers managed to take India's last four wickets for just 11 runs, dismissing the tourists for 387, thanks to key performances from Chris Woakes and captain Ben Stokes. The match, played in sweltering heat, has been a grueling battle of attrition, setting up a decisive final two days to determine the winner of the closely fought contest.</p>

          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's powerful 'ndrangheta mafia, Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Bogota, Colombia. Palermo, also known as "Peppe," was wanted under an Interpol red notice and is accused of managing vast cocaine trafficking operations from Latin America to Europe. His capture was the result of a coordinated effort between Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. The arrest highlights the global reach of the 'ndrangheta and represents a significant blow to its international drug trade operations.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova. The match, lasting just 57 minutes, was the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing a near-perfect performance. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title overall and demonstrates her mastery across all court surfaces, solidifying her position among the sport's elite. Anisimova, playing in her first major final, appeared to struggle with nerves throughout the lopsided contest.</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are initiating a judicial review against the government, arguing that current guidance on smartphones in schools is unlawful and unsafe for children. They contend that headteachers should not have discretion and that a complete ban on smartphones is necessary to protect students from harmful content and cyberbullying. In response, the Department for Education maintains that schools already possess the power to ban phones and that the new Online Safety Act provides additional, broader protections for children online.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators have gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, a major event celebrating Protestant traditions and heritage. The marches commemorate the 1690 Battle of the Boyne and feature lodges from Northern Ireland, Scotland, and beyond. This year's events, held in sunny weather, have been largely peaceful, with officials noting the importance of celebrating cultural identity in a non-confrontational manner. The main parades took place in cities like Belfast, Coleraine, and Keady.</p>

          <p>Forecasters are closely watching two areas for potential tropical storm formation in the Atlantic basin in mid-July. One system, a stalling front off the U.S. Southeast coast, presents a low risk of developing into a storm but is expected to bring increased rainfall and rough surf to the Carolinas and Florida. A second area of potential subtropical development is being monitored north of Bermuda, though it is not expected to impact land.

          <p>A CNBC analysis has ranked the economic strength of all 50 U.S. states, evaluating their preparedness for a potential recession amid risks from federal budget cuts and trade tariffs. The study considered factors like GDP and job growth, fiscal health, and exposure to a potential trade war. Florida, Texas, and North Carolina were ranked as the top three strongest economies, praised for their solid growth, strong finances, and relative insulation from international trade disputes. The report highlights how states are actively marketing their economic stability to attract businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. companies are increasingly using federally sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs amid ongoing trade disputes. These zones allow businesses to import components and assemble products without immediately paying duties, which are only collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, though a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product, creating new challenges for manufacturers.

          <p>Chris Kirby, founder of Ithaca Hummus, has grown his business from a small farmers market operation into a brand expecting $50 million in revenue this year. Starting with just a $450 blender while studying at Cornell University, Kirby identified a "culinary gap" for fresh, high-quality hummus. The company's success is attributed to a slow-and-steady growth strategy, focusing on deep penetration in existing markets rather than rapid, wide expansion. Kirby has maintained control by avoiding outside investors, allowing the company to remain profitable and focused on its long-term vision.</p>

However, the article notes that critics and even the government acknowledge the rules may already be outdated, as they do not fully address risks from AI chatbots, peer-to-peer messaging, or misinformation.</p>

While NASA's Artemis program officially has an earlier timeline for a crewed lunar landing, it faces significant technical hurdles.
