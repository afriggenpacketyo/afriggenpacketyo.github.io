          <p>Alex Palou became the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, triumphing over Marcus Ericsson in the final laps after a race filled with unusual incidents. Josef Newgarden's attempt to win a third consecutive Indy 500 was thwarted by a fuel pump issue, while Kyle Larson crashed out mid-race during his attempt to complete "the double." The race was marked by several crashes, including Scott McLaughlin on the warm-up lap and Marco Andretti on the first lap, as well as a pit road incident involving Robert Shwartzman injuring crew members. Palou's victory marks a significant achievement in his already impressive IndyCar career.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst speculation of a Man City rebuild, Pep Guardiola defended his decision to leave out Jack Grealish, while major changes are anticipated both on and off the pitch. Key players like Kevin de Bruyne are departing, and potential exits loom for Kyle Walker and others, with new signings already made in defense. Guardiola downplayed the need for a significant overhaul, emphasizing the strength of his existing squad. The club is financially strong, but faces important decisions during this period of transition, including the departure of long-time associate Begiristain and the arrival of a new director of football.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani threw a live batting practice session, marking a significant step in his recovery from Tommy John surgery. Ohtani threw 22 pitches to hitters, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and utilizing his full repertoire. The session was his first time facing live hitters in 641 days and the first in a Dodger uniform. While the Dodgers are cautious about setting a specific timeline, manager Dave Roberts indicated that Ohtani is unlikely to pitch in any major league games until after the All-Star break.</p>
