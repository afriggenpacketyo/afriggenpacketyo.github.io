          <h2>President Trump's Scotland Visit Focuses on Unfinished UK-US Trade Deal Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:43:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland is strategically aimed at cementing warm ties with the UK and addressing unresolved aspects of a recent trade deal. Key discussions involve the potential removal of a 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, provided British steel is domestically sourced, and the US push to eliminate the UK's digital services tax impacting tech companies. While the initial deal commenced in June, certain commitments remain in negotiation. Analysts suggest this meeting could yield positive headline announcements, improving UK-US relations within the context of an August 1 global trade deadline.</p>

          <h2>India Remains Resilient as US Trade Deadline Approaches Amid Geopolitical Balancing Act</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:43:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is maintaining a steadfast posture as a crucial August 1 trade deadline with the U.S. looms, potentially triggering increased tariffs. This confidence stems partly from its recently finalized "historic" trade deal with the UK, which successfully protected India's sensitive agricultural sectors, signaling its intent to trade on its own terms. The U.S. has strategic reasons to secure a deal, seeing India as a vital partner to counterbalance China's global manufacturing dominance and influence in the Indo-Pacific. India's multi-alignment strategy, including its BRICS role, provides significant leverage, enabling it to pursue diversified trade agreements and mitigate global economic shocks.</p>

          <h2>UK Retail Sales Rebound in June, Driven by Warm Weather and Fuel Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:28:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes experienced a 0.9% increase in June, largely attributed to the unusually hot weather, which significantly boosted fuel and supermarket sales. The Office for National Statistics reported a rise in drink purchases at supermarkets, alongside increased fuel sales as consumers ventured out in the sunshine. However, this modest rebound followed a substantial 2.8% decline in May, which was revised to be worse than initially estimated, and June's rise still fell short of many economists' forecasts. Overall, the article highlights a loss of momentum in retail spending, with sales up by a mere 0.2% over the April-June quarter, consistent with broader indicators of weakening consumer confidence.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have signed a "historic" free trade agreement, projected to boost bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually by 2040. The deal, finalized after three years of negotiations, significantly reduces duties on goods like textiles, alcohol, and automobiles, with 92% of UK exports to India and 99% of Indian goods to Britain seeing tariff reductions or exemptions. This agreement offers substantial benefits, including reduced tariffs on Scotch whisky and automotive products, and supports Indian sectors like textiles and jewelry. Both nations view the pact as a strategic win, providing leverage in ongoing trade talks with other partners like the US. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UFC middleweight Robert Whittaker is poised for his return to the octagon in Abu Dhabi, nine months after sustaining a severe jaw injury that resulted in his bottom teeth collapsing during a previous fight. Whittaker, who underwent surgery to extract and implant several teeth, humorously remarked that the injury itself was less painful than the subsequent recovery process of wiring his jaw. The article highlights his long history with dental issues, preventing him from biting an apple for nearly 15 years. Now, with new implants, Whittaker expresses a renewed sense of well-being. He states that while regaining his former title remains an objective, his primary drive is to set an example for his children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will formally recognize Palestine as a state, a significant diplomatic move to be finalized at the UN General Assembly in September. This decision, made amid escalating global outrage over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, positions France as the largest Western power to take such a step, potentially influencing other nations. Macron underscored the immediate necessity of halting the war in Gaza and safeguarding the civilian population. Israel, however, swiftly condemned the recognition, arguing it rewards terror and risks establishing a Palestinian state that could threaten its security. This announcement coincides with increasing international pressure on Israel and upcoming multinational talks concerning Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Bullingham, chief executive of the Football Association, has expressed his firm opposition to expanding the current scope of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. He argues that there are already "enough interruptions to the game in the current model," negating any need to extend VAR's powers to cover decisions such as corner kicks or second yellow cards. While the International FA Board (Ifab), which governs football's laws, regularly discusses VAR's evolution, the FA, holding a seat on the body, believes the system is currently in a good place. This stance reflects a preference for maintaining game flow over introducing further technological interventions for decision accuracy.</p>

          <p>Wales is set to introduce a UK-first initiative providing debit-style cards preloaded with money to help individuals with coeliac disease and other gluten sensitivities purchase gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the current prescription model, aiming to "de-medicalize the supply of gluten-free foods." The cards will be accepted at most places selling gluten-free products, including supermarkets and online stores. While the exact amount provided will vary, the scheme is anticipated to be cost-neutral for the NHS. This move seeks to ease the financial burden on coeliacs, whose diet can add 35% to food bills, and promote healthier choices.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley expresses feeling "refreshed and recharged" as he enters his fourth season, despite mounting pressure to elevate the team's performance following a disappointing 7-6 record.

While acknowledging existing challenges, such as an unproven quarterback and an inexperienced offensive line, Riley views the program as having progressed beyond major structural issues to focusing on "finishes." He highlights significant improvements in defensive depth and talent, expressing confidence in the team's overall trajectory and the momentum generated by a top recruiting class.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a new executive order aimed at fundamentally reshaping college sports, granting federal agencies authority to enforce new provisions concerning athletic scholarships and name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals. The order seeks to safeguard non-revenue women's and Olympic sports by mandating that the highest-earning athletic departments maintain specific scholarship numbers. It also targets "pay-for-play" NIL arrangements, deeming them inappropriate, while permitting deals that reflect "fair market value." This executive action follows a class-action settlement that opened the door for direct payments to athletes, intensifying anxieties about resource allocation within collegiate athletics. Legal experts, however, question the order's immediate binding power, viewing it primarily as a signal of escalating federal involvement.</p>
