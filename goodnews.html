          <p>Kinloch Castle, a Victorian-era hunting lodge on the Scottish Isle of Rum, is back on the market with an asking price over £750,000. The property, owned by the government agency NatureScot, is in need of significant restoration after a previous sale to a millionaire businessman fell through. The local community of about 40 residents has expressed a strong desire for any new owner to be committed to supporting the island's nature and economy. The sale represents a unique opportunity to restore a significant piece of Scottish heritage while integrating with the small island community.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Alex Padilla of California deflected questions about a potential run for governor in 2026, stating his current focus is on a November special election to redraw the state's congressional districts. While not ruling out a future candidacy, Padilla emphasized the importance of the redistricting effort, which he framed as a necessary counter to Republican attempts to "rig the system." The gubernatorial field remains open after former Vice President Kamala Harris declined to run, leaving many voters undecided. Padilla highlighted his extensive experience in California politics as a potential asset for the role.</p>

          <p>Former NBA player Gilbert Arenas is rebranding his digital show to focus on the NFL, partnering with sports commentator Skip Bayless for a new program titled "The Arena: Gridiron." The show, which will also feature former coach Jay Gruden and cornerback Aqib Talib, comes as both Arenas and Bayless are dealing with separate legal issues. Arenas was recently charged with running an illegal gambling business, while Bayless is a defendant in a lawsuit from a former colleague. Despite the controversies, Bayless expressed his excitement to return to the debate format on the new platform.</p>

          <p>Google's YouTube TV and Fox Corp. have reached a short-term contract extension, preventing Fox channels like Fox News and Fox Sports from being removed from the streaming service. The previous agreement was set to expire just days before major college football and NFL games were scheduled to air. The dispute centers on the fees YouTube TV pays to carry Fox's content, which Google claims are "far higher" than those for comparable offerings. This temporary truce allows service to continue for YouTube TV's 9.4 million subscribers while negotiations for a new long-term deal proceed.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has created a new trophy, the Vedder Cup, for the rivalry series between the Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres. The trophy is a custom Fender Telecaster guitar that was personally played by its namesake, Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, before being presented. Vedder, who has strong ties to both cities, hand-drew art on the guitar and included a logo for a nonprofit he co-founded. The Mariners secured the inaugural cup by winning the season series, and the trophy guitar is intended to be played rather than displayed.</p>

The company's data center division, which fuels the artificial intelligence boom, saw its revenue grow to $41.1 billion, although this figure slightly missed analyst estimates. Despite the strong performance, Nvidia noted it sold no H20 chips to China due to U.S. restrictions, which impacted potential sales. The company projects continued robust growth, forecasting $54 billion in revenue for the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a record number of consumers committing to monthly car payments of $1,000 or more, financial experts at Edmunds have outlined key mistakes to avoid. These include buying a vehicle outside one's means, relying solely on dealership financing without securing a preapproved loan, and trading in a car with negative equity. The article also advises working with a dealership's internet sales team for better pricing and considering certified pre-owned vehicles to avoid the steep depreciation of a new car. These strategies can help buyers maintain financial stability in an increasingly expensive auto market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut appearing likely in September, savers are advised to act strategically to lock in current high rates on certificates of deposit (CDs). Financial experts recommend shopping at online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It is also crucial for savers to accurately determine the amount they can afford to deposit to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Finally, securing the longest-term CD possible within one's budget can maximize returns and protect principal from future rate decreases and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As homeowners navigate their financing options, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) presents a compelling choice for September. Current HELOC rates are significantly lower than those for personal loans and credit cards, making it one of the most affordable borrowing methods available. Furthermore, with the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, the variable rates on HELOCs are positioned to become even cheaper. Rising home equity levels also mean that homeowners have a larger pool of funds to draw from for major expenses or investments. (not investment advice)</p>
