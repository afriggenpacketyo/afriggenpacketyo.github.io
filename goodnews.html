          <p>The final fight in the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy is analyzed not just as a sporting event, but as a profound statement on women's right to choose their path in a dangerous profession. This article contrasts the spectacle of high-stakes boxing with the underlying fight for equality, suggesting that true progress is the right for female athletes to fight strategically, even if it is not a chaotic brawl. It reflects on the complex relationship between risk, glory, and female autonomy in professional boxing, where athletes reclaim their bodies for defiance rather than just survival.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid strike before crashing into the Sahara desert. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin, making it an exceptionally rare find, as it represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material currently on our planet. The auction also features a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for peace in the region. This move follows a call from imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan to end the separatist insurgency. While the Turkish government has cautiously welcomed the development, the success of the peace process will hinge on significant concessions, including potential amnesty for fighters and the release of thousands of Kurdish political prisoners.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study provides a surprising insight into the impact of China's dams on the Brahmaputra River, which flows into India and is a source of geopolitical tension. Contrary to fears that a new mega-dam in Tibet could cause droughts, data from two existing upstream dams suggests the opposite may be true. The study found that since 2014, water flows downstream during the dry season have significantly increased, with a more than 50% rise in February. This indicates the dams may be alleviating rather than exacerbating water scarcity for India.</p>
