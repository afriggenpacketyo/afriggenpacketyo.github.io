          <p>The Princess of Wales, Catherine, has withdrawn from her planned attendance at Royal Ascot as she continues her gradual return to public life following her cancer diagnosis last year. Kensington Palace confirmed that she would not be attending the races, where she was scheduled to appear in the carriage procession with her husband, Prince William. Catherine was last seen at the Order of the Garter service in Windsor, and she has recently increased her public appearances, including attending Trooping the Colour and visiting the V&A East Storehouse museum. The Princess revealed in January that she is in remission from cancer and is focused on staying cancer-free, though she noted she is "not out of the woods yet."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is expected to extend the deadline for ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. business, marking the third time he has paused the enforcement of a bipartisan law. The extension will last 90 days, during which the administration aims to finalize a deal ensuring the safety and security of American users' data. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump does not want TikTok to go dark.

However, the four-week average of claims has risen to its highest point since August 2023, indicating a potential deceleration in the U.S. job market. While employers are still adding jobs, the pace has slowed compared to previous years, partly due to Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and the impact of Trump's trade policies.

          <p>The article explores the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, delving into the ethics, stigma, and history of gossip and who gets to participate. While studies show that men and women gossip at similar rates, women tend to gossip neutrally more often, giving them more practice in social conversation. The article suggests that men's perceived lack of skill in gossip stems from cultural constraints and a fear of appearing "messy" or stirring the pot. Ultimately, the piece considers whether improving men's gossiping skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic by fostering deeper connections and intimacy.</p>

The toy collection gained popularity after Lung partnered with Chinese toy company POP MART in 2019, and it has since been spotted on the bags of celebrities. The appeal of Labubu dolls is further enhanced by their sale in 'blind boxes,' which add an element of surprise and the chance to unbox a rare 'secret' doll.</p>
