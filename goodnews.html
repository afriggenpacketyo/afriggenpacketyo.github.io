          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, establishing tariffs of 20% on goods from Vietnam and 40% on goods transshipped through the country. In exchange, the agreement reportedly grants U.S. products zero-tariff access to Vietnamese markets, with a specific mention of increasing SUV exports. The article clarifies that despite the president's phrasing, these tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, not by Vietnam. This development follows a period of tariff negotiations after the U.S. initially proposed a steep 46% tariff on Vietnamese imports.</p>

This move comes as the Tibetan spiritual leader approaches his 90th birthday and addresses Beijing's assertions that it must approve his successor.
