          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that a deal has been reached concerning TikTok, the popular social media app owned by China's ByteDance. The announcement comes as the administration faced a September 17 deadline to either divest the app's U.S. operations or shut it down over national security concerns. Trump mentioned in a social media post that the deal involves a company "young people in our Country very much wanted to save" and that he plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. The article notes previous extensions and potential buyers for the platform's U.S. business.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value increased after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's shares since 2020, acquiring approximately $1 billion worth of stock. The significant insider buy is being interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle manufacturer's future. This move comes as Tesla's sales have faced headwinds, partly attributed to Musk's political activities and increased competition. Analysts view the purchase as Musk reinforcing his commitment to Tesla's long-term strategy, particularly its focus on artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 08:34:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings quarterly to a semiannual basis, a change that would require SEC approval. He argued the shift would save money and encourage a focus on long-term corporate management rather than short-term results. The article contrasts this proposal with current practices in the U.S. and China, which both require quarterly reports, and notes it would align more closely with regulations in the UK and EU. The idea of reducing the frequency of corporate reporting has been previously supported by figures like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon to promote long-term thinking. (not investment advice)</p>

Sze's appointment comes during a period of turmoil for the institution following the controversial firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden by President Trump. Sze, known for his works influenced by ancient Chinese poetry and American landscapes, succeeds Ada Limón for a one-year term. He plans to use his platform to focus on the art of translation, which he credits with helping him learn the craft of writing poetry and making it more accessible to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>A data analysis reveals that African nations are increasingly vital to the global supply of critical minerals essential for technologies like smartphones and renewable energy infrastructure. The continent is a dominant producer of cobalt, platinum, and manganese, and the International Monetary Fund estimates that the green energy transition could boost sub-Saharan Africa's GDP by 12% over 25 years. However, challenges remain in ensuring that the revenue from this resource boom is shared equitably and benefits local communities. Experts stress the need for better governance to prevent exploitation and maximize the economic potential for the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Market research indicates that convenience stores are increasingly winning over breakfast customers from traditional fast-food restaurants. In a recent three-month period, morning meal traffic to food-focused convenience stores grew by 9%, while fast-food chains saw only a 1% increase. Chains like Wawa and Casey's are successfully competing by expanding their fresh food offerings, providing variety, and capitalizing on the convenience of customers already stopping for gas. This trend reflects a shift in consumer habits, as diners seek value and a wider range of options for their morning meal, posing a significant challenge to fast-food giants like McDonald's.

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign the "Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy," an agreement aimed at accelerating the development of new nuclear power projects in both countries. The deal, expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit, intends to halve regulatory approval times and unlock private investment to enhance energy security and create jobs. A key part of the agreement involves a commercial deal for U.S.-based X-Energy and the UK's Centrica to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool. Critics, however, raise concerns about the high costs and long construction timelines associated with nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>A new report from TransUnion shows an increasing number of renters are reporting their monthly rent payments to credit bureaus as a way to improve their credit scores. This practice is particularly beneficial for those with limited or no credit history, as including on-time rent payments can lead to a significant score increase. The trend is most popular among younger generations like Gen Z and millennials, who are more likely to rent. The article advises consumers to ask key questions before enrolling in a reporting service, such as understanding the costs, ensuring it reports to all three major bureaus, and knowing its policy on reporting late payments.</p>

          <p>China has released an action plan to significantly expand its new-energy storage capacity, aiming to almost double its current world-leading levels by 2027. The plan, primarily focused on lithium-ion battery technology, targets a capacity of over 180 gigawatts, supported by an anticipated investment of $35 billion. This expansion is deemed essential for stabilizing the power grid as the country rapidly grows its renewable energy sector to meet its carbon neutrality goals. The initiative also includes developing alternative storage technologies like hydrogen and compressed air, reflecting strong domestic and international demand for energy storage solutions.

New studies show the initiative has lowered rates of maternal postpartum depression, improved housing stability, and led to better infant health outcomes, saving millions in neonatal intensive care costs. Born from the advocacy that followed the city's water crisis, Rx Kids is the first community-wide, unconditional cash program of its kind in the U.S. and is gaining bipartisan interest for expansion.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has launched an ambitious conservation project aiming to eradicate invasive predator species like possums, rats, and stoats by 2050 to save its unique native bird populations. These non-native mammals have driven dozens of bird species to extinction and threaten most of those remaining. A key component of this massive undertaking is the widespread participation of community volunteers, including students and homeowners, who set traps in local parks and their own backyards. This grassroots involvement is considered crucial for the project's success, as it fosters social buy-in for the difficult but necessary work of protecting the nation's vulnerable wildlife.</p>

Following the decision, Cash described the two years since his arrest as a "nightmare" and expressed relief that "justice has been served."
