          <p>Taylor Swift announced she has bought back the masters of her first six studio albums, which were previously sold to Scooter Braun in 2019 and later to Shamrock Capital. The pop star expressed immense joy at owning her music outright, fulfilling a long-held aspiration. Swift also revealed that she has completed rerecording her debut album and is contemplating releasing vault tracks from "Reputation," an album she initially felt couldn't be improved upon. This move marks a significant victory for Swift, granting her full autonomy over her early discography and allowing her to control the narrative around her music.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its COVID-19 vaccine guidance, stating that healthy children "may receive" the vaccine rather than issuing a broad recommendation. This change follows an announcement that the agency would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The CDC still recommends the vaccine for immunocompromised children and most adults, and maintains that vaccination during pregnancy is safe and beneficial. These changes reflect ongoing discussions about the evolving risk profile of COVID-19 and the appropriate vaccination strategies for different populations.</p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid on June 1 after Liverpool accepted a fee of 10 million euros to release him early from his contract. The 26-year-old right-back has agreed to a six-year deal with a 1 billion euro buy-out clause, allowing him to participate in the Club World Cup. Liverpool has already signed Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen for 35 million euros as Alexander-Arnold's replacement. This move marks a significant change for both clubs as Real Madrid gains a prominent player and Liverpool adjusts its squad accordingly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers are advised to take proactive steps to manage their finances. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt, locking in high-yield savings rates, and improving credit scores to mitigate the impact of high borrowing costs. Switching to a zero-interest balance transfer credit card or consolidating debt with a lower-rate personal loan can significantly reduce interest payments. Additionally, moving funds to a high-yield savings account can provide better returns before rates potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) found that two New York state agencies violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act with their ban on Native American-inspired mascots and logos. The investigation was prompted by a complaint from the Native American Guardians Association (NAGA), which argued that the state agencies forced Massapequa School District to retire its mascot. The Department of Education also found the policy to be discriminatory as it did not permit Native American-inspired mascots while allowing others derived from different racial or ethnic groups. The proposed resolution includes rescinding the ban and issuing apology letters to Indigenous tribes.</p>
