          <p>This article challenges the romanticized view of the 1990s, arguing that data shows significant improvements in the present day. Citing "nostalgia bias," the author points to several key areas where modern life is demonstrably better, including drastically lower violent crime rates and a significant reduction in global extreme poverty. The piece also highlights major public health advancements, such as the successful fight against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and increased social tolerance and educational attainment. It concludes that while the 1990s had positive aspects, objective measures indicate substantial progress since then.</p>

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, surpassing Wall Street expectations and prompting the company to raise its full-year revenue guidance. This growth comes despite new tariffs on goods from Vietnam, where On sources about 90% of its products, which it has offset with price increases that have not dampened consumer demand. The sneaker brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors like Nike, saw strong performance across all regions, particularly in the Americas and China. The company's success is attributed to its premium positioning and a balanced direct-to-consumer and wholesale strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% jump in second-quarter revenue to $658.1 million in its first earnings report as a public company. This growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which reached $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance and positive guidance caused the company's shares to rise. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the success to growing interest from major financial institutions following the passage of supportive crypto legislation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken rival Meituan in daily orders, signaling a major shift in China's highly competitive on-demand delivery sector. This change is attributed to Alibaba's aggressive use of subsidies for customers, merchants, and delivery riders to capture market share. While Meituan remains dominant in food delivery, analysts predict that the broader instant commerce market is evolving into a "near-duopoly." A Morgan Stanley report forecasts that by 2030, Alibaba and Meituan could hold nearly equal shares of the on-demand delivery market in terms of gross transaction value.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty has acquired Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, in a $1 billion deal, marking a significant expansion for the cosmetics company. The acquisition comes as E.l.f. continues its streak of 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, driven by its affordable-yet-premium products that resonate with younger consumers. Despite concerns over financing the deal with debt and a recent dip in net income linked to China tariffs, analysts are cautiously optimistic. The move will bring E.l.f. into Sephora stores and further challenge legacy beauty players like Estée Lauder and L'Oréal.</p>

          <p>With rising temperatures, pet owners are advised to take extra precautions to keep their animals safe from the heat. The RSPCA warns that exercise is a common trigger for heatstroke in dogs and recommends avoiding walks during the hottest parts of theday. A simple test is to check if the pavement is too hot to comfortably hold a hand on for five seconds. The article outlines the signs of heatstroke, such as excessive panting and confusion, and provides cooling tips like offering shaded areas, plenty of water, and using pet-safe sunscreen on vulnerable areas.</p>

          <h2>United States and China Agree to Extend Trade Truce for an Additional 90 Days</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 07:50:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have extended their trade truce by another 90 days, delaying a scheduled escalation of tariffs that was set to take effect. The pause, which now lasts until November 10, keeps U.S. levies on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the extension provides more time for negotiations on trade imbalances and other economic issues. This move avoids immediate trade turmoil but continues a period of uncertainty for businesses, as trade flows between the two economic giants have already been significantly impacted this year.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence has become a widely used tool among K-12 educators, who are leveraging it to save time on administrative work like creating lesson plans, grading rubrics, and writing report card comments. Specialized platforms like MagicSchool AI are now used by millions of teachers, and some large school districts are officially rolling out chatbots for classroom use. However, this adoption is happening alongside concerns about students using AI to cheat and the potential for AI-generated errors in curriculum materials. The rapid integration of AI presents a complex challenge for schools, balancing efficiency gains with pedagogical integrity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a massive, 1,550-mile-long ecosystem in the hadal zone, the deepest part of the ocean between Russia and Alaska. This community of life, including new species of clams and tube worms, thrives in total darkness through chemosynthesis, using methane seeping from the seafloor as its energy source instead of sunlight. The discovery suggests that such ecosystems may be common in other deep-sea trenches and that these areas play a larger role in the global carbon cycle than previously understood. The finding highlights how much of the deep ocean remains unexplored and the unique ways life can adapt to extreme environments.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to arbitration, a process where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote before he was a coach to destroy his career. This ruling allows his case for damages and accountability to be heard by a public jury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores several of Germany's unusual laws that can surprise visitors and residents alike, reflecting a culture that is both laissez-faire in some areas and highly regulated in others. Among the quirky rules is the "Tanzverbot" or dancing ban on Good Friday, a "silent holiday" where many noisy activities are forbidden. Other strange regulations include prohibitions on building large sandcastles on certain beaches to prevent erosion, a strict ban on mowing lawns on Sundays to preserve "Ruhezeit" or quiet time, and it being illegal to run out of fuel on the Autobahn.</p>
