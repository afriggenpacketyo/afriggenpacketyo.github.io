          <p>Experts in radiation hazards suggest that a U.S. 'bunker buster' bomb strike on Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant would likely result in localized contamination. Emily Caffrey notes that the uranium hexafluoride gas used at the site is heavy and wouldn't travel far, posing minimal risk to those outside the immediate area. Edwin Lyman adds that the uranium isotopes present are at the lower end of hazard regarding radioactive materials. The IAEA has been monitoring the effects of strikes on Iran's facilities, reporting that radioactivity levels outside the Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant remained normal after an attack, though there was radiological and chemical contamination inside.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials showed the drug to be highly effective, with 99.9% of participants remaining HIV negative. Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, hailed the approval as a major milestone in the fight against HIV, suggesting it could help end the epidemic. However, some experts warn that the Trump administration's recent decision to cut funding for HIV vaccine research could hinder further progress, with one immunology professor warning that research could be set back a decade.</p>

Fed Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the economy's relative strength, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but acknowledged that the Trump administration's tariffs could drive up inflation and slow growth.

The highest temperatures are expected on Friday and Saturday, potentially reaching 33C. Yellow heat health alerts are in place for most of England, indicating a greater risk to vulnerable individuals. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where temperatures could reach nearly 40C. The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat-health alerts for all regions of England except the North East and North West.</p>
