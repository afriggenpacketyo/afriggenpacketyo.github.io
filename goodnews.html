          <p>Following a U.S.-brokered peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced a global initiative to nominate former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. Johnson is collaborating with the speaker of the Israeli Knesset to rally parliamentary leaders worldwide for the joint nomination. The deal, which saw the release of all living Israeli hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, has been credited to Trump's diplomatic efforts. Johnson stated that no one is more deserving of the prize, calling it an "objective fact."</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively moving to control every layer of its business, from custom chip development to consumer hardware, in a strategic pivot to build a complete AI ecosystem. The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, similar to Apple's vertical integration with its M-series chips. This hardware focus is part of a broader campaign called Stargate, which also includes massive deals with Nvidia and AMD for computing power. By also acquiring Jony Ive's design firm and launching an app store, OpenAI aims to become the central platform for AI development, making its technology harder to replace.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, UK Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed the House of Commons with a nuanced statement, tempering celebration with cautious pragmatism. While acknowledging Donald Trump's central role in the deal, Starmer emphasized the long road ahead for a permanent peace and highlighted Britain's behind-the-scenes support. The response from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch was notably partisan, attacking Starmer and downplaying the UK's role. However, several Conservative backbenchers broke from their leader, offering constructive contributions and implicitly condemning her divisive tone.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The court's decision finalizes the record-breaking sum Jones was ordered to pay to the families of the victims who were harassed and threatened by his followers. The judgment was awarded by a Connecticut jury in 2022 for defamation and emotional distress. Jones's lawyers had argued to the Supreme Court that the amount could never be paid.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has sanctioned two Chinese nationals, Chen Zhi and Qiu Wei Ren, accused of running large-scale scam centers in Cambodia and Myanmar that used forced labor. The men allegedly masterminded fake romance and cryptocurrency scams that defrauded vulnerable people worldwide. As part of the sanctions, enacted jointly with U.S. authorities, their assets have been frozen, including 19 properties in London valued at over £100 million. The operations reportedly lured foreign nationals with promises of legitimate jobs before forcing them to carry out scams under threat of torture.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. Average HELOC rates have dropped to around 7.84%, making them significantly cheaper than they were a year ago and more competitive than credit cards or personal loans. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they could become even less expensive if the central bank continues its rate-cutting trend. The article advises that a rate at or below the current average can be considered good, but homeowners should shop around and maintain a strong credit profile to secure the best offer.

In a speech, Powell noted that signs of tightening liquidity in the financial system suggest the Fed may approach its target for bank reserves in the coming months. The QT process, which began in 2022, has shrunk the Fed's balance sheet from a peak of around $9 trillion to $6.6 trillion.

          <p>In the wake of devastating wildfires, California officials are fast-tracking a large-scale fire prevention project in the Santa Monica Mountains. The strategy involves creating a web of fuel breaks by clearing native chaparral, with plans for prescribed burns and the use of goat and sheep herds to graze on flammable invasive grasses. This effort is supported by an executive order from Governor Gavin Newsom that streamlines the environmental approval process for such projects. While fire officials support the tactical advantages of fuel breaks, some fire ecologists express concern that, if not carefully managed, clearing chaparral could inadvertently make the landscape more prone to fire.</p>
