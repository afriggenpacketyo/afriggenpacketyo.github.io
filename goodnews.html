          <p>Donald Trump stated in an interview that he has organized a consortium of "very wealthy people" prepared to acquire TikTok, with their identities to be revealed within two weeks. This development occurs as the platform faces a potential U.S. ban unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests its American operations due to national security concerns. The deadline for this divestiture has been extended to September 17, with Trump expressing a desire to see the popular app continue under new, American-friendly ownership.</p>

          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers report experiencing motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency slowing caused by regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. Chinese researchers are exploring solutions, including engineering adjustments and even introducing specific audio tones, to counteract the physiological effects and improve passenger comfort.</p>
