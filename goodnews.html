        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan and the United States are currently engaged in negotiations regarding tariffs, with both countries aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement by mid-June. Despite ongoing discussions, significant differences remain between the two sides, according to Tokyo's top negotiator. Simultaneously, a survey reveals that over half of rice-producing firms in Japan believe that store prices for rice are excessively high, reflecting concerns shared with consumers about the rising cost of this staple food, as household complaints about doubled rice prices increase, causing worries that consumers may start avoiding the product. This article provides an overview of both trade negotiations and domestic economic concerns in Japan. The sentiment leans towards cautious optimism as trade talks progress and efforts are made to address rising food costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade of interviewing parents of highly successful children, the author identifies five key strategies: fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, recognizing that learning happens everywhere, cultivating a love of knowledge, and motivating with love rather than coaching. The parents of high-achieving children encouraged their kids to think big, feel hope, and stay positive, instilling a sense of possibility. Developmental psychologists are shifting focus from encouraging hard work to fostering a deep curiosity and love of learning. This article highlights the importance of parental support and encouragement in a child's development, with love and joy being central to helping children grow.</p>

          <p>Japan and the European Union are preparing to launch a "Japan-EU Competitiveness Alliance" to enhance their companies' competitiveness through trade and economic security cooperation. The alliance will focus on diversifying supply chains for rare earth minerals, aligning subsidy conditions for environmental technology, and promoting World Trade Organization reform.

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," who famously invested all their assets in bitcoin, have overhauled their security measures following a rise in kidnappings targeting crypto executives. They now use a hybrid system involving analog and digital methods, splitting their seed phrases into encrypted segments stored globally. The family has also abandoned hardware wallets due to security concerns and now relies on blockchain-based encryption and physical hiding places. The measures reflect growing concerns about physical attacks targeting crypto holders and the need for enhanced security protocols.</p>
