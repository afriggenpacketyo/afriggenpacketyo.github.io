          <p>Poland's presidential election is headed for a runoff between pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, supported by the centrist Civic Coalition, advocates for abortion rights and LGBTQ+ protections, while Nawrocki, backed by the conservative Law and Justice party, champions conservative values and national sovereignty. The election occurs amid political tension between the Polish prime minister and the outgoing president, and the outcome will significantly influence Poland's stance on key social issues and its relationship with the European Union.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies closer Jos√© Alvarado has been suspended for 80 games after testing positive for external testosterone, marking the second player suspended this year under MLB's drug-testing program. Alvarado, who will lose $4.5 million and be ineligible for the postseason, accepted the suspension without appeal. The team plans to explore closing options, while manager Rob Thomson expresses confidence in the team's ability to adapt. Phillies president Dave Dombrowski stated that the positive test was caused by a weight loss drug Alvarado took during the offseason.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have released Chris Taylor, their longest-tenured position player, to make room for Tommy Edman's return, signaling a shift towards younger talent. Taylor, once a key player in the team's success, struggled to maintain his performance after elbow surgery in 2021. The emergence of rookie utilityman Hyeseong Kim, combined with Taylor's declining production, made the veteran expendable. The move marks the departure of another familiar face from the Dodgers' clubhouse.</p>
