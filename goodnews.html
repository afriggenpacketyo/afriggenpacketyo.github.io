          <p>Scotland's momentum in the Women's Rugby World Cup was halted by a strong Canadian team, resulting in a defeat that places Canada at the top of Pool B. Despite an early try from Scotland's Rhona Lloyd and a second-half score by Evie Gallagher, Canada's power and clinical execution proved decisive. The Canadian team secured their victory with multiple tries, including two from hooker Emily Tuttosi. This result means Scotland is now on a course to face the formidable host nation, England, in the quarter-finals of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has officially begun the process of establishing his presidential library, selecting his home state of Delaware as the location. A 13-person board, including former top aides and prominent Democratic fundraisers, has been appointed to lead the significant fundraising effort required for the project. The team faces the challenge of securing donations in a divided political climate, with costs for such institutions often running into hundreds of millions of dollars. The library is envisioned to be a museum and a center for civic engagement, leadership, and policy.</p>

          <p>A remotely operated vehicle (ROV) provided a rare live-streamed tour of the bottom of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the United States, reaching depths of over 1,500 feet. The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to raise awareness about the lake's unique ecosystem and the importance of conservation efforts. Experts discussed the lake's ancient origins, explaining how its floor functions like a lung, processing materials from the watershed. While the dive dispelled urban legends of preserved bodies, it highlighted the ongoing challenge of pollution, as past expeditions have discovered trash even in the deepest parts of the lake.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has presented a detailed plan to the company's board aimed at improving performance and accelerating growth. The proposal suggests refranchising the bottling network for PepsiCo's North American beverage business and divesting from underperforming brands to refocus on core products like Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues these strategic shifts, along with cost optimization in the Frito-Lay division, could unlock significant shareholder value and reverse years of stock underperformance. The plan emphasizes long-term reinvestment over short-term buybacks to revitalize the company's iconic brands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advocates for renting over homeownership, a decision she made after selling four properties she previously owned. She argues that renting provides greater financial flexibility and has allowed her to grow her net worth more rapidly by investing the proceeds from her home sales into index funds. Joy highlights the often-underestimated hidden costs of homeownership, such as maintenance, renovations, and property taxes, as well as the emotional and logistical burdens of being a landlord. For her, the ability to adapt her living situation to her current needs without being tied to a property has been key to her financial success.</p>

          <p>According to a Harvard-trained expert, highly successful people such as Taylor Swift commonly exhibit seven specific traits that contribute to their achievements. These characteristics include imagination, synthesis (the ability to connect new and old ideas), and intense focus on a core goal without dabbling in unimportant ventures. Other crucial traits are doggedness in the face of difficulty, sustained passion, reverence for their craft, and a deep commitment that involves forgoing other options. The article suggests that Swift's career demonstrates a mastery of these qualities, from her songwriting process to her unwavering dedication to music and performing.</p>

          <p>A newsletter from The Atlantic delves into the concept of 'not caring' as a form of liberation, particularly for women rejecting societal expectations. It highlights the viral 'We Do Not Care Club,' where women find freedom in saying no to pressures about their appearance and behavior. The article notes that while humans are wired to worry about others' opinions, these fears are often overblown, and letting go can lead to a more honest life. This form of indifference is not about apathy but about consciously choosing whose approval matters, which can be a quiet act of defiance against a world of external pressures.</p>

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unpublished jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré who documented the American jazz scene in the early 1950s. While famous for her street photography, Model embarked on a project to capture jazz musicians and their audiences, a venture that was ultimately derailed due to FBI suspicion of her leftist politics. Her images are noted for capturing a sense of wariness and inner turmoil in her subjects, including icons like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. The article suggests Model's shared experience of persecution may have allowed her to connect deeply with the artists, who faced racism and violence in the U.S. despite their fame.</p>

          <p>A mother's persistence after her one-year-old son, Jonny, experienced a relentless series of infections and ailments led to a harrowing diagnosis of malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer.

Despite the grim prognosis typically associated with the disease, Jonny's tumor had not spread, offering a rare glimmer of hope. Now two years old, he is in remission and undergoing careful surveillance, and his family is adjusting to a new normal after a traumatic year.</p>

          <p>Experts in dementia research are calling this 'a very exciting time' due to recent breakthroughs in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment. A major clinical trial, the U.S. POINTER Study, demonstrated that lifestyle interventions—including physical activity, a healthy diet, and brain exercises—can lead to cognitive improvement in at-risk individuals. Additionally, the FDA's recent approval of a new blood test offers a simpler, less invasive method for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers. These advances provide hope that it may be possible to delay or even prevent the progression of dementia through a combination of lifestyle changes and earlier medical intervention.</p>

          <p>As the price of gold continues to hit new records, climbing about 35% this year to nearly $3,600 an ounce, financial experts are advising on the best ways for investors to gain exposure. Gold is seen as a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty and low interest rates, with central bank purchases also driving demand. Most experts recommend investing through liquid, low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than buying physical bullion. Financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

An expert on the musical notes that its legacy is deeply intertwined with the Obama era, initially representing a hopeful vision of an inclusive America. However, in the current political climate, the show's second act, which depicts political polarization and collapse, feels more resonant. While the musical once united figures across the political spectrum, it later became a symbol of counter-Trump sentiment, and critiques of its progressive portrayal of the Founding Fathers have become more widespread.</p>
