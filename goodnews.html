          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in talks with Rwanda to establish an agreement for Kigali to accept deportees from the U.S., including Africans and other non-Rwandan nationals. Decisions on financial compensation and other details are expected within two weeks, according to a Rwandan official. The U.S. is simultaneously trying to broker a peace agreement between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Secretary of State Marco Rubio praised Trump's envoy to Africa, Massad Boulos, for his efforts to broker billion-dollar minerals deals in the region.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is launching a startup called World that uses a device called an Orb to scan a person's retina and verify they are human, creating a digital ID to distinguish them from bots. The Orb is intended to address the issue of bots impersonating people in areas like finance and online dating. The U.S. rollout follows an international debut in 2023 that faced privacy backlash, including government shutdowns in Kenya, Hong Kong, and Spain. The Orb is designed to be used in the World App, a digital wallet for decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies, with expectations of looser crypto regulations under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his first judicial nominee of his second term, Whitney Hermandorfer, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, signaling a continuation of his focus on appointing conservative judges. The article praises Trump's previous judicial appointments, including Justices Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett, and their impact on decisions such as overturning Roe v. Wade and strengthening the Second Amendment. The author anticipates Trump will look beyond traditional Federalist Society choices to install a new generation of judicial titans. Trump's judicial impact extended beyond the Supreme Court, as he appointed 54 circuit judges in his first term, second only to President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs 56 in a single term.</p>

          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" explores the complexities of adolescence and relationships on the French Riviera. The film follows C√©cile, a young girl enjoying a carefree summer with her father and his girlfriend, until the arrival of Anne, a friend of C√©cile's deceased mother, disrupts their dynamic. While the movie captures the glamour of the setting, it delves deeper into the characters' motivations, sometimes over-intellectualizing the narrative. Chlo√´ Sevigny's portrayal of Anne stands out, embodying emotional vulnerability beneath a composed exterior.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is considering plans for a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially involving 6,600 soldiers, tanks, and aerial displays. The proposed parade on June 14 would coincide with the Army's 250th celebration and President Trump's 79th birthday. The timing and White House involvement have led to speculation that Trump is seeking a grand military parade, similar to one that was previously canceled due to high costs. City officials have expressed concerns about potential damage to infrastructure from heavy vehicles.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese bargain retailer, has stopped shipping products directly from China to the U.S. as a result of the Trump administration's decision to end the de minimis tariff loophole. The change requires Temu to rely on U.S.-based warehouses and sellers to circumvent higher levies. Shoppers previously faced import charges of 130% to 150% on products shipped from China. The company said pricing for U.S. shoppers ‚Äúremains unchanged as the platform transitions to a local fulfillment model.‚Äù (not investment advice)</p>

Temu said it would adjust its prices after Trump announced his intention to close the loophole, and has been actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>
