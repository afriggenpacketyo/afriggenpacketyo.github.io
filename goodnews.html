          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. This attack was a response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, but the lack of casualties eased investor concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil futures fell by over 7%, while global benchmark Brent also saw a substantial decrease, reflecting optimism that tensions might de-escalate. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Trump's foreign policy for fostering a more stable global environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Meta disputed the CAO's characterization, emphasizing WhatsApp's encrypted nature and its higher level of security compared to other approved apps.

          <p>Novo Nordisk has ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health, alleging the telehealth company engaged in "deceptive marketing" practices and sold illegitimate versions of Wegovy, its weight-loss drug.

Hims & Hers' shares plummeted following the announcement, as the company anticipated significant revenue from weight-loss services. Novo Nordisk stated it aims to ensure patient safety and will continue selling Wegovy through other telehealth platforms committed to these standards, following FDA scrutiny of compounded weight-loss drugs.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a potential issue with the door latches that could trap passengers inside. The recall affects model years 2021-2025, as the door latches may remain locked if the car's battery level drops too low, posing a risk to children and others unable to unlock the doors. Ford plans to issue a software update to address the problem and will notify owners of the safety risk. This recall follows a previous recall in May for over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a rearview camera software glitch.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the oil and gas industry and their impact on energy prices. Although oil prices initially surged, they later retreated as experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil transit route. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, with potential Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities posing a significant risk. Analysts suggest that a closure of the Strait of Hormuz could send prices soaring, potentially reaching $130 per barrel, while U.S. gas prices are expected to rise in the short term.

          <p>With summer 2025 bringing potential for increased expenses, homeowners are considering using home equity loans. Understanding the difference between a home equity loan and a HELOC (home equity line of credit) is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Shopping around for the best rates and terms is also important, as is using the equity for financially sound purposes such as paying off high-interest debt rather than discretionary spending. Strategically using home equity can improve financial standing.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock has underperformed compared to other major tech stocks during a volatile year, trading below both its 50- and 200-day moving averages. While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple has struggled, raising questions about its role as a market safe haven. Investors are diversifying into broader market funds and traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Despite this, some analysts remain bullish on tech, viewing market volatility as a buying opportunity, particularly in the AI and chip sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent debates on social media revolve around the portrayal of women, particularly those perceived as appealing to men or being "male-centered." Terms like "pick-me" and "not a girl's girl" are used to critique women deemed to be prioritizing male attention. Concerns are also raised about conservative propaganda aimed at women and the potential for harmful gender norms to be perpetuated online. These conversations reflect broader anxieties about gender, power, and the influence of social media on young women.</p>
