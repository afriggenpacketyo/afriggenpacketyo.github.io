          <p>Aviation company Joby and defense contractor L3Harris have announced a partnership to create a new hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft for military use. This craft is designed to be versatile, capable of being operated by a pilot or flying autonomously for missions like surveillance and logistics. The companies plan to leverage Joby's commercial air taxi technology with L3Harris's expertise in military systems, aiming for operational demonstrations by 2026. The project reflects a military shift towards smaller, more adaptable, and cost-effective autonomous aviation solutions.</p>

          <p>Paula Deen has announced the sudden and permanent closure of her flagship Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, which was instrumental in her rise to fame. The celebrity chef and her sons made the decision to also close a second eatery in the city, The Chicken Box, without providing a specific reason. The restaurant had been a popular tourist destination for decades, known for its indulgent Southern buffet. Deen's four other restaurants in different states will remain open, but the closure marks the end of an era for her culinary empire in its hometown.</p>

          <p>In a highly unusual event, infielder José Caballero was traded from the Tampa Bay Rays to the New York Yankees in the middle of a game between the two teams. Caballero began the game playing for the Rays, even recording a pop-out in the sixth inning, before being informed of the trade. He was seen saying goodbye to his stunned Rays teammates in the dugout during the seventh inning. After the Yankees' 7-4 victory, Caballero joked, "I was winning today regardless." The bizarre mid-game transaction highlights the intense nature of the MLB trade deadline.</p>

          <p>The new documentary "Folktales," from filmmakers Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, follows a group of Scandinavian teenagers attending a remote folk school in Norway. The school's curriculum focuses on building character and self-reliance through outdoor survival skills, particularly dog-sledding. The article reviews the film as a handsomely photographed and empathetic look at how teens connect with nature and the huskies they care for to overcome personal anxieties. While considered more of a heartwarming spotlight than a deep probe, the film effectively sells its message about the healing power of nature.</p>

          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve holding its benchmark interest rate steady, credit card debt forgiveness is still a worthwhile option for consumers with high balances. The article argues that the Fed's pause has not led to significant relief, as average credit card APRs remain near record highs of 22%. With total U.S. credit card debt surpassing a record $1.18 trillion, waiting for potential future rate cuts is unlikely to solve the problem for those struggling. Debt forgiveness, which can reduce the principal amount owed, offers a more immediate path to relief for those at risk of default. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has unanimously advanced a major bipartisan housing bill, the "ROAD to Housing Act of 2025," designed to increase the supply of affordable housing. The legislation includes provisions to help renters and homebuyers by simplifying the construction of manufactured homes, expanding financing options, and improving federal housing programs. A key feature is the permanent authorization of a HUD disaster recovery program that helps communities rebuild after natural disasters. While not seen as a complete solution, the bill represents a significant bipartisan effort to address the nation's housing crisis.</p>

          <p>As more nations move to recognize Palestine, the article explores the complex criteria that define a state in international law. According to the 1933 Montevideo Convention, a state requires a defined territory, a permanent population, a government, and the capacity to enter into international relations. However, recognition by other states and membership in the United Nations are crucial for a state to function effectively on the global stage. The process for UN membership is fraught with political hurdles, particularly the veto power of the five permanent Security Council members, explaining why widely recognized entities like Palestine remain non-member observers.</p>
