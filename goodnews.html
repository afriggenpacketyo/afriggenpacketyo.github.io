        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hummingbird feeders, while intended to help these tiny birds, can become deadly traps if not regularly cleaned. Sugar water left out too long spoils, attracting harmful microbes that can cause infections in hummingbirds, such as candida, which causes their tongues to swell and makes it difficult to eat. Wildlife rehabbers emphasize the importance of cleaning feeders every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily in the summer. The solution involves mixing one part refined white sugar with four parts water, avoiding other sugars, sweeteners, and red food coloring, and regularly cleaning the feeder with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture to prevent mold growth.</p>

          <p>TalkTV host David Bull has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after a disagreement over calls for a burka ban. Bull, a long-time ally of Nigel Farage, will focus on providing leadership to activists rather than administrative tasks. Yusuf will now lead the party's "Doge team," aiming to cut wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils, while Reform UK is splitting Yusuf's former role into multiple positions, including a head of operations and head of treasury, with further leadership changes expected in the coming weeks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband defended the government's decision to partially reinstate winter fuel payments for pensioners, reversing an earlier cut. The Chancellor initially withdrew the payment from over 10 million pensioners to stabilize the economy but later expanded eligibility due to public pressure. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government maintains that the change will not lead to additional borrowing due to an improving economy, though the Conservatives have criticized the move, questioning its funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gen Z has shown a recent trend of returning to religion, reversing previous declines in religious attendance. Experts suggest this may be a form of rebellion against atheist parents or a search for community and answers in a turbulent world. While women have historically been more religious, Catholicism is seeing a rise in young men, potentially due to politics and a desire for a privileged position. This shift marks a significant change in the religious landscape and challenges previous assumptions about the decline of religion among young people.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling parties have agreed to include cash handouts for households affected by rising prices in their platforms for the upcoming House of Councillors election. This move contrasts with the opposition party's proposal to suspend the consumption tax on food. The ruling coalition aims to secure a majority in the upper house, and while the cash handout program is intended to support citizens, it may face criticism for appearing to boost public support ahead of the election. The details of the handout scheme, including the payment amount and distribution method, are yet to be finalized.</p>
