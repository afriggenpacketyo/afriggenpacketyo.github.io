          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profits but cautioned that ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China could negatively impact global container market volumes. The company's underlying EBITDA increased by 70% compared to the previous year, reaching $2.71 billion. However, Maersk revised its 2025 global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4%, citing increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. This adjustment reflects concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese products and subsequent retaliatory measures from Beijing on U.S. goods.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, a move aimed at calming investors concerned about global tariffs. The agreement, details of which are still emerging, could involve the UK lowering tariffs on US cars and cutting digital sales tax affecting US tech companies. This development follows the UK's recent free trade agreement with India, signaling a broader effort to expand global trade ties post-Brexit. The US remains the UK's top trading partner, purchasing close to ¬£200 billion in British exports.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has spent months nurturing his relationship with President Trump, which has culminated in an imminent trade agreement with the United States. This deal is a much-needed political victory, as well as vindication of his strategy of assiduously cultivating President Trump. The details of the agreement were not yet clear and could prove contentious with farmers and other interest groups in Britain. Britain, even under a center-left Labour government, has escaped the harsh criticism that Mr. Trump has trained on the European Union and China, both of which he accuses of ‚Äúripping off‚Äù the United States in their trade relationships.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million units for its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, with the device set to launch in June. The company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 24.7%, and profit plunged nearly 50% year-on-year, as consumers await the new console. Nintendo's forecasts are based on U.S. tariff rates effective April 10, with potential duties of 46% on consoles manufactured in Vietnam. President Shuntaro Furukawa noted that additional tariffs could decrease demand in the U.S., potentially impacting profits by tens of billions of yen.</p>

          <p>The UK's expected trade deal with the US is being hailed as a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer, especially following a difficult set of local election results for the Labour party. The agreement follows closely on the heels of a free trade agreement between the UK and India. While President Trump alluded to the agreement on social media, details remain limited, with expectations pointing towards a more specific deal to reduce tariffs on certain goods rather than a comprehensive free trade agreement. Shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith welcomed the deal as a "Brexit benefit" but emphasized the need to reverse Labour's policies that negatively impact businesses.</p>

Power was restored to Heathrow's terminals seven hours before flights resumed, but the root cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p>
