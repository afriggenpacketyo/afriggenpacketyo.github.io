          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, claims to have broken the world record for running across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. Goodge began his run from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finished at Bondi Beach in Sydney, running approximately 100km daily to raise money for cancer charities. Along the way, he faced challenges such as a dust storm, injuries, and hallucinations, dedicating his run to his mother who died from cancer in 2018. While Guinness World Records has yet to verify the record, Goodge stands by his data tracking amid some questions regarding his speed and heart rate data.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is facing pressure to dismiss farm minister Taku Eto after his insensitive remarks about receiving plenty of rice from supporters and not needing to buy any, amidst rising rice prices.

Despite apologizing and retracting the comments, Ishiba has defended Eto, stating that he should focus on addressing the challenges in the agricultural sector. The controversy comes at a sensitive time as the ruling coalition considers measures to mitigate inflation ahead of the House of Councillors election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly adopting AI to address a labor shortage and boost production, despite copyright concerns among artists. Japan's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI tools without consent, aiming to attract AI investors. While artists worry about job losses, studios like K&K Design are using AI to streamline tasks like coloring and background generation, significantly reducing production time. This integration of AI is also influenced by Japan's cultural acceptance of technology and the need to maintain its global anime market amid challenging working conditions for animators.</p>

Cohen's intelligence work in Syria during the early 1960s is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli War of 1967, though the recovered documents do not reveal the location of his remains, which Israel has long sought to retrieve.</p>

This fluctuation in performance was evident between races in Miami and Imola, where different track layouts favored different car strengths.

          <p>The Japanese government is initiating offshore "blue carbon" research to capture and store carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants in the deep sea. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. This initiative aims to enhance carbon capture efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, leveraging the ability of coastal plants like mangroves and kelp to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation.</p>

          <p>Honda Motor Co. has announced a 30% reduction in its electric vehicle (EV) technology investment plan through fiscal 2030, decreasing the investment from 10 trillion yen to approximately 7 trillion yen.

Honda now projects that EV sales will account for around 20% of total sales in 2030, down from the previously estimated 30%, though they maintain their long-term goal of 100% electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2040.</p>
