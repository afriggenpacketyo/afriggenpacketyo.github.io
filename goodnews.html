          <p>President Trump, addressing reporters on Air Force One, discussed judicial nominations and immigration policies, asserting the need for judges who won't demand trials for every illegal immigrant. He claimed his immigration overhaul was his top campaign issue, blaming judges for delays and warning of dire consequences if the Supreme Court doesn't support his policies. Trump also mentioned meetings with various countries, including China, regarding trade deals, hinting at potential announcements but providing no specifics. This comes amid ongoing trade disputes and tariffs imposed on several nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, citing a "National Security threat" due to other countries offering incentives to attract filmmakers. The move aims to revitalize the American movie industry but details remain unclear regarding its application to American production companies filming abroad or films on streaming services. Australia and New Zealand have voiced support for their film industries, while Trump has signaled a willingness to lower tariffs on China and potentially extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok's US operations.

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, not red. The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of Rosa most likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are among the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world, and this research provides insights into their evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that China is rapidly catching up to and, in some areas, surpassing the United States in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence. The authors highlight China's swift development of competitive AI models, its open-source approach, and its dominance in manufacturing and STEM talent. They warn that China's growing influence in apps, AI companions, and autonomous agents could challenge U.S. dominance in the digital economy. The article urges the U.S. to openly share AI technologies, innovate faster, and accelerate AI diffusion throughout its economy to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking fell to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast with sharp increases in previous years when development projects resumed after COVID-19 suspensions. Despite the decline, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool amid China's growing influence.</p>
