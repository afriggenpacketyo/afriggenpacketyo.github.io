          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, invite-only launch for its robotaxi service in Austin, which has garnered a range of reactions from participants and analysts. While some, like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, praised the event as a major success with impressive maneuverability, others pointed to significant flaws. Incidents included a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping abruptly in traffic. The launch highlights the ongoing debate over Tesla's camera-only approach to autonomy, which contrasts with competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar technology.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have confirmed an agreement to accelerate the shipment of rare earth minerals to the U.S., marking a step toward de-escalating their ongoing trade war. The deal, which builds on a previous consensus reached in Geneva, involves China reviewing and approving export permits while the U.S. eases some of its restrictive countermeasures. This development aims to stabilize a fraught economic relationship and alleviate supply chain disruptions, particularly for industries reliant on these critical minerals. However, the long-term resolution of the broader trade dispute remains uncertain.</p>

The potential move is fueled by speculation over Red Bull's declining performance and their development progress on the new 2026 engines compared to Mercedes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are divided on the wisdom of buying whole life insurance for children as a financial planning tool for families. Proponents argue that it locks in lifelong insurability at a low premium, which can be beneficial if the child later develops health issues, and provides a death benefit for final expenses. However, critics contend that the coverage is often statistically unnecessary for a child and that the policy's cash value component offers a poor return compared to other investment vehicles. Alternatives like 529 plans or brokerage accounts are often recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers can secure significant returns by investing in long-term certificates of deposit (CDs).

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered a "genetic switch" that could potentially allow mammals, including humans, to regenerate damaged tissue. Their research, published in the journal Science, found that a mouse's inability to regenerate ear tissue was due to insufficient production of retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue repair. By reactivating a specific gene responsible for producing this acid, the scientists successfully enabled regeneration in the mouse. This breakthrough could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in vertebrates.</p>
