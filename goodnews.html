        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from reducing the Department of Education's workforce by half and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge, a Biden appointee, sided with a group of state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits who argued that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress. The Trump administration argued that the changes would make the department more efficient, but the judge determined their true intention was to dismantle the department without legal authorization. The ruling underscores the legal challenges to the Trump administration's policies and its efforts to reshape federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Existing home sales in April declined by 0.5% from March, reaching the slowest pace for that month since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 2% from April of the previous year, falling short of economists' expectations for a gain. High interest rates and low consumer confidence continue to challenge the spring housing market, but any decline in mortgage rates could help release pent-up housing demand. Inventory jumped 9% month-to-month and was nearly 21% higher than the previous April, leading to a slight cooling in prices and more negotiation power for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue the manufacturing of pennies due to the rising cost of production, which currently exceeds the coin's value. The U.S. Mint is expected to exhaust its final order of penny blanks by early 2026, resulting in approximately $56 million in annual savings. Pennies, primarily made of zinc with a copper overlay, have become increasingly expensive to produce as zinc costs have more than doubled since 2000. The Trump administration had previously signaled its intention to halt penny production, citing the financial inefficiency of minting coins that cost more to produce than their face value.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court announced a 4-4 split decision in Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond, effectively blocking the establishment of the nation's first religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself, leading to the tie. The decision upholds an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling that prohibits the state from funding a Catholic charter school, meaning public schools in Oklahoma will remain secular. It remains unclear whether this regime will last, as proponents of religious charter schools may attempt to create such a school again in a way that does not cause Justice Barrett to recuse herself.</p>
