          <p>President Trump announced he is extending the deadline for 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9 after a phone call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

          <p>Wendy Cutler, Vice President of the Asia Society Policy Institute, offers insights on the US-China trade relationship. She believes the tariff truce, which exceeded expectations, was needed because tariffs were negatively impacting both economies. She notes that 90 days is a short window to resolve outstanding issues, so we should expect ups and downs in bilateral relations. Progress is being made on fentanyl, but excess capacity, subsidies and transshipments will be challenging to find common ground on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, emotionally safe parenting is the best approach to raising highly successful children. This involves being attuned to a child's emotional needs, building emotional resilience, and fostering trust through open communication. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view misbehavior as stress signals, take responsibility after conflicts, and create an environment where their child feels safe expressing themselves.</p>
