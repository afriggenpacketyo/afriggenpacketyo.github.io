          <p>Thousands of chicks, abandoned in a USPS truck for three days, have been adopted by local families, rescues, and farms. The chicks were part of a 12,000-bird shipment left unattended, resulting in the deaths of thousands due to high temperatures and lack of hydration. The surviving birds were cared for by the First State Animal Center and SPCA, which ensured they would live out their natural lives.

          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the previous quarter, according to the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis). This growth is attributed to a surge in exports ahead of US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. Meanwhile, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in three foreign missions. This economic growth provides a positive outlook amidst global trade tensions and ongoing discussions about international security.</p>

          <p>Apple has increased trade-in values for iPhones in China to stimulate demand in a crucial market facing growing competition. The iPhone 15 Pro Max now has a trade-in value of up to 5,700 Chinese yuan, signaling Apple's desire to boost sales. This move comes as Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year in the first quarter, with local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei gaining ground.

          <p>Energy bills in the UK will decrease by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year, according to energy regulator Ofgem. This translates to an annual bill reduction of ¬£129 for a typical household, reflecting a fall in international wholesale gas prices. However, charities emphasize that many people still struggle to pay, with customer debt to suppliers totaling around ¬£4 billion. The price cap changes every three months, and analysts expect little change in prices come October, underscoring the ongoing challenges of energy affordability for many households.</p>

The US Treasury anticipates annual savings of $56 million in reduced material costs once penny production ceases. Made primarily from zinc with a copper coating, the penny costs more to produce than its face value, prompting the decision to discontinue its minting. Advocates for the move cite high production costs and limited utility, while others point to its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production compared to the nickel.</p>

The call, requested by the U.S. side, came ahead of another round of ministerial tariff talks in Washington on Friday.
