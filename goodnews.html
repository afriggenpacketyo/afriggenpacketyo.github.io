          <p>Jon Jones, a prominent figure in mixed martial arts, has announced his retirement from the UFC, leading to Tom Aspinall's promotion to undisputed heavyweight champion. Jones, who holds a 28-1 record, captured UFC titles at light heavyweight and heavyweight. Aspinall, who became the interim heavyweight champion in November 2023 due to Jones' injury, expressed his enthusiasm for an active reign. Jones cited fighting being in his blood as a reason for never wanting to say he retired, but the news is now official.</p>

          <p>As the use of artificial intelligence grows rapidly, concerns are rising about potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. Researchers emphasize the need for more regulations and thorough testing of AI models to address these issues. Red teaming, involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is suggested as a valuable evaluation method. Experts suggest opening the testing to third parties such as normal users, journalists, researchers, and ethical hackers would lead to a more robust evaluation, and adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives are recommended to ensure better understanding and management of AI risks.</p>

          <p>The number of Turkish citizens becoming German citizens has doubled, driven by political repression and economic challenges in Turkey. Germany's citizenship reforms, including dual citizenship, have made it more attractive for Turks to seek German passports. Despite integration, many Turks maintain strong ties to their culture and homeland, but face everyday discrimination in Germany. While they may not feel entirely German, they seek the practical benefits and political voice that German citizenship offers.</p>

Despite home runs from Andy Pages, Will Smith, and Teoscar Hern√°ndez, the Dodgers couldn't keep pace with the Nationals' offensive power. Freddie Freeman, currently in a slump, acknowledged his struggles at the plate. Climate change may contribute to more home runs due to warmer temperatures and lower humidity in Los Angeles, according to research.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stage. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess a person's risk for up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine. Tests were able to detect changes in pre-malignant cells among residents of Hokkaido towns in northern Japan.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing striking parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in this single-celled eukaryote, which is a model organism for studying molecular life mechanisms. The team reorganized it into four distinct yet interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. This mirrors the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine.</p>
