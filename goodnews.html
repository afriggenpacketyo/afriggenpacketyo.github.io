          <p>Nissan is considering sharing its global plants with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as part of a business shake-up. The struggling company, which has announced significant layoffs and factory closures, is open to bringing Dongfeng into the Nissan production ecosystem globally.

          <p>Japan's economy contracted for the first time in a year, shrinking 0.2% in the March quarter due to a decline in exports. Uncertainties caused by U.S. trade policies affected Japan's export-heavy economy, but domestic demand showed some strength. Despite the contraction, Japan's GDP expanded year-on-year, marking the largest expansion since early 2023. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy rate, with some analysts anticipating a rate hike later in the year.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales, leading to entanglements with fishing ropes. Some fishermen are using high-tech systems like remote-controlled pop-up devices to minimize rope usage, but the cost poses a challenge for many. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the season to protect whales. One fisherman, Brand Little, is using the pop-up technology and has not injured a single humpback whale while doing so.</p>
