          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer manufacturing from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The move is expected to create 800 new American jobs in roles like engineering, R&D, and supply chain management. While the company states the reshoring aligns with its long-term strategy of producing goods closer to consumers, executives acknowledged that the tariffs were a key factor in speeding up the timeline for the transition. The new Kentucky plant is projected to be operational by early 2027.</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock reached an all-time high after the company announced it will offer tokenized shares of private firms OpenAI and SpaceX to its users in the European Union. This initiative, part of a broader expansion of its crypto services, marks the first time the platform has made equity in private companies accessible via blockchain technology. The move is possible due to the EU's more flexible regulatory environment, which lacks the "accredited investor" rules present in the U.S. While American users will not have access to these specific tokens, Robinhood did launch crypto staking for Ethereum and Solana in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to lift some U.S. financial sanctions against Syria, a move aimed at promoting stability following the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order terminates a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets but keeps other sanctions in place, including those targeting individuals like Assad and those mandated by Congress. The decision was anticipated after President Trump met with Syria's new leader, who argued that sanctions were hindering the transitional government's ability to function. The White House stated the move would help Syria's economic recovery while maintaining pressure on human rights abusers and terrorist-linked entities.</p>

          <p>Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, has applied for a national trust bank charter with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). If approved, Circle would establish the First National Digital Currency Bank, allowing it to operate under federal regulation and potentially offer custody services for digital assets to institutional clients. This strategic move follows a successful IPO and aligns with the company's goal of integrating stablecoins into the traditional financial system. Obtaining a federal charter would also help Circle comply with emerging U.S. regulations for stablecoins, such as the proposed GENIUS Act. (not investment advice)</p>

Last year, 10% of all new entrepreneurs identified as LGBTQ+, achieving representation on par with the general population for the first time. Many founders cite a desire to create inclusive spaces and be a positive influence in their communities as a primary motivation. Experts note the resilience of these businesses, which contribute an estimated $1.7 trillion to the U.S. economy, suggesting that entrepreneurship offers an alternative to potential discrimination in traditional workplaces.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee has removed a controversial provision from the Senate's budget bill that would have allowed for the sale of public lands in several Western states. Lee stated the withdrawal was due to an inability to secure guarantees that the land would be sold only to American families and not to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The proposal had faced significant opposition not only from Democrats but also from fellow Republicans in states like Idaho and Montana, as well as from conservation groups. The provision's removal marks a significant change to the bill as it moves through the complex budget reconciliation process.</p>

The decision was announced alongside the annual royal finances report, which revealed that a single two-day trip on the train cost over ¬£44,000. The Keeper of the Privy Purse described the move as part of a drive to ensure "value for money," though the Royal Family will continue to use regular train services and helicopters for travel. Before its decommissioning, the train will undertake a final tour of the UK and may be put on public display.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has announced its largest-ever national healthcare fraud takedown, involving nearly 200 federal cases with intended losses of $14.6 billion. A central case involves charges against a Pakistani national who allegedly orchestrated a $650 million scheme targeting an Arizona Medicaid program for Native Americans. The scheme involved billing for substance abuse services that were never provided or were medically unnecessary, often recruiting patients from homeless shelters and reservations. This nationwide enforcement action highlights the vast scale of fraud within the U.S. healthcare system, which officials estimate costs taxpayers hundreds of billions annually.</p>
