          <p>Susan Dominus, after studying parents of highly successful children for ten years, highlights five key practices. These parents foster optimism, tailoring their motivational approach to each child's interests, and understand that learning happens everywhere, not just in formal settings. They also prioritize a genuine love for knowledge over mere hard work and motivate their children with love rather than criticism. The author emphasizes that exposing children to opportunities, knowing them well enough to motivate them with love, and allowing their own desires to drive them are crucial for their growth.</p>

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from the England squad for their upcoming match against Andorra, with coach Thomas Tuchel expected to experiment with the starting lineup. Tuchel is reportedly considering deploying Chelsea right-back Reece James in an unfamiliar left-back position, while Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones is being considered on the right side of defense. The head coach revealed that Saka had only completed one full training session during the week, suggesting his omission is linked to fitness concerns, and it remains uncertain whether he will participate in the friendly against Senegal.</p>

          <p>Japan and the European Union are preparing to launch a "competitive alliance" to enhance their companies' competitiveness through trade and economic security cooperation. The initiative, expected to be announced at a summit meeting in July, aims to counter concerns over U.S. tariffs and Chinese trade practices. The alliance will focus on diversifying supply chains for rare earth minerals, aligning subsidy conditions for environmental technology, and promoting reform of the World Trade Organization.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has pioneered the use of drones in unprecedented ways, consistently surprising Russia with innovative attack strategies. From sea drones that have pushed Russian warships away from Ukraine's Black Sea coast to stealthy drone attacks on Russian air bases, Ukraine's creative drone warfare is proving to be a significant force multiplier. While Russia is rapidly increasing its drone production, Ukraine's continued innovation and adaptation in drone technology are playing a critical role in limiting Russia's battlefield advantages and inflicting heavy casualties.</p>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all possessions in 2017 to invest in Bitcoin, has overhauled its security after a wave of crypto executive kidnappings. They now use a hybrid system with seed phrases encrypted, split, and stored via blockchain or hidden across four continents. Didi Taihuttu, the family patriarch, stated that this system ensures that even under duress, he cannot provide access to significant funds, and the family has stopped posting travel updates and filming at home after receiving disturbing messages from strangers.</p>
