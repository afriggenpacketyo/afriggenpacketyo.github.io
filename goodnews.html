          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the US focused on Mars, the Soviets achieved several milestones with the Venera program, including the first probes to enter another planet's atmosphere and transmit data from its surface. The re-entry highlights the legacy of space exploration and the numerous objects still orbiting Earth, sometimes unexpectedly returning to the planet.</p>

          <p>A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee was felt across several southern states, including Georgia and North Carolina, causing homes to shake and waking residents. No major damage or injuries were immediately reported, although the USGS received thousands of reports from the public. The earthquake occurred in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, an area with a history of seismic activity, and there is a small chance of aftershocks. Experts remind residents of the importance of knowing what to do during an earthquake, such as dropping, covering, and holding on, and staying clear of buildings if outside.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller discusses the importance of instinct over data in decision-making, emphasizing that predicting the public's appetite is impossible. He recounts his experiences at ABC, where he championed made-for-TV movies, trusting his gut to identify compelling stories. Diller stresses that while data can provide historical context, it often hinders creative and business decisions by narrowing the scope of understanding. He shares anecdotes about greenlighting successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker" based on their inherent appeal rather than extensive research.</p>
