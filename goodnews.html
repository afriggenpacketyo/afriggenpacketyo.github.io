          <h2>Japan's Gen Z Embraces 'Quiet Quitting' for Better Work-Life Balance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 08:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are 'quiet quitting,' prioritizing personal interests and work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. According to a study, nearly half of Japanese workers aged 20 to 59 admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, with those in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. This shift reflects a rejection of the intense work ethic of previous generations, who often sacrificed personal lives for their companies. Experts suggest this change is driven by a desire for more 'me time' and a recognition that companies no longer offer the same job security and benefits as before.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined as President Trump recommended a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S., leading investors to seek safety in bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 8 basis points to 4.988%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by 10 basis points to 4.457%. These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, influenced by concerns about Trump's budget bill worsening the U.S. deficit and Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating.</p>

          <p>OpenAI employees are reportedly frustrated by the company's restrictions on donating equity to charities, despite its soaring valuation. The company has allegedly deprioritized the issue, citing the need to manage its cap table effectively. Employees are missing out on potential tax benefits and the opportunity to significantly increase the value of their donations. While OpenAI has offered limited equity donation opportunities in the past, employees claim the timeline for future opportunities has been indefinitely pushed back, despite promises from executives.</p>

In 2019, Smollett claimed to be the victim of a racist and homophobic attack, but he was later charged with lying to police.

          <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told CNBC that meeting President Donald Trump's demand for NATO members to spend 5% of their GDP on defense would be challenging. Mitsotakis suggested that 3.5% of GDP is a more realistic ceiling for hard defense spending, though the 5% target could be attainable in the long term if broader security-related expenses are included. Many NATO countries have historically struggled to meet the current 2% target. NATO estimates suggest the U.S. spent around 3.4% of its GDP on defense in 2024.</p>

Ukrainian and Russian delegations met in Turkey last week for the first time since the early months of the war, but the talks produced few concrete results beyond a commitment to carry out a prisoner exchange.</p>
