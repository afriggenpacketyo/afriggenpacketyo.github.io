          <h2>England and India Set Up Thrilling Finish at Headingley</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 13:38:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first test between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion at Headingley after centuries from KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant put India in a strong position, only for Josh Tongue's late spell to keep England in contention. Rahul's classical 137 and Pant's entertaining 118 helped India reach 364, setting England a target of 371 to win, with England losing their last six wickets for just 31 runs. England survived six overs to close on 21-0, leaving all results possible on the final day with the pitch offering increasingly venomous bounce. The match is made more intriguing by a mixed weather forecast, and England's commitment to never playing for a draw means their approach on Tuesday will be an examination of their philosophy, which could lead to an exciting finish. The second batter to make hundreds in each innings on this ground, Pant became the second wicketkeeper to do so anywhere.</p>

          <p>Amazon successfully launched its second batch of Kuiper internet satellites into low Earth orbit, escalating its competition with SpaceX's Starlink. A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The mission was initially rescheduled twice due to unfavorable weather and a rocket booster issue. This launch represents a significant step in Amazon's plan to create a massive satellite constellation for providing internet connectivity. The company continues its new chapter in low Earth orbit satellite connectivity, as it competes in the space-based internet market.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has approved Omnicom's $13.5 billion acquisition of Interpublic, but with conditions to prevent the merged company from colluding to influence ad spending based on political content. The agreement allows individual advertisers to specify ad placements but prohibits agreements to steer ad dollars towards or away from publishers based on their political leanings. The FTC's decision also resolves potential claims related to alleged coordination with media watchdogs accused of orchestrating advertiser boycotts. The agency's chairman, Andrew Ferguson, emphasized the importance of protecting free speech rights while addressing concerns about potential collusion in the media-buying market. The settlement requires the company to provide related documents and file annual compliance reports for five years.</p>

          <p>On the 53rd anniversary of Title IX, SEC Linda McMahon and Payton McNabb advocate for protecting women's sports by ensuring fair and safe competition based on biological sex. They argue that allowing men in women's sports is unfair and potentially dangerous, citing injuries like those suffered by Payton McNabb from a volleyball spiked by a male athlete. The Trump administration has taken a firm stance against discrimination in sports, launching investigations into states allegedly violating Title IX by allowing men to compete in women's events. They emphasize that states risk losing federal funding if they fail to uphold equal opportunity protections based on biological sex. The authors believe that women deserve fair and safe competition, and their voices are being heard under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Apple's recent underperformance has raised questions about the tech sector's traditional role as a safe haven during market volatility. While the broader tech sector has rebounded strongly, Apple has traded below its 50- and 200-day moving averages, marking its worst relative performance against its sector fund since 2002. Investors are primarily buying the broad stock market on dips, which inherently includes a significant weighting in tech, with top tech stocks representing over 30% of the S&P 500. Despite concerns about valuation, some analysts view market volatility as a buying opportunity for tech stocks, particularly those involved in the AI revolution. Investors are becoming more accustomed to volatility and are diversifying their portfolios with traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. (not investment advice)</p>

Hochul described the plan as a critical energy initiative that would complement renewable energy construction and help advance New York's goal to achieve a clean energy economy. Renewable energy groups criticized the decision, arguing that the New York Power Authority should focus on building renewable energy sources instead.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When facing both medical and credit card debt, prioritizing credit card debt is generally advisable to protect your credit score and avoid compounding interest charges. Credit card activity is reported monthly, and high interest rates can quickly increase balances. Medical debt, on the other hand, often has a longer grace period before affecting credit scores and can be more negotiable. While both types of debt can end up in collections, credit card issuers tend to be more aggressive. Ultimately, the best approach is to proactively manage both types of debt by exploring payment assistance and negotiating payment plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu praised Wimbledon for preventing a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets to the championships. The All England Club's security measures identified the man, who had followed Raducanu to four tournaments in February, and blocked his attempt to enter the public ballot. The man was given a restraining order by Dubai police after Raducanu caught sight of him in the stands at the Dubai Tennis Championships. Raducanu expressed gratitude for the measures taken, acknowledging that stalking is an issue faced by many athletes and women in general.</p>
