          <p>American golfer Scottie Scheffler has won his first British Open, claiming the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush with a commanding four-stroke lead. The world's top-ranked player finished the tournament at 17-under-par, demonstrating remarkable consistency throughout the final round. This victory marks Scheffler's fourth major championship title and the third leg of the career Grand Slam, leaving only the U.S. Open to complete the prestigious set. His performance further solidifies his status as the most dominant force in men's golf, continuing an exceptional run of form over the past few seasons.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas Hill Country announced a significant positive development in the aftermath of deadly holiday weekend floods, reducing the number of missing people from over 100 to just three. This sharp drop comes after extensive verification efforts by local and state agencies, who confirmed many initially reported missing were safe. The historic flash floods had killed at least 135 people, with the Guadalupe River area in Kerr County being the hardest hit. While recovery efforts continue for the remaining missing individuals, the update brings a measure of relief to the devastated community as it begins to address the disaster's broader impact.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stay relevant and reflect modern interests, Girlguiding has unveiled 72 new badges, the second major update in the organization's 116-year history. The new awards were developed with input from over 20,000 girls and volunteers and cover a wide range of contemporary topics. Badges now available include "fandoms," for passions like Taylor Swift; "booktivist," for learning about empowerment through reading; and "bee rescuer" for environmental action. This overhaul aims to build girls' confidence and engage them with activities that resonate with their current lives, from engineering and codebreaking to folklore and upcycling.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent clashes of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which took place on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners at a coking plant in Rotherham, leaving over 100 injured. The inquiry comes after decades of campaigning by former miners and their families, who have long sought accountability for the events of that day and the subsequent failed prosecutions of 95 miners, which collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. The decision marks a landmark moment for those seeking justice and truth.</p>

          <p>The Mexican spirit mezcal is experiencing a global surge in popularity, emerging from the shadow of its cousin, tequila, to become a premium, sought-after liquor. This boom is transforming the lives of traditional, family-owned distilleries in Oaxaca, the heart of mezcal production. The article profiles fourth-generation mezcaleros who have preserved their artisanal, handcrafted methods for centuries and are now leading a half-billion-dollar industry. This growth has allowed families who once struggled in poverty to build successful international businesses, creating a modern "Mexican dream" while striving to maintain the spirit's authentic, cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A new AI-powered educational tool named Khanmigo, developed by Khan Academy, is being piloted in U.S. schools as both a personal tutor for students and an assistant for teachers. The platform is designed to guide students toward answers by asking questions rather than providing them directly, fostering critical thinking. For educators, it can generate detailed lesson plans in minutes and monitor student progress in real-time. A unique safety feature also flags conversations where students may be discussing self-harm or emotional distress, alerting school staff to intervene, which has already proven effective in at least one school district.</p>

          <p>Following his victory at The Open, Scottie Scheffler's sustained excellence is prompting comparisons to the peak dominance of Tiger Woods. His peers and commentators highlight his machine-like consistency and ability to win even when not at his absolute best, a trait famously associated with Woods. The article notes that Scheffler has now won four of the last fifteen major tournaments, a run of success unmatched since Woods's prime. While Scheffler himself dismisses the comparisons as premature, his performance statistics and the sense of inevitability surrounding his victories are making the parallels increasingly difficult to ignore within the sport.</p>

Better Angels is currently bidding on several large-scale projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing hundreds of units for homeless and low-income residents.

          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to serve as a single point of contact for consumer complaints against water companies. This new watchdog will have legal powers to address issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and poor service. The move is part of a wider overhaul of the water industry, which has faced intense public backlash over rising bills and a record number of sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as "broken" and has pledged to significantly reduce pollution spills, signaling major reforms are forthcoming for the industry and its regulator, Ofwat.</p>

          <p>In an interview on Face the Nation, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick vigorously defended the Trump administration's aggressive tariff strategy, stating Americans will "love the deals" it produces. He asserted that the tariffs have successfully brought countries to the negotiating table and that the U.S. will see a record number of favorable trade deals finalized soon. Lutnick dismissed concerns about rising consumer prices, arguing that the policy encourages domestic manufacturing and that any price resets will be minimal. He confirmed that an August 1st deadline for new tariff rates on the E.U. is firm, framing the policy as essential for fixing trade deficits. (not investment advice)</p>
