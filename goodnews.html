Katie Ledecky also secured another victory, maintaining her undefeated streak in the 800-meter freestyle, a record she has held since the 2012 Olympics. The wins, which also included a gold for Gretchen Walsh in the 50-meter butterfly, marked a significant turnaround for the team at the championships.

          <p>Celebrating its tenth anniversary, Ethereum has transformed from a radical experiment into a fundamental component of the global financial system, now valued at over $420 billion. Initially a bare-bones network, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and is increasingly integrated into Wall Street, with major institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank building on its platform. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the immense growth but warns against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption continues. The platform's stability and programmability are cited as key reasons for its adoption by traditional financial entities. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's ruling that officials must have reasonable suspicion before detaining individuals. The decision stems from sweeps conducted by the Trump administration that were found to have potentially relied on factors like race or speaking Spanish, which violates the Fourth Amendment. The Ninth Circuit panel agreed that these factors alone do not justify a stop. While advocates praised the ruling for protecting civil rights, the administration criticized the decision as judicial overreach undermining immigration enforcement efforts.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana are launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but have yet to decide on a name. The nascent party, which has reportedly attracted over 600,000 registered supporters, is inviting its followers to help choose a name that encapsulates its values. This unconventional approach aims to build a grassroots movement, but the party cannot field election candidates until it officially registers a name with the Electoral Commission. The process highlights the importance of branding in modern politics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have formally designated Luka Doncic as the franchise's future by signing him to a three-year, $165 million extension, a move underscored by a celebratory press conference. This commitment, however, intensifies questions about the role of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season. The article explores the potential for tension as the team's focus shifts from the 40-year-old superstar to the 26-year-old Doncic. While the team's general manager expressed hope that James would retire a Laker, his comments lacked certainty, suggesting an uneasy transition period.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key catalyst for his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a physician in 1988, felt unsuited for medicine and was deeply affected by his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement after a lifetime of work. He recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking bad news to patients and realized the profession was not his passion. This personal turning point led him to a successful and long-lasting career in entertainment.</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms is signaling a more cautious approach to its open-source artificial intelligence strategy, a shift that contrasts with China's rapid development in the open-source AI space. While Meta's Llama models have been influential, Chinese companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are quickly releasing advanced open-source models, creating a highly competitive ecosystem. AI expert Andrew Ng suggests this "Darwinian" competition could be China's path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development.

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved by researchers. The platypus, named Winston, died en route from Australia to the UK in 1943, with rumors attributing its death to shock from a nearby German U-boat attack. However, archival research by Australian academics has revealed a more mundane cause: the creature likely died from heatstroke. Logbooks from the ship showed that water and air temperatures climbed well above the safe threshold for the species as the vessel crossed the equator.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell made a sharp return from the injured list, but the team lost 4-0 to the Tampa Bay Rays. In his first start in nearly four months, the two-time Cy Young winner recorded eight strikeouts over five innings, showing flashes of his ace potential. However, he surrendered two home runs to Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, both of which took advantage of the short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's strong performance was seen as a promising sign for the Dodgers' postseason rotation.</p>
