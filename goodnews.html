          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Qamzova, a painkiller invented in China, as a non-opioid alternative. Developed by Delova, Qamzova is a long-acting injectable analgesic providing 24-hour pain relief with a single daily injection. Clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. The drug is intended to mitigate the U.S. overdose epidemic fueled by addictive opioids like fentanyl. Qamzova's approval marks a significant step for China's pharmaceutical industry and offers healthcare professionals a new tool to manage pain and reduce opioid dependency risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed that the energy price cap will fall in July, reducing the typical gas and electricity bill by ¬£11 a month. Despite this decrease, Ofgem is encouraging households to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate energy deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually. The price cap affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. While the price cap is decreasing, fixed deals may offer better value and certainty over monthly payments. Dame Clare Moriarty of Citizens Advice emphasizes that many households are still struggling with energy debt, and targeted support is needed for those hardest hit.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has announced it will call on the United States to mitigate the potential impact on Japanese students enrolled at Harvard University, following the Trump administration's decision to revoke the institution's certification to accept international students.

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after receiving a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems inadequate. The BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago, accounting for inflation. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) is likely to dispute the government if it doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defends the offers, stating they are above inflation. The BMA will ballot members next week regarding possible strike action.</p>

The measures targeted malware variants such as Bumblebee, Lactrodectus, Qakbot, DanaBot, HijackLoader, Trickbot, and WarmCookie.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that upcoming talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in June will be a significant milestone in bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba aims to secure the complete removal of higher U.S. tariffs, rejecting any partial reductions. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will continue ministerial talks in Washington, urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy. Trump has put part of a 24 percent 'reciprocal' tariff on Japanese products on hold, but a baseline of 10 percent remains. Ishiba also addressed plans to tackle surging rice prices, aiming for a price target that satisfies both producers and consumers.</p>
