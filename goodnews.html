          <h2>Parenting Expert Recommends Teaching Children Self-Connection as a Crucial Life Skill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:05:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child psychology expert, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that self-connection is the most vital skill for a child's success. This skill, which involves understanding one's own emotions and needs, fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests practical parenting shifts, such as validating feelings instead of dismissing them and allowing children age-appropriate autonomy to build their inner voice. These small changes can help prevent anxiety and insecurity in adulthood by reinforcing a child's sense of self-worth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and pollution. This initiative is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and sewage discharges into waterways. Environment Secretary Steve Reed described the sector as 'broken' and has set a target to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will have legal powers to protect customers in disputes with water companies, bringing the sector in line with other utilities.</p>

          <p>Following Scottie Scheffler's commanding four-shot victory at the Open Championship, fellow golfers have begun comparing his sustained dominance to that of Tiger Woods. This was Scheffler's fourth major title in three years, a run that players like Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy described as incredibly impressive and historically significant. Colleagues noted that Scheffler's unassuming demeanor and less-than-perfect-looking swing may have masked his true level of dominance. However, his consistent execution and ability to win decisively have solidified his position as the undisputed top player in the game.</p>
