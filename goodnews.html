          <h2>California Bill Proposes Misdemeanor for Officers Covering Faces on Duty</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:50:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill proposed in California would make it a misdemeanor for local, state, and federal law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust in law enforcement by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name. Democratic state senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin argue that the proposal is necessary due to an increase in federal officers conducting raids while covering their faces and badges. The bill would exempt the National Guard, SWAT teams, and officers responding to natural disasters, focusing on accountability and preventing vigilante-style actions.</p>
