          <p>Two men, Adam Carruthers and Daniel Graham, were found guilty of criminal damage for cutting down the famous Sycamore Gap tree in northern England, a crime that sparked widespread sadness and anger. The tree, a beloved symbol of the area, stood for 150 years along Hadrian‚Äôs Wall and was featured in the film ‚ÄúRobin Hood: Prince of Thieves‚Äù. Evidence suggested the motive was simply vandalism and a desire to create a spectacle, with cellphone data placing both men at the scene. Despite their denials, the jury delivered a unanimous verdict, and the men will be sentenced in July, facing up to 10 years in prison, while sprouts have already been spotted at the base of the stump, offering hope for its regeneration.</p>

          <p>Tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, exceeding analyst expectations. However, executives expressed caution about the rest of the year due to potential economic headwinds from tariffs. Meta CFO Susan Li noted reduced spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters due to the cessation of the de minimis trade loophole. Other companies like Pinterest and Snap echoed similar concerns about slower Asia-specific ad sales and broader macroeconomic uncertainty, with Snap even pulling its second-quarter guidance due to the unpredictable economy.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store following a recent court ruling that favored the game maker. The ruling stated that Apple cannot charge commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return after being removed in 2020 for circumventing Apple's payment system. While Apple could still reject the submission, this move represents a significant development in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple. The ruling has already prompted other developers, including Amazon and Spotify, to update their apps to avoid Apple's commissions.</p>

          <p>The Army will adopt new fitness standards for soldiers in combat roles on June 1, with the most significant change being the implementation of the same standards for men and women. The test includes deadlifts, hand-release push-ups, planks, a two-mile run, and the sprint-drag-carry, designed to assess a well-rounded mix of functional exercises. Experts say the test is an excellent gauge of overall fitness, balancing strength, speed, endurance, and core stability. The minimum performances listed reflect the new standards for a passing score for 30-year-old combat soldiers.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter passed away at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often aligned himself with liberal justices, vexing Republicans. Notable decisions include upholding the right to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and dissenting in Bush v. Gore. After retiring in 2009, Souter continued to serve as a judge on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.</p>
