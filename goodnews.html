        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 index surged to a new record high, surpassing 6,156 as investors showed resilience against concerns over international tariffs and conflict in the Middle East. The market has demonstrated significant growth, with the S&P 500 climbing over 20% since an April low, fueled by cautious optimism about eased trade tensions and stable economic data. Recent indicators, including sturdy hiring and controlled inflation, have bolstered investor confidence despite ongoing geopolitical challenges. This rally reflects a shift in sentiment, with Wall Street firms softening earlier predictions of an economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated that the team is holding discussions with four-time world champion Max Verstappen about a potential move for the 2026 season. Verstappen is currently contracted with Red Bull until 2028, but his deal reportedly contains exit clauses. The speculation is fueled by Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' potential advantage with the new 2026 engine regulations. Russell's comments suggest his own contract negotiations may be influenced by Mercedes' pursuit of the Dutch driver, adding a significant layer of intrigue to the Formula 1 driver market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is actively rallying support for a major legislative package, urging Americans to contact their lawmakers to ensure its passage by the July 4th holiday. Speaking at a rally, Trump highlighted key provisions, including border funding and a tax exemption for tips, framing the bill as the fulfillment of his major 2024 campaign promises. The administration is facing challenges in the Senate, particularly after a Medicaid provision was rejected by the parliamentarian. Despite the setback, the White House remains committed to the deadline and is heavily engaged in negotiations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are divided on the value of purchasing whole life insurance for children as a financial planning tool. Proponents argue it locks in low premiums and guarantees insurability for life, which can be beneficial if a child later develops health issues. Critics, however, contend that it's statistically unnecessary and offers lower returns compared to other investment vehicles like 529 plans or brokerage accounts. The decision ultimately depends on a family's specific financial goals, risk tolerance, and concerns about future insurability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of a fixed rate for a set term. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, with some short-term CDs offering over 4.4%. Experts note that the current market features an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, savers are advised to compare offers from different institutions, particularly online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

The value of this precious metal is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, inflation rates, central bank policies, and geopolitical instability.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club, led by Jim Cramer, is selling a portion of its holdings in Disney stock following a significant price rebound to over $120 per share. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 this year, gaining about 9%, which Cramer attributes to CEO Bob Iger's successful turnaround plan. Citing the principle of "discipline trumps conviction," the trust is taking profits after having bought heavily when the stock was less favored. While the fund is reducing its position, the analysis suggests that Disney's recovery is likely to continue. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team in China has identified a key genetic pathway that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically seen in animals like salamanders. The study, published in *Science*, found that mammals' limited regenerative ability is linked to an insufficient production of retinoic acid, a vitamin A derivative. By reactivating a dormant "genetic switch" in mice, the scientists were able to restore the production of this acid and trigger ear tissue regeneration. This discovery could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in vertebrates, including humans.</p>

In his announcement, Adams contrasted his record with that of his chief rival, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, whom he painted as an inexperienced opponent with "empty promises." Adams, who is now running as an independent, is navigating the aftermath of a tumultuous first term that included a federal corruption investigation, which was later dismissed.
