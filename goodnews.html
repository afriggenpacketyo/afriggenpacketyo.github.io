          <p>President Trump announced that a group of House Republican holdouts have agreed to support key cryptocurrency regulation bills after a meeting at the White House. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, had unexpectedly failed a procedural vote earlier when 13 Republicans sided with Democrats. The quick reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference, with a new vote expected soon to advance the bills. Crypto-linked stocks saw a dip following the initial failed vote.</p>

          <p>President Trump, alongside corporate leaders, announced a landmark $90 billion investment package from private companies for Pennsylvania's energy and technology sectors. The initiative, unveiled at a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, aims to establish a new artificial intelligence economy powered by the state's energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear. Projects will include building new data centers and an energy innovation hub, with proponents claiming it will create tens of thousands of jobs. The event drew some protests focused on environmental and ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House is considering the "Genius Act," bipartisan legislation that aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Supporters argue that by establishing clear rules and consumer protections, the bill could make stablecoins a more reliable and mainstream option for faster, cheaper financial transactions. The bill is part of a broader "Crypto Week" push by Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration to foster the digital asset industry in the U.S. This article explains the technology and the potential impacts of the proposed law.

          <p>In an article published in a leading Communist Party journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's commitment to globalization and free trade. He spoke out against unilateral sanctions and the building of trade barriers, positioning China in contrast to the more protectionist policies seen elsewhere. Xi's statements, made as China hosts a major supply chain expo, emphasize a desire to promote inclusive economic globalization and uphold a multilateral trading system. The article compiles several of his statements on the topic made over the past decade.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Encourages Local Governments to Use Legislation to Boost Economy</h2>

          <p>A recent article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged China's local governments to use their legislative powers as a "propeller" for economic development. The piece argues that tailored, local laws create a stable and predictable environment for businesses to operate within a rule-of-law framework. This reflects a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal structures to manage economic issues and adapt to local needs. The call comes as China seeks new ways to stimulate its economy.</p>

          <p>Marine scientists are undertaking a novel conservation effort by crossbreeding Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's native population to restore the state's dying reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical reef-building species, has been lost to disease and warming waters. By introducing genes from the more resilient Honduran corals, researchers hope the new "Flonduran" hybrid will be better equipped to survive future marine heatwaves. The first batch of these crossbred corals was recently planted off the coast of Miami.</p>

The team will debut a bold, all-gold "Charger Power" uniform, which some have compared to mustard or the Minions from "Despicable Me." They also introduced a "Super Chargers" uniform featuring navy blue jerseys, pants, and helmets, intended as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and 2000s. The new designs aim to connect with different fan demographics and eras of the team's history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia that includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods, lower than the 32% rate he had previously threatened. In exchange, Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to significant purchases from the U.S., including $15 billion in energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The deal was reportedly finalized after a call between Trump and the Indonesian president. This pact is one of several the administration has been pursuing to renegotiate trade relationships with various global partners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. Proponents say the practice is cheaper, supports local industry, and can help formalize and improve conditions for small-scale miners. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence suggesting his innocence, including shaky witness testimony. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and a judge declared him factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his civil lawsuit, which alleged that sheriff's detectives had failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, authored by Professor Gillian Leng, also calls for standardized uniforms and for associates not to be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow concerns over patient safety and a lack of clarity about the roles, which were introduced to support doctors. The changes are intended to more clearly define the scope and limitations of these healthcare positions.</p>

          <p>The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, has announced a major £50 million renovation of its historic Palm House, which will require the building to close for five years starting in 2027. The project involves repairing the corroded ironwork, replacing 16,000 panes of glass, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the ambitious makeover is to make the Victorian-era glasshouse, which requires constant heating, net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The planning permission has been submitted, and the complex process of moving the plant collection has begun.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an ad for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims, including that its ingredients can "help you feel calm" and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that the ad for the cucumber and mint-flavored drink, which contains magnesium and other supplements, implied benefits that are not permitted on the official register for food and drink marketing. The ASA ruled that the ad breached codes by suggesting the drink could treat or cure human disease and must not appear again in its current form.</p>
