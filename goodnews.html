        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's recent £18.1 million acquisition, goalkeeper Senne Lammens, has yet to make his debut, leaving fans and analysts to speculate when he will get his chance. The 23-year-old Belgian has reportedly impressed in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals since his transfer from Royal Antwerp. However, head coach Ruben Amorim has so far opted for the more experienced Altay Bayindir, citing the need for a gradual transition for Lammens into a new league. With Bayindir's performance metrics ranking low among Premier League goalkeepers, it appears to be a matter of when, not if, Lammens will be introduced.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch, once a struggling talent at Bayern Munich, has transformed into one of Europe's elite midfielders under the guidance of manager Arne Slot. After a quiet first season, Slot repositioned Gravenberch into a holding midfield role, where he has become a standout performer, driving Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table. His defensive contributions have remained consistent, but he has been granted more attacking freedom, resulting in a significant increase in shots and chances created. Analysts now compare him favorably to other top midfielders, crediting Slot's trust and tactical adjustments for unlocking his full potential.</p>

The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, into a late-stage Phase III trial, a critical step before seeking regulatory approval. Roche has been aggressively building its obesity treatment pipeline, including acquiring U.S. biotech Carmot Therapeutics and partnering on other drug candidates like Petrelintide. The company aims to launch its suite of treatments by 2030, signaling a serious long-term commitment to this competitive sector.</p>

          <p>State-affiliated buyers in China, known as the "national team," now hold approximately $553 billion in domestic stocks, a figure that surpasses the total holdings of foreign investors. This strategic purchasing is viewed as a government effort to stabilize and bolster the nation's stock market, which recently saw a key benchmark reach a decade high. The state's significant market presence, second only to mutual funds, reflects a policy of promoting financial stability and encouraging household wealth preservation through equities as the property market slows. This intervention is expected to persist, potentially driving stocks higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from securing the National League West title after a resilient 5-4 extra-innings victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game featured an unconventional strategy, with starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw delivering crucial scoreless innings out of the bullpen. After the bullpen squandered a late lead, the Dodgers rallied in the 11th inning with a go-ahead RBI single from Tommy Edman. The team's ability to improvise and demonstrate resilience in a playoff-like atmosphere highlights the creative measures they may need to employ to defend their championship title.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region were mostly higher on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street, where a sell-off in major technology stocks like Nvidia and Oracle continued for a second day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, boosted by a strong debut from automaker Chery Automobile, whose shares jumped 11% after its IPO. Mainland China's CSI 300 also advanced, while markets in South Korea and Taiwan showed more modest movements. The ongoing caution in the tech sector reflects investor skepticism about the sustainability of the AI-driven rally, even as other sectors show resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

Analysts note that while BYD has dominated headlines, Chery has been quietly building a strong global manufacturing presence, which positions it well to mitigate risks from tariffs imposed by the U.S. and Europe on Chinese-made electric vehicles. The company's strategy of local production is seen as a key advantage over competitors focused solely on exporting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with federal immigration agents to receive certain FEMA grants. The decision is a setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit their assistance with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit was filed by 20 states, which argued that tying critical emergency preparedness funding to immigration policy was unlawful. U.S. District Judge William Smith sided with the states, calling the policy "arbitrary and capricious" and noting the irreparable harm that could result from the loss of disaster relief funds.</p>

While the investment provides OpenAI with capital for operations, the majority of the funds are earmarked for accessing the graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for training and running its AI models.

          <p>Africa imported a record amount of Chinese-made solar panels in the first seven months of the year, signaling a rapid expansion of solar energy capacity across the continent. A study by Oxford Economics revealed that imports reached 9,516 megawatts, a significant increase from 6,625 megawatts during the same period last year. This growth is driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria.

          <p>Facing declining prices and rising operational costs, some cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are participating in a state program to convert their unproductive bogs back into natural wetlands. The initiative pays farmers to undertake the restoration, which helps filter water, store carbon, and provide storm resilience, while also creating public recreational space. For many multi-generational farmers, the program offers a way to preserve their land ecologically as they face economic headwinds and approach retirement. Over the past 15 years, the state has successfully restored over 500 acres, with plans to restore another 500.</p>
