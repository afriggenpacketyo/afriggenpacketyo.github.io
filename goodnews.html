        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winning numbers for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, which marks the game's second-largest prize ever, have been drawn as 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. This substantial prize, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million, grew after no winning tickets were sold for the preceding $1.4 billion drawing. As of now, it is unconfirmed if any participants successfully matched all winning numbers. Powerball emphasizes responsible gambling, highlighting that a portion of each $2 ticket supports local community initiatives. The odds of securing the grand prize are approximately 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. Scientists can precisely control the launch location and even enable the materials to swim by manipulating light flow. This article highlights cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism, detailed in their paper "Launching by cavitation" published in Science.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka claimed her second consecutive US Open title, defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) in a hard-fought final. The world No. 1 overcame moments of self-doubt and a late challenge from Anisimova, demonstrating improved emotional composure compared to her earlier Grand Slam final losses this year. Sabalenka, a 27-year-old from Belarus, earned her fourth Grand Slam trophy, all on hard courts, becoming the first woman since Serena Williams (2012-14) to achieve back-to-back Flushing Meadows victories. The article notes Anisimova's strong performance, despite the loss, and Sabalenka's tactical adjustments learned from past defeats.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S. are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, aiming to reduce distractions and improve student engagement. Students are required to place their phones in these locked pouches, which can only be unlocked at designated stations. While some students and educators welcome the change, reporting increased in-person interaction and a more focused learning environment, others express skepticism or attempt to bypass the system. This article highlights the cultural shift in schools, with over 2.5 million students now using these pouches, despite debates over their cost and effectiveness in creating "phone-free spaces."</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special gifts from the MLB teams after a viral incident where an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game. The ball, hit by Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, initially landed near the woman but was given to the boy by his father. After the woman's heated confrontation, the ball was returned to her. Recognizing the disappointment, a Marlins staffer gave the boy a gift bag, and Bader later met the young fan, presenting him with an autographed baseball bat. This article highlights a heartwarming resolution to a public dispute.</p>

          <p>Reform UK is actively working to shed its image as a "one-man-band" dominated by leader Nigel Farage, by promoting new candidates and expanding its electoral presence. The party's recent conference showcased hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with their old party. Reform UK aims to significantly increase its representation in councils and parliaments, requiring thousands of vetted candidates for upcoming elections in London, Wales, and Scotland. This article explores the party's efforts to build a broader "people's army" and refine its candidate selection process after past controversies.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoy military equipment, such as inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery, to mislead Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition. These full-scale imitations, ranging from small radars to tanks and even soldier dummies, are designed to trick the enemy into wasting resources. For instance, plywood models of M777 howitzers, costing about $500-$600, are frequently targeted by $35,000 Russian Lancet kamikaze drones, demonstrating a significant cost-saving tactic. This article highlights how these decoys are meticulously deployed to recreate real positions, effectively deceiving both enemy surveillance and even some visiting officers.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, designed to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. This system, which will replace manual passport stamping, aims to enhance security and streamline travel, but concerns exist about potential long queues during initial registration. Travelers from non-EU countries, including the UK, will need to register biometric information, fingerprints, and a photo upon their first use, typically at kiosks at border crossings. This article details the phased rollout, with full implementation expected by April 2026, and highlights efforts by transport hubs like Eurostar and Eurotunnel to manage the transition.</p>
