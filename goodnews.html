          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 3.5% following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion).

Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of its shares to shareholders via dividends and the financial unit will list its financial operation this year. However, the company's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four members of the Trump administration, including HHS Secretary Robert F.

They argue that welfare should be a short-term support rather than a long-term dependency and point to the success of the 1996 welfare reform act. The proposed policy would require recipients to work, participate in job training, or volunteer for at least 20 hours a week, with exceptions for those caring for young children or with health issues. The authors assert that work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens communities.</p>
