          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a notable rise on Friday following the White House announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are scheduled to hold talks next week. President Trump is slated to travel to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea before meeting Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. Major regional indices, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, climbed in response to the news, reflecting investor optimism for diplomatic progress. Japan also reported an acceleration in its core inflation rate, while South Korea's finance ministry signaled readiness for foreign exchange market stabilization measures amid won-dollar volatility.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's political stability and long-term strategic planning are key drivers behind its rapid green energy transition, contrasting this with perceived policy inconsistencies in Western nations. China has committed to peaking carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, significantly boosting renewable energy's share in its power grid from 40% to 60% since 2021. Major infrastructure projects, such as ultra-high-voltage power lines transferring clean energy from the north and west to the populous east, exemplify this commitment. The article posits that China's governance model ensures policy continuity, accelerating its decarbonization efforts despite its historical reliance on coal.</p>

          <p>Intel reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue, indicating a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs, which sent its stock up 6% in extended trading. This earnings report is the first since the U.S. government became a top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration. Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia in September, a deal aimed at integrating Intel's central processors with Nvidia's dominant AI graphics processors to revive growth in its data center CPU business. Despite accounting complexities related to the government's stake and a recent subsidiary sale, Intel anticipates continued strong demand for its chips. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco after a direct conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech company bosses. The "surge" operation, initially intended to address public safety concerns, was called off as Mayor Lurie highlighted significant reductions in crime across the city, with violent crime and homicides reaching decades-low levels. Lurie also confirmed receiving assurances from Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding federal support in combating the fentanyl crisis. While San Francisco's deployment is averted, the status of federal operations in nearby Oakland remains uncertain, prompting local leaders there to prepare for potential federal actions.</p>

BeOne's flagship small-molecule BTK inhibitor has already driven the company to its first profitable six months, positioning it to capitalize on the growing market for advanced cancer treatments.

The faithfuls continued their dismal performance, once again failing to identify a traitor, prompting Winkleman to express genuine dismay over their inability to see the truth. Comedian Alan Carr, fully embracing his role as a traitor, displayed increasing ruthlessness in discussions about who to "murder" next. The episode concluded with the banishment of Sir Stephen Fry, another faithful, leaving only nine players, three of whom are traitors, and setting the stage for a tense, face-to-face murder at the chessboard.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's title contenders, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" character as the three drivers head into the final five races of the Formula 1 season. Piastri currently holds a 14-point lead, but Verstappen, despite being 40 points adrift, has demonstrated exceptional form with three wins and a second place in the last four races. Hamilton, who had an intense rivalry with Verstappen in 2021, emphasized the immense pressure on the leading drivers and the relative advantage of being the "hunter." McLaren has removed internal team rules, allowing its drivers to race freely, though an earlier collision led to past "repercussions."</p>
