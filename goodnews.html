          <p>The Florida Panthers triumphed over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, securing their second consecutive Stanley Cup victory and marking the NHL's first repeat champions since 2020-21.

Tkachuk declared the team a dynasty, highlighting their impressive playoff record since his arrival, while Bennett was named playoff MVP.

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders have launched an action plan to mitigate risks in critical mineral supply chains, largely stemming from dependence on China. Gathering in Canada, the leaders agreed to enhance cooperation to safeguard economic security against nonmarket practices, without directly naming China. The plan includes monitoring mineral shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and diversifying mining, processing, and recycling. The G7 aims to develop a road map for standards-based markets for critical minerals by year-end, reflecting extraction, processing, and trade costs, while also increasing investment in responsible projects.

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global influence, according to People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This measure is part of eight financial policies aimed at boosting the yuan's overseas adoption and accelerating Shanghai's development as a global financial hub. China has already developed a multi-channel, wide-coverage cross-border renminbi clearing network and will pilot structural monetary policy tools in Shanghai. The trials will include refinancing schemes for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals applying for new passports, renewing expired ones, or changing their name or sex designation to choose the gender they identify with. The judge found that the policy discriminated against transgender Americans and failed to provide a rationale related to an important governmental interest. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling, while the White House has criticized the decision as an attempt to push radical gender ideology.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies in the rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a deepening talent crunch. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is approximately 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with more experienced roles commanding even higher wages. This surge in pay contrasts with a generally subdued hiring landscape in China, where the job market faces pressure from slowing economic growth and corporate earnings.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island House passed a $14.4 billion budget for the upcoming year, which includes a new tax on high-end vacation homes and increased funding for health care providers. The budget, which is around $120 million more than Governor Dan McKee proposed, passed with bipartisan support after nearly three hours of debate and now moves to the state Senate. The budget includes increases in Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care practices, hospitals, and nursing homes, funded in part by a tax on second homes worth more than $1 million. The "Taylor Swift tax" was indexed to inflation after concerns were raised by Republicans and some Democrats.</p>

Meta's alleged attempts to poach OpenAI staffers underscore the industry's frenzy to hire top engineers for AI model development. The comments come shortly after Meta invested $14.3 billion in data-labeling startup Scale AI and hired its top boss, Alexandr Wang, to lead its new superintelligence team. Meta, once a leader in open-source AI models, has faced staff departures and postponed the launches of new open-source AI models.</p>
