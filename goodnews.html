          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions. The article highlights the role of U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-crypto agenda and the Senate's progress on crypto legislation as key factors supporting the market. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's rise reflects investors seeking alternative stores of value. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a known bitcoin skeptic, also stated that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential for annuities to run out of money, emphasizing that it depends on the type of annuity. While immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to provide guaranteed income for life, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities tied to investment performance, and annuities with withdrawal riders can be depleted. The article advises readers to choose lifetime income annuities, diversify retirement income sources, and research the financial health of the issuing insurance company to mitigate risks. It also warns against overdrawing funds from annuities with withdrawal clauses.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all titles to the shelves after a review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The new review identified only about 20 books that need to be removed pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal follows a Pentagon memo setting a deadline for military services to remove books touching on diversity, race, and gender issues. The initial Navy search used its own terms, identifying a broader range of titles.</p>
