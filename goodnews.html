          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their purchasing power. Current high-yield CDs provide returns that outpace the inflation rate, and these rates can be locked in for the duration of the CD term. This article explains that while national average CD yields are modest, online banks often offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs. It advises consumers to compare different options to secure the best possible returns on their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

This article provides the national average interest rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances as of late July 2025. It suggests that potential relief for borrowers may be on the horizon if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes.

While the national average savings rate is low, top high-yield accounts offer significantly higher returns, potentially earning over ten times more interest than standard accounts. The article highlights that online banks typically provide the best rates due to lower overhead costs and often have low minimum deposit requirements and no monthly fees.

This article reports the price of gold as of late July 2025 and explores the various factors that cause its value to fluctuate. Key influences include supply and demand dynamics, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, and central bank policies play a significant role in determining the precious metal's price, making it a complex but historically resilient investment.

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has launched formal investigations into four companies operating 34 pornography websites for potential non-compliance with new age verification laws. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, require sites with adult content to use effective tools to prevent access by children. The investigation targets companies with a combined nine million monthly visitors, prioritizing them based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm. This enforcement action comes amid a public debate over the law's effectiveness and privacy implications, with some critics pointing to the use of VPNs to circumvent the checks.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's own operators. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, control spiraling costs, and could be fully operational by 2035. This development introduces the first-ever rival bid for the long-debated expansion project, with the government now set to review both competing proposals for the major infrastructure upgrade.</p>

          <h2>Eli Lilly's Mounjaro Demonstrates Heart Health Benefits in Trial Against Older Drug Trulicity</h2>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's popular diabetes drug Mounjaro was shown to provide heart health benefits for patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The study found Mounjaro was not inferior to the company's older drug, Trulicity, in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events and also showed a lower rate of death from any cause. While the results did not meet some analyst benchmarks for superiority, the company believes the data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment. The findings come as Trulicity faces a patent expiration, potentially solidifying Mounjaro's market position.</p>

          <p>With a key tariff deadline of August 12 approaching, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated his belief that "we have the makings of a deal" with China. Following two days of what he described as "tough" negotiations, Bessent expressed confidence that an agreement will be reached, although some technical details still need to be finalized. The U.S. and China are currently in a tariff truce, having previously imposed aggressive duties on each other's goods. Any final agreement would require personal sign-off from President Trump, who has not yet discussed the latest developments with the Treasury Secretary.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has reinstated its full-year financial guidance after suspending it due to tariff uncertainty, now estimating a net impact of $2 billion from the new trade policies. The company's updated forecast includes adjusted earnings of $6.5 to $7.5 billion, which is lower than its pre-tariff projections. Ford's CFO noted that the company is in "near-daily" communication with the Trump administration regarding the tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminum. The automaker's estimated tariff impact is less than rival General Motors, as Ford has a larger U.S. manufacturing footprint and imports fewer vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of deadly floods along Texas's Guadalupe River, resident Dondi Persyn has started a Facebook page, "Found on the Guadalupe River," to reunite recovered personal items with their owners. The initiative has become a significant community effort, returning thousands of poignant mementos—from jewelry to children's backpacks—to families who lost everything. The floods claimed at least 135 lives, including many children from a local summer camp, making the return of these items especially meaningful.

          <p>The World Meteorological Organization has officially recognized a new world record for the longest single lightning flash, which stretched 515 miles across the U.S. Great Plains in 2017. The massive bolt extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, a distance comparable to that between Paris and Venice. This record, along with another for the longest duration flash at 17.1 seconds, was made possible by advanced space-based mapping technology from geostationary satellites. Scientists say these findings underscore that lightning can travel vast distances from its parent thunderstorm, reinforcing the importance of seeking shelter during electrical storms.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote in Taiwan targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. Analysts suggest this outcome has, for the moment, averted a potential crisis in cross-strait relations with mainland China. The recall campaign, framed by the ruling party as a battle to "resist China, protect Taiwan," could have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of rising anti-China sentiment if successful. While the immediate political confrontation is over, the event introduces new uncertainties into Taiwan's domestic politics and its delicate relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural phenomenon of Labubus, a line of bunny-eared monster toys from Pop Mart that has become a massive commercial success. Sold in limited, late-night online "drops," the toys have cultivated a fervent following willing to pay high prices on the resale market. Their "cute-ugly" aesthetic is highly polarizing, which experts suggest only fuels the craze by creating a sense of in-group belonging for fans. The purchasing process, which involves "blind boxes" and a race against time, taps into psychological mechanisms similar to gambling, making the thrill of the chase a key part of the appeal.</p>

While both earned massive windfalls, their strategies have diverged, impacting their stock performance. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA vaccine pipeline, investing heavily in new shots but facing high costs and a struggling stock. In contrast, BioNTech has used its earnings to diversify through acquisitions, notably moving into promising new areas of cancer treatment, which has been better received by Wall Street.
