          <p>The German government has officially approved the export of 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Turkey, resolving a lengthy period of uncertainty. A government spokesman confirmed the decision, which was made by Germany's Federal Security Council, the body responsible for approving arms exports. Turkey had long been negotiating to purchase the jets, which are produced by a consortium including Germany, the UK, Italy, and Spain. Shortly after the German approval was reported, Turkey and the UK signed a memorandum of understanding to proceed with the acquisition of the fighter jets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners finding it difficult to qualify for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) due to higher interest rates and stricter lending standards have several alternative options. Lending experts suggest first understanding the specific reason for denial, which could be a high debt-to-income ratio, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score. Improving one's financial profile by reducing debt and boosting credit can increase approval odds. Alternative financing products include fixed-rate home equity loans, cash-out refinances, personal loans, or, for smaller projects, a 0% APR credit card for disciplined borrowers.

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former city traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rates. After a decade-long legal battle, the court ruled that their trials were unfair due to errors in the judge's directions to the jury, rendering the convictions unsafe. The men, who were among 19 traders convicted in the UK and US, argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then common commercial practices. The Serious Fraud Office has stated it will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system, named Aeneas, that can help fill in missing text from fragmented ancient Roman inscriptions. The tool not only suggests missing words but can also help date the artifacts and place them geographically by cross-referencing a vast database of 176,000 known inscriptions. While AI can introduce errors, tests showed that historians working in tandem with Aeneas produced more accurate results than either could alone. Prominent Cambridge historian Mary Beard described the technology as potentially transformative for accelerating the study of ancient history and revealing previously unidentified connections.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Ben Schneider, the frontman of the band Lord Huron, delved into the themes of his new album, "The Cosmic Selector: Vol. 1." Schneider explained that his music often poses unanswerable questions about life, consciousness, and the cosmos, embracing mystery rather than seeking definitive answers. He discussed his creative process, which involves writing from the perspective of various characters and his collaboration with author Karl Ove Knausgård, who wrote a discourse for the album. Schneider also reflected on the role of nostalgia and the challenge of living in the present moment.</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in three U.S. cities that will allow women drivers and riders to request a preference for being matched with other women. The feature, aimed at enhancing safety and comfort on the platform, will be tested in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit starting next month. While the preference is not guaranteed, it is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women pairings. This initiative expands on a similar feature Uber introduced for female drivers in Saudi Arabia in 2019, as the company continues to address long-standing safety concerns.</p>

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has affirmed that a "clean, healthy and sustainable environment" is a human right. The ruling states that countries have a legal obligation to protect the climate for present and future generations and that failing to do so may violate international law. The case, initiated by Pacific Island nations, clarifies that states must cooperate to prevent climate harm and set ambitious national targets. While not legally binding, the opinion carries significant moral and legal weight and could influence future climate negotiations and litigation.</p>

          <p>Lenin's Mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square is seeing a significant increase in visitors ahead of its scheduled closure for repairs, which will last until 2027. The tomb, which has housed the preserved body of the Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin since his death in 1924, was a major pilgrimage site in the Soviet era but saw interest wane after the USSR's collapse. The current surge is seen less as Soviet nostalgia and more as a final opportunity for people to see the historical curiosity, especially as there has been ongoing public debate for years about finally burying Lenin's body.</p>

          <p>After nearly two decades without a confirmed sighting, scientists have rediscovered the Barbados threadsnake, the world's smallest-known snake. The tiny reptile, which can fit on a coin and grows to a maximum of four inches, was found by a research team under a rock in a small forest patch on the island. The species is blind, burrows for termites and ants, and was feared to be extinct. Its rediscovery is considered significant for local conservation efforts, as many of Barbados's other endemic species have already been lost due to habitat destruction.</p>

          <p>With household debt climbing due to high interest rates and the resumption of student loan payments, experts outline several debt relief strategies. For disciplined individuals, the debt avalanche method, which prioritizes paying off high-interest debt first, can save the most money over time. Debt consolidation, using tools like a personal loan or a 0% APR balance transfer card, can lower interest costs and simplify payments. For those with more severe struggles, a non-profit credit counselor can arrange a debt management plan, while debt settlement or bankruptcy remain options for overwhelming situations.

At 19, Choi defended herself against a man who pinned her down, but the court ruled her actions exceeded reasonable self-defense. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial to clear her name. At the new hearing, prosecutors formally apologized for the past injustice and asked the court to acquit her, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

His seat in the 17th Congressional District is highly competitive and was crucial in determining the narrow Republican House majority in both 2022 and 2024.
