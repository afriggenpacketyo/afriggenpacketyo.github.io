          <p>Seventeen-year-old gymnast Hezly Rivera has won her first national title at the U.S. Championships, establishing herself as a leading figure in the lead-up to the 2028 Olympics. Rivera's two-day total of 112.000 secured her victory over competitors like Leanne Wong and Joscelyn Roberson. A year after being the youngest member of the gold-medal-winning team in Paris, Rivera demonstrated polished steadiness and confidence, particularly with a strong performance on the balance beam. Her win not only positions her favorably for the upcoming world championships in Indonesia but also signals a new era for the U.S. women's gymnastics program.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not run for governor of California in 2026, a decision that has significantly altered the political landscape for the primary. Following her announcement, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, previously a strong contender, also dropped out of the gubernatorial race to run for state treasurer instead. The field of Democratic candidates remains crowded, with figures like former Rep. Katie Porter, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. This development opens the door for new potential candidates, such as real estate mogul Rick Caruso, and leaves the high-profile race without a clear frontrunner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In its first major move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. broadcast rights for TKO Group's UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC events, including 13 marquee pay-per-view cards and 30 "Fight Nights," will be available on the Paramount+ streaming service, with select events simulcast on CBS. This deal marks a significant shift away from the pay-per-view model previously used by ESPN+, as Paramount will not charge additional fees for the events. The acquisition is seen as a strategic move by Paramount's new CEO, David Ellison, to secure a scarce, high-value sports asset that provides year-round content.</p>

          <p>The arrival of South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min at Los Angeles FC is being viewed as a major opportunity for Major League Soccer to expand its presence in Asia. After a celebrated career at Tottenham Hotspur, the 33-year-old attacker brings immense popularity and commercial appeal from a continent where he is a cultural icon. Marketing experts believe LAFC has a two-year window to leverage Son's brand through tours, content partnerships, and endorsements with global Korean companies like Samsung and Kia. While some Korean fans initially preferred he stay in Europe, many now support his decision, setting the stage for a potential surge in MLS viewership and engagement across Asia.</p>

          <p>Over the past decade, Ethereum has delivered extraordinary returns, transforming an initial investment of $1,000 in 2015 into nearly $1.4 million today. The blockchain platform has evolved from trading at under $3 to its current price near $4,000, establishing itself as the dominant force in the decentralized application space. It leads all other blockchains in the number of developers working on its platform and the total value locked in its protocols. Recent technical upgrades, including the shift to a more efficient proof-of-stake system and reductions in transaction fees, have addressed previous criticisms and continue to enhance its capabilities for the future.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his government will officially recognize a Palestinian state, a decision to be formalized at the United Nations in September. This move aligns Australia with other Western nations like France, Britain, and Canada, which have signaled similar intentions amid growing international momentum for a two-state solution. Albanese described the suffering in Gaza as a "humanitarian catastrophe" and stated the recognition is predicated on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no role for Hamas in government. The decision has been criticized by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but is seen by Australia as a practical contribution towards breaking the cycle of violence.</p>

          <p>Police in India have arrested six men accused of running a fake law enforcement agency to extort money from victims. The group operated from a rented office in a New Delhi suburb labeled the "International Police and Crime Investigation Bureau," complete with police-like logos. The perpetrators allegedly forged documents and used a website to solicit "donations," falsely claiming affiliation with Interpol and other international crime units while posing as public servants. This incident comes just weeks after another man was arrested nearby for running a fake embassy of a fictional nation to defraud job seekers with promises of employment abroad.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Questions the Utility of the Term 'Artificial General Intelligence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 07:18:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed skepticism about the term "artificial general intelligence" (AGI), suggesting it has become less useful as AI capabilities advance rapidly. AGI refers to a hypothetical AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can, a long-stated goal for OpenAI. Altman argues that the term lacks a clear, universally accepted definition and that it's more productive to think about a continuum of advancing model capabilities rather than a binary state of AGI or not. Other experts agree, noting that the vague, sci-fi nature of AGI can create hype that distracts from tangible progress in more specialized areas of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the Meaning and Implications of AI-Generated Sacred Texts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The emergence of AI chatbots capable of generating sacred texts, such as a Buddhist sutra created by ChatGPT, is prompting a profound discussion on the nature of spiritual meaning and authorship. This article examines the "Xeno Sutra," an AI-written text that exhibits conceptual subtlety and classic Buddhist imagery, rewarding close reading despite its mechanistic origin. It explores how different religious traditions might approach such texts, noting that non-dualistic faiths like Buddhism may be more receptive than Abrahamic religions focused on divine authorship. The analysis suggests that the value of these texts can lie in their impact on the reader, but also cautions against the risks of decontextualizing wisdom and losing the communal aspect of religion.</p>

          <p>The rock band My Chemical Romance has announced a UK tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of their iconic album, "The Black Parade." After a series of cryptic social media posts, the band confirmed two dates at London's Wembley Stadium for July 10 and 11, 2026. This announcement follows their successful sold-out North American stadium tour, "Long Live: The Black Parade," which began earlier this year. While fans have expressed widespread excitement online, some have raised concerns that the tour dates are currently limited to London, hoping for additional shows across the country. The band last performed in the UK in 2022 as part of their reunion tour.</p>

          <h2>Nearly 600 Pounds of Cocaine Seized from Banana Shipment in Greece</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 06:20:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Greek police have seized nearly 600 pounds of cocaine, with an estimated street value of over $6.5 million, found hidden inside a container of bananas imported from Ecuador. The operation was initiated after a tip from the United Kingdom's National Crime Agency about the illicit cargo. Authorities tracked the container from the port of Thessaloniki to a suburb of Athens, where they arrested three men as they began to unload it. This seizure is the latest in a global trend of large-scale drug smuggling operations using banana shipments as cover, with similar busts occurring recently in Russia, Norway, and the Dominican Republic.</p>
