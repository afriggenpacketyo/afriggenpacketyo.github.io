          <p>Marks and Spencer has restarted accepting online orders after halting purchases through its website in April due to a major cyberattack. Shoppers can now purchase a selection of fashion products for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales. The company plans to make more fashion, beauty, and homeware products available in the coming days, with click and collect and delivery services to Northern Ireland resuming in the coming weeks. The return of online shopping is a key milestone for the retailer as they recover from the attack, which caused empty shelves and delivery delays.</p>

          <p>Auto parts supplier O'Reilly Automotive has implemented a 15-for-1 forward stock split, the largest in the company's history, making its shares more accessible to retail investors. The company's stock has surged more than 57,000% since its IPO in 1993, driven by factors such as drivers holding onto their vehicles longer due to rising new vehicle costs. O'Reilly's hub-and-spoke distribution model and share-repurchase program have also contributed to its success. The company's aggressive repurchase program is making its stock more fundamentally attractive to value investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international crackdown has been launched to protect social media users from misleading financial promotions by some financial influencers. The initiative, involving regulators from multiple countries including the UK, has led to numerous warning alerts, takedown requests, and cease and desist letters. In the UK, the FCA has also made arrests and authorized criminal proceedings against individuals. Many financial influencers are acting legitimately, but others may be illegally promoting products or services without authorization, often using the pretense of a lavish lifestyle to promote success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from government stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to curb elevated prices. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the 2020 rice to be sold in stores at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness, leading Koizumi to express interest in increasing rice imports. Rice has been in short supply at stores in Japan since last summer, leading to prices doubling compared to the previous year, prompting suspicions of hoarding among wholesalers and farmers.</p>
