        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian in Scotland is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, which costs ¬£6,000 for a four-infusion program with psychotherapy. Ketamine, an anesthetic, is used 'off-label' for depression, and some patients find it makes them more receptive to psychotherapy, although it is also linked to health problems and fatalities. Psychiatrists emphasize the need for diagnosed conditions and assessments before treatment, hoping to make it more accessible through the NHS.</p>

Muncy's grand slam in the sixth inning shifted the game's momentum, and he later added a three-run home run, continuing his mid-season turnaround.

          <p>A 60 Minutes report details how research on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island, survived Hurricane Maria. The island is home to approximately 1,800 rhesus macaque monkeys, studied for their genetic similarity to humans. Despite initial fears of complete destruction, most monkeys survived, possibly by huddling together and consuming seaweed. Crucially, data and biological samples were preserved due to the relocation of offices and the dedication of staff who maintained generators to keep freezers running, ensuring the continuation of long-term research dating back to the 1930s.</p>

          <p>Cecilia Vega's 60 Minutes report focuses on sperm whale conservation efforts off the coast of Dominica, where National Geographic Explorer Enric Sala is working to protect these marine mammals. The sperm whale population is declining due to human threats like noise pollution, plastic consumption, and ship strikes, which prompted the creation of the first sperm whale reserve in the world. Vega recounts her experience snorkeling with sperm whales, describing it as both terrifying and rewarding, and highlights the importance of protecting these creatures for the benefit of Dominica and local communities. The sanctuary is 300 square miles and has a senior whale officer assigned to ensure the whales' security.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes segment explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammals, in Costa Rica. Zoologist Lucy Cooke explains how their slow movement is an energy-saving adaptation to a diet of toxic leaves, allowing them to thrive for 64 million years. The report also highlights the work of the Toucan Rescue Ranch, which rehabilitates sloths injured by power lines, and zoologist Becky Cliffe's population study, which reveals the impact of climate change on sloth health. Cooke hopes that studying sloths can teach humans about sustainability and a slower pace of life.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, including measures to lower energy costs for businesses. The plan includes scrapping green levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK businesses. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. Other measures include upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending. Conservative acting shadow energy secretary Andrew Bowie criticised the plans, saying the UK needed "a serious approach to energy policy" that "tackles the root cause of our high energy prices".</p>
