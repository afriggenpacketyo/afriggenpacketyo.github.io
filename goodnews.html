        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, a strategic move seen as an effort to compete with the growing number of popular open-source models from China. CEO Sam Altman described the new models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, as the "best and most usable" in the world, marking a return to the company's open-source origins. This development intensifies the competition in the AI landscape, where Chinese firms like Alibaba have been gaining significant traction. Analysts note that while this is a major step for OpenAI, China still leads in the sheer quantity of available open-source models.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk reported a massive 67% increase in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy. Despite this surge, the sales figure of 19.53 billion Danish kroner slightly missed analyst forecasts. The company recently lowered its full-year guidance due to anticipated weaker U.S. sales growth for both Wegovy and its diabetes drug Ozempic. In response to a subsequent drop in its share price, Novo Nordisk has pledged to implement cost-cutting measures and sharpen its commercial focus to ensure future growth.</p>

          <p>Seattle's upcoming mayoral election in November will feature a contest between progressive activist Katie Wilson and incumbent Mayor Bruce Harrell. The two candidates secured the top spots in Tuesday's nonpartisan primary, with Wilson receiving approximately 46% of the vote to Harrell's 45%. Wilson, known for co-founding the Transit Riders Union, is running on a platform of progressive policies, while Harrell is viewed as the more established, moderate candidate. The race is expected to be a tight contest, highlighting the city's political divisions as Wilson aims to become the first challenger to unseat an incumbent Seattle mayor in two decades.</p>

          <p>China's initiative to manage high-risk local government debt has achieved a significant milestone, with Inner Mongolia being the first of 12 flagged regions to be removed from the key watchlist. The autonomous region's progress was revealed in a local budget review, signaling success in Beijing's broader campaign to control financial risks. This development is part of a two-year plan launched in 2023 to restructure debt in heavily burdened provincial-level areas. The success in Inner Mongolia provides a potential model for other regions struggling with unsustainable debt levels, particularly as revenue from land sales has declined. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent decision by Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense difficulty athletes face when transitioning from other sports, particularly rugby. This article explores the key obstacles, such as the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another major challenge is the "planet theory," which posits that only a rare few possess the ideal size and athleticism for certain positions, making competition fierce for skill positions like running back. While some, like Jordan Mailata, have succeeded, the transition requires a unique combination of physical talent, rapid learning ability, and resilience.</p>

          <p>China is strategically increasing its coffee imports from major African producers like Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to meet soaring domestic demand and secure new supply chains. This push is supported by a zero-tariff policy for many African nations and is being spearheaded by rapidly expanding Chinese coffee chains such as Cotti Coffee. The move is seen by analysts as an effort to "lock in supply" by leveraging global trade uncertainties. Chinese companies are not only procuring large quantities of beans but are also investing in local infrastructure, including coffee industry development parks and processing factories in Africa.</p>

          <p>Nineteen-year-old Venezuelan forward David Martínez was the star of the match, scoring two goals to give Los Angeles FC a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the 2025 Leagues Cup. Martínez opened the scoring with a penalty in the 38th minute and, after Tigres equalized, secured the win with a skillful individual effort in the second half. The result leaves the Mexican club, Tigres, on the brink of elimination from the tournament, as their advancement now depends on an unlikely combination of other results. Despite the win, LAFC's chances of advancing to the next round also remain slim.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a spectacular return to the Los Angeles Dodgers' lineup, driving in four runs and hitting two home runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The veteran slugger's performance provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had struggled offensively during his month-long absence due to a knee injury. Muncy's comeback, which occurred two weeks ahead of schedule, was a significant boost, and his powerful hitting helped lead the Dodgers to their first double-digit scoring game since late June. Other previously slumping hitters, including Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández, also contributed to the offensive explosion.</p>

Kelsey Plum led the Sparks with 25 points and 11 assists, as the now-healthy Los Angeles roster demonstrated its playoff potential by winning for the seventh time in eight games. The game was briefly interrupted in the second quarter when a sex toy was thrown onto the court near an Indiana player, the third such incident in the WNBA in a week.

The potential deal would allow current and former employees to sell their shares and reflects the company's soaring valuation since the launch of ChatGPT.

          <p>China is facing a shortage of available rockets, which is creating a bottleneck for its ambitious plans to build massive satellite internet constellations to compete with services like SpaceX's Starlink. The state-backed Guo Wang project appears to be receiving priority, having launched three batches of satellites in the past week using different Long March rockets. This has left other major projects, like the Shanghai-based Qianfan constellation, turning to private rocket companies to meet their deployment schedules. The competition for limited launch capacity highlights a growing tension between national strategic priorities and the goals of various commercial and local space initiatives within the country.</p>

          <p>With the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, there is a growing urgency to preserve the first-person accounts of the aging survivors, known as "hibakusha." The average age of the just over 99,000 remaining survivors is now 86. This article highlights the efforts of individuals and organizations to ensure these stories are not lost, such as a 12-year-old boy in Hiroshima who guides foreign tourists and shares his great-grandmother's story of survival and subsequent death from cancer. These "successors" aim to convey the true horror of the attacks to new generations, hoping the lessons of the past can prevent future use of nuclear weapons.</p>
