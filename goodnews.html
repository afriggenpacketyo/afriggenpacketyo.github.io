His agenda also includes scheduled meetings with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Scotland's First Minister John Swinney. The visit, which involves a major security operation, has been met with protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, while Trump prepares to open a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire estate before returning to Washington.</p>

          <p>The BBC and ITV have successfully secured the joint broadcasting rights for the 2027 Women's World Cup, which will be held in Brazil. This partnership ensures that the premier tournament in women's football will remain available free-to-air for audiences across the United Kingdom. The broadcasters will divide the coverage of the group and knockout stages, with both networks airing the final, reflecting the sport's significant and unprecedented growth in popularity and commercial interest.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market has surged to record highs, a surprising trend given the widespread anxiety among businesses and consumers about massive tariffs threatened by the Trump administration. This apparent contradiction is fueled by a resilient economy with low unemployment, better-than-expected corporate profits, and a growing investor belief that the president’s aggressive tariff rhetoric may not fully translate into action. However, market experts remain cautious, warning that the economy could still slow down and that stocks are priced for perfection, making them vulnerable to a significant pullback.

          <p>Following Paramount's decision to cancel 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' prominent comedians have launched a powerful satirical response, questioning the stated financial motivations behind the move. Jon Stewart on 'The Daily Show' and the creators of 'South Park' delivered pointed critiques of corporate censorship and self-censorship in the face of political pressure. Colbert himself has also joined the pushback, using his monologues to mock the decision and reaffirm his commitment to uninhibited commentary, highlighting a moment of significant defiance from satirists within the media landscape.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Explores Jackie Kennedy's Concerns Over Marilyn Monroe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author J. Randy Taraborrelli claims that while Jackie Kennedy was aware of her husband's infidelities, she viewed Marilyn Monroe as a unique threat, allegedly warning JFK that the actress 'could be trouble.' The book delves into this dynamic, suggesting Jackie deliberately missed the 1962 birthday event where Monroe famously sang to the president. However, Taraborrelli also casts doubt on the long-rumored affair between JFK and Monroe, citing a lack of credible evidence and testimony from Monroe's close friend and publicist, Pat Newcomb.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming third round of US-China trade talks will be held in Stockholm, a neutral venue that signals a shift in diplomatic strategy between the world's two largest economies. Analysts suggest this choice reflects a desire for a more level playing field, moving away from dialogues held during the first Trump administration. The selection of neutral European locations, including previous talks in Geneva and London, indicates a new, more balanced approach to these high-stakes negotiations, highlighting Sweden's trusted international role in fostering dialogue and cooperation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints from new residential developments. The proposed reforms would require developers building near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing measures, aiming to reverse the decline in the pub industry. The plan, which also seeks to fast-track permissions for new businesses and al fresco dining, is intended to bring vibrancy to struggling towns, though it has drawn criticism from political opponents regarding its broader economic context.</p>
