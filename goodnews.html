        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vance Boelter, 57, has been apprehended in connection with the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. The arrest occurred near Boelter's farm in Green Isle, Minnesota, concluding a 43-hour manhunt. Boelter is accused of fatally shooting State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and of attacking Senator John Hoffman and his wife. Authorities believe Boelter disguised himself as a police officer to gain entry to the lawmakers' homes and found a target list of dozens of Minnesota Democrats in his vehicle, which led authorities to believe he was in the area. The suspect surrendered without incident and is currently being interviewed at an undisclosed police facility. Optimism that the person responsible for these crimes has been captured is high.</p>

          <p>Staff at Rowcroft Hospice in Torquay, Devon, share their thoughts on the assisted dying bill currently being debated in England and Wales. The bill would allow terminally ill adults with six months or less to live the right to medically end their lives. Many staff members expressed uncertainty about the bill's potential impact on hospice services and voiced concerns about funding shortages for palliative care. While some support patient autonomy in end-of-life decisions, others worry about potential pressure on patients to choose assisted death and the need for improved palliative care funding. The need for informed choices for patients is paramount as the debate continues.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos experienced a significant surge after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC).

Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. The acquisition would grant the consortium control over Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in PNG LNG and Papua LNG. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from reactive to preemptive cyber defense, urging the private sector to protect key systems and sensitive data amidst growing threats from state-backed hackers. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to develop a new cybersecurity strategy by the end of the year, aiming for a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027. NEC Corp. is developing AI-driven cybersecurity systems, and private organizations are encouraged to adopt practices like two-step logins and microsegmentation to improve defenses.

          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies and the "618" e-commerce event, as well as a rise in foreign tourists.

However, industrial output slowed to 5.8% and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, with property investment contracting by 10.7%.

          <h2>Dodgers Triumph After Trade Disrupts Giants</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Francisco Giants after a pregame trade disrupted the Giants' lineup. The Giants learned of a trade involving Rafael Devers for Kyle Harrison just before the game, forcing a last-minute pitching change. Despite the disruption, the Dodgers secured a 5-4 victory, with Andy Pages hitting a three-run home run. The Dodgers' rotation is uncertain as Roki Sasaki's return is delayed due to a shoulder issue.</p>

          <p>Blaise Metreweli has been appointed as the first female chief of MI6 in its 116-year history. She will take over from Sir Richard Moore later this year and is currently responsible for technology and innovation at the service. The Prime Minister called the appointment "historic" at a time when the work of our intelligence services has never been more vital. Metreweli has held director-level roles in MI5 and spent most of her career working in the Middle East and Europe.</p>
