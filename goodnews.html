          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, was found alive after surviving for weeks by foraging for wild leeks and melting snow for water. Slaton recounted being trapped by an avalanche and immobilized by a fall, during which she splinted her leg and reset her knee. Unable to call for help due to a lack of cell service, she relied on her nutrition knowledge and foraging skills to survive, using manzanita and pine needles for tea. The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort discovered her in a cabin, marking the end of her harrowing ordeal.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated on Saturday with the assistance of the UNHCR. The returnees, mostly women and children, crossed the border in buses provided by Rwandan authorities. The repatriation effort aims to bring home 2,000 people amid ongoing violence in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed rebels have seized key parts of the region. Many of the refugees were born in Congo and are returning to a homeland they have never known.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation amid a changing global landscape. A summit is planned in London to announce a defense and security agreement, aiming to strengthen military security in Europe as the U.S. potentially reduces its commitment. Discussions will also address easing food trade regulations and deepening energy collaboration. The overarching theme is navigating a world where the U.S. is pulling back, making cooperation key despite previous economic divisions.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fiber-optic gyroscope that offers improved stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, enhances the accuracy of inertial navigation systems, which do not rely on external signals and are therefore immune to interference. This innovation could have significant implications for military and security applications, as well as autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>High demand for live performances in China is fueling a surge in tourism spending, as fans travel across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel stays, dining, and tourist attractions to boost domestic consumption. Shily Zhou, an advertising professional, has traveled twice in five months to see her favorite singer, taking advantage of concert ticket discounts for local attractions. This trend underscores the growing importance of domestic consumption in China's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating from dry soils in central Illinois, created dramatic scenes in Chicago, reducing visibility at Midway International Airport. Meteorologists attributed the event to strong winds generated by thunderstorms, lifting dust from parched farmland, and noted that such occurrences are uncommon in the region.</p>
