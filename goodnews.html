          <p>Former LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne humorously responded to a social media user who mocked a viral photo of her with sweaty armpits. The picture was taken while she was anxiously watching her boyfriend, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes, play against the Cincinnati Reds. When a TikTok user commented, "You pit the ‘pit’ in Pittsburgh," Dunne quipped back, "You’d break a sweat too being a Pirates fan." Her reply references the team's recent struggles, as they have not reached the playoffs since 2015, adding a layer of witty self-awareness to her comeback.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market saw a turbulent week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq ending with minor losses despite early record highs. Investor focus was on mixed economic signals, including a drop in jobless claims and a strong revision of Q2 GDP, which tempered expectations for further Federal Reserve rate cuts. A major market event was Nvidia's announcement of a $100 billion investment in OpenAI to build AI data centers, signaling the long-term potential of the artificial intelligence sector. Other notable company news included strong iPhone 17 sales boosting Apple and the FAA loosening delivery restrictions for Boeing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1960s British band The Zombies are finally receiving widespread recognition decades after their initial success, a journey detailed in a recent profile. The band's first hit, "She's Not There," topped charts in 1964, but sustained success proved elusive, leading them to break up before their album "Odessey and Oracle" became a cult classic. A track from that album, "Time of the Season," unexpectedly became a major hit a full year after its release, solidifying their legacy. Now, over 50 years later, the surviving members have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, celebrating their influential and timeless music.</p>

          <h2>China Develops 'Pull' System to Revolutionize Mass Production of Rockets and Satellites</h2>

          <p>China is developing an industrial 'pull' system to mass-produce rockets and satellites, modeling its approach on modern automotive manufacturing. This method aims to create space systems with consistent quality, lower costs, and greater flexibility by having final assembly 'pull' components from suppliers only when needed. This contrasts with the traditional 'push' system, which relies on forecasts and often leads to delays and excess inventory. As global space activity is projected to grow exponentially, Chinese researchers believe mastering this scalable production model will be key to dominating the future of the space industry.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in U.S. shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national shopping center vacancy rate increasing, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate favorable rents and lease terms in previously unaffordable locations. This trend is helping to revitalize commercial corridors by replacing cookie-cutter chains with unique local enterprises that can create a distinct community experience. Experts note this shift allows entrepreneurs to test physical locations without significant financial risk, fostering local economic regeneration.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement are confidential. Dominion sued the former New York mayor and Trump lawyer in 2021, alleging he made numerous defamatory statements claiming the company's voting machines were rigged. This marks Dominion's third major settlement related to 2020 election lies, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News and a $67 million settlement with Newsmax. Giuliani's promotion of election conspiracies has also led to his disbarment in New York and Washington D.C.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets prevent people from increasing their income, even when they desire to earn more. The first limiting belief is feeling ashamed for not already knowing how to make more money, which prevents individuals from seeking help or learning new skills. Another is the false expectation that success should come easily, leading to discouragement when faced with inevitable challenges. Finally, the habit of procrastination, telling oneself they will start "later," allows years to pass without taking meaningful action, ultimately undermining long-term financial goals and ambitions.</p>

The plan aims to stimulate economic growth and address the nation's housing crisis, drawing inspiration from the post-war Labour government's new town developments.

Other debunked beliefs include the idea that you will inevitably be lonely, that life abroad is perfect without challenges like bureaucracy, and that it's too late in life to make such a significant move.</p>

          <p>The rate of civilian fire deaths in the United States has dramatically decreased by approximately two-thirds since 1980, showcasing significant progress in urban safety. This reduction is attributed to an accumulation of small but crucial improvements in technology and regulation. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased installation of automatic sprinkler systems, and the implementation of safer standards for furniture and electrical wiring. Additionally, a significant decline in cigarette smoking and the requirement for "fire-safe" cigarettes have drastically reduced the number of smoking-related home fires, saving countless lives.</p>

Supporters argue it will streamline online bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears that it could undermine privacy and be used for tracking.
