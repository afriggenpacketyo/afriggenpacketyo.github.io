          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams won a libel case against the BBC regarding a 2016 news story. The story included an anonymous allegation that Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a British agent. Adams has consistently denied any involvement in Donaldson's murder. The court's decision supports Adams's claim that the BBC's broadcast and online article defamed him, thereby vindicating his reputation.</p>

          <p>Banksy's latest graffiti art, a lighthouse stencilled on a wall, has been traced to a street in Marseille, France. The artwork includes the words, "I want to be what you saw in me."

Banksy's Instagram account is used to authenticate his works, often imbued with political messages on immigration, war, and homelessness.

          <p>Elon Musk has concluded his tenure as a "special government employee," and US President Donald Trump announced an Oval Office press event to bid the Tesla billionaire farewell. Musk claimed his cost-cutting measures at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) saved taxpayers $160 billion (‚Ç¨141 billion), although the sum has been questioned. Democrats have argued that Elon Musk and DOGE lack the authority to make such spending cuts.

Lagarde emphasized the need for Europe to maintain open trade, reinforce its economic foundation, and bolster its legal foundation to enhance the euro's global influence. A stronger euro would bring benefits to Europe, including lower borrowing costs and protection from sanctions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article explores the nature of animal instincts, using the example of the common tailorbird, known for sewing leaves together to create nests. The article questions whether this behavior is instinctual or learned. It references a neuroscientist who argues against a simple definition of instinct, preferring the term "species-typical" behavior. The piece emphasizes the complex interplay of genetics, environment, and learning in shaping animal behaviors, suggesting that behaviors grow up in bodies under environmental experiences and explicit learning.</p>

This follows Trump's earlier opposition to Nippon's acquisition bid, which was blocked by former President Joe Biden on national security grounds. The agreement includes provisions for an American CEO, a U.S.-majority board, and a golden share requiring U.S. government approval of board members to ensure production levels.</p>
