          <p>Frederick M. Nicholas, a real estate developer, attorney, and decorated WWII veteran who was a pivotal figure in shaping Los Angeles's cultural landscape, has died at the age of 105. Known as "Mr. Downtown Culture," he was instrumental in the development of major institutions like the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) and the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Nicholas also founded Public Counsel in 1970, which grew to become the nation's largest pro bono law firm, providing legal aid to vulnerable populations.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 521,000 Haitian immigrants before its scheduled February expiration. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan ruled that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acted unlawfully by not following the congressionally mandated process for reconsidering Haiti's TPS designation. The lawsuit was filed by Haitian TPS holders and advocacy groups, who argued the administration failed to review the current dangerous conditions in Haiti, where gang violence has displaced over a million people. The administration has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on Tuesday that Israel has agreed to the terms of a 60-day ceasefire proposal aimed at pausing the war in Gaza. In a post on Truth Social, the president urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating that conditions will only worsen for them otherwise. The specifics of the proposal were not detailed, and neither Israeli nor Hamas officials have publicly commented on the announcement. The potential breakthrough comes after previous ceasefire negotiations have stalled, and it precedes a scheduled meeting between President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington.</p>

Despite backlash from some former players, he emphasized the importance of using his platform to inspire the next generation.

          <p>A new medical technology using powerful, specialized magnets is transforming battlefield medicine in Ukraine by enabling surgeons to safely and quickly remove shrapnel from complex wounds. With shrapnel injuries from drone warfare now accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma, these magnetic extractors allow for minimally invasive procedures, even on delicate organs like the heart. Developed by a volunteer team in response to needs from front-line medics, the devices have been used in thousands of successful operations. This innovation is considered a game-changer for treating fragmentation wounds, which are notoriously difficult and time-consuming to address.</p>

CEO Dylan Field stated that going public would allow the company's community to share in its ownership and that investors should expect Figma to make bold moves, including further acquisitions.

The analysis suggests Microsoft's success was driven by strong growth in its Azure cloud business. Nvidia overcame early-year concerns, rallying due to the persistent high demand for its superior AI semiconductor technology. Meta's outperformance was attributed to its powerful advertising capabilities, which helped it surpass earnings estimates and recover from a broader market dip. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this stability, experts warn of emerging challenges in the second half of the year. While diversified trade partnerships have offset declining shipments to the U.S., some analysts forecast that export growth will slow or even contract.

          <p>California has passed its most significant reform to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) in decades, a move intended to spur housing construction. The new legislation, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, largely waives CEQA's extensive environmental review process for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas. This change eliminates a tool that both community advocates and project opponents have used to delay or block development through lengthy studies and lawsuits. While hurdles like interest rates and labor costs remain, the reform marks a seismic shift in state politics away from development barriers.</p>

          <p>An Argentine tegu, a large invasive lizard species, was spotted by hikers and subsequently captured in Joseph D. Grant County Park near San Jos√©, California. Park officials issued a warning to the public, advising them to keep a safe distance if they saw the lizard, which can grow up to five feet long. While not a direct threat to humans, tegus are a serious danger to local ecosystems as they prey on the eggs of native birds, snakes, and tortoises. The captured lizard was likely an escaped or released pet, highlighting the risks of non-native animal ownership.</p>
