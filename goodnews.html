          <p>Erling Haaland delivered a commanding performance, scoring two goals to lead Manchester City to a 3-0 victory over rival Manchester United. The 25-year-old striker was praised for his complete game, contributing significantly on both offense and defense, including making six crucial clearances to thwart United's attacks. Manager Pep Guardiola stated that Haaland is "better than ever" this season, even surpassing his form during the team's Treble-winning year. Haaland's prolific goal-scoring continues to fuel speculation about his potential to break the Premier League's all-time scoring record held by Alan Shearer.</p>

McCaul, who has chaired both the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security Committees, stated he will serve out his current term but is seeking a "new challenge" in the national security field. A staunch advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine, he recently led an investigation into the American withdrawal from Afghanistan. His departure adds to a number of retirements from the House as lawmakers seek other offices or new career paths.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of President Donald Trump and Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to continue his studies at New York University's campus in Washington, D.C. This move places him closer to his parents while he is enrolled in the university's selective D.C. program, which integrates coursework with professional internships related to government and public policy. While his major was previously listed under the NYU Stern School of Business, his transfer to the politics-focused D.C. campus has sparked speculation about a potential shift in his academic and career interests toward the political arena.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury’s has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise chain, Argos. The decision was made after JD.com reportedly sought to engage on a "materially revised set of terms and commitments." Sainsbury's concluded that the new proposal was not in the best interest of its shareholders and therefore terminated the discussions. Despite the collapse of the deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial outlook, stating it still expects to achieve an underlying retail operating profit of approximately £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star Saquon Barkley has reportedly invested millions of his nearly $80 million in NFL career earnings into a diverse portfolio of tech startups and venture capital funds. Following a strategy to live off endorsement deals while investing his salary, Barkley has backed companies like AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This approach was partly motivated by a significant injury in 2020, which reminded him of the finite nature of an NFL career. His investments reflect a calculated effort to build long-term generational wealth beyond his time on the football field. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the UK's Labour Party, delivering a speech in Sunderland that stressed the importance of unity. She urged the party to come together to secure a second term in government and effectively combat the rise of the Reform UK party. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue her active campaigning role if elected. Her main rival in the contest is former Commons leader Lucy Powell, with the election seen by some as a test of the Prime Minister's leadership.</p>
