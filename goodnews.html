          <p>Amid rising Halloween costume prices, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families by creating and donating costumes for free. For nine years, he has been sourcing materials from thrift stores, using his creativity to wash, sew, and redesign them into unique outfits for children. With the average cost of a single costume increasing by 11% this year to over $37, Waggoner's initiative provides a crucial service for families facing financial constraints. He spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on the project but feels the reward is in helping children experience the joy of the holiday, regardless of their family's financial situation.</p>

          <p>Nathan Thomas, a sophomore at Jefferson County High School, is working to combat youth apathy in politics by creating a Youth City Council in Wrens, Georgia. He presented a plan to the Wrens City Council for a youth-led body that would mirror the structure of the actual council, with a mayor and council members. Thomas believes this initiative will give the city's large youth population a positive and active voice in community events and local governance. His long-term goal is to use the Wrens model to establish a similar youth commission at the county level, fostering future leaders for the community and beyond.</p>

          <p>An Invesco senior portfolio manager recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies to manage recent market volatility. These funds can offer more reliable downside protection and provide income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is relevant as policymakers are expected to cut rates. The manager notes a significant "tailwind" for such strategies, suggesting that the demand for income and defense against equity drawdowns is a persistent need for many portfolios. The article advises investors to seek ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and be cautious of unsustainable yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager for commitment, a recent study by DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute found that men are more likely to want to accelerate relationship timelines. The study of 2,000 U.S. singles revealed that 28.6% of men would move in with a partner sooner and 18.8% would marry sooner, compared to 18.8% and 13.7% of women, respectively. Researchers suggest that financial savings are a key motivator, but also note that men often rely more heavily on romantic relationships for their primary social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when they are single.</p>

          <p>Repair work has commenced to restore the main external power supply to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces established special ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs. The plant, which is Europe's largest and currently under Russian control, requires a stable power source to cool its reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines to the plant have needed restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles-based group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth is creating a safe space for Black men to address their mental health, a critical need given rising suicide rates in this demographic. Founded by Desmond Carter, the bi-monthly meetings in Leimert Park allow men to be vulnerable and discuss issues like stress, depression, and the pressures of masculinity without judgment. Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often face substandard care due to systemic disparities. Initiatives like Carter's serve as a vital preventative measure, aiming to break generational cycles and foster emotional expression in a supportive community.</p>

The selection, organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, reflects the growing influence of English and a trend toward brevity in youth language.

Despite pushback from the state's attorney general and secretary of state, volunteers say they have already gathered most of the required signatures.

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media contributes to better mental health and future success. She recommends that parents begin teaching responsible technology use at least six years before giving a child a device, ideally in late elementary school. Key lessons include discussing online privacy, understanding the value of time spent offline, and setting firm rules, such as no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge also suggests that a child's first phone should be a basic, non-internet-connected device to help them build healthy habits before engaging with the complexities of the online world.</p>
