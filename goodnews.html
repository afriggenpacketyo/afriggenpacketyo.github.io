          <p>Proxima Fusion, a German startup, has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round to develop a commercial nuclear fusion power plant. This represents the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date, highlighting growing interest in fusion energy as a potential solution for the energy transition. Nuclear fusion, the process powering the sun and stars, promises virtually limitless clean and affordable energy if replicated at an industrial scale. While challenges remain in scaling the technology for commercial use, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade. This advancement could significantly shift global energy dependence from natural resources to technological leadership.</p>

          <p>A court ruling ordering the Tokyo government and the state to compensate a company president and others for an unlawful investigation has been finalized after the parties gave up appealing. Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two others will receive about 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages, recognizing their arrests and indictments as illegal. The case involved the export of spray-drying apparatus suspected of being used in biological weapons production. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation, with a Tokyo police investigator testifying that the case was "fabricated." The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry had questioned the police's legal interpretation, but the police proceeded with the arrests anyway. This outcome highlights the importance of accountability and oversight in law enforcement.</p>

However, Orcel indicated that UniCredit would not proceed with an acquisition offer at a premium to Commerzbank's current share value, citing a lack of value for UniCredit's investors.

Researchers are working to identify the soldiers, with possible matches narrowed down to men from Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Virginia regiments.
