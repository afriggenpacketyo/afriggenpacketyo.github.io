          <p>A White House proposal to rescind funding for public broadcasting is facing resistance from some Senate Republicans. These senators are particularly concerned about the impact on rural and tribal radio stations, which often serve as the sole source for local news and critical emergency alerts. The debate highlights a divide over the value of public media, especially for remote communities that rely on it for safety information amid natural disasters like recent floods.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump over 12% after reinstating its 2025 profit outlook and signaling a stronger-than-anticipated summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings have stabilized after an earlier dip, the full-year earnings forecast remains below initial projections from January. The airline's positive performance was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its partnership with American Express, highlighting a reliance on less price-sensitive travelers.

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high of over $113,000, continuing its recent upward momentum. The rally is being fueled by a broader investor shift into risk assets and a significant volume of short liquidations, where traders betting against the cryptocurrency were forced to buy back in. Other cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, also saw gains, following a period of relative stagnation despite large inflows into bitcoin-related investment products. (not investment advice)</p>

Told through the eyes of a 7-year-old white girl named Bobo, the film captures the tension and violence of the era from a raw, childish perspective.

          <p>This article explores how annuities can serve as a strategic tool in retirement planning, working in tandem with Social Security benefits. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security, which significantly increases their monthly benefit amount. This combination can create a more stable financial foundation, helping to cover essential expenses and manage tax liabilities on retirement income, providing greater peace of mind.

          <p>This article delves into the concept of "middlebrow," using a fiery 1932 letter by Virginia Woolf as a starting point. Woolf championed "highbrow" art and had an appreciation for "lowbrow" life, but reserved special contempt for the "middlebrow," which she saw as a dishonest, fashion-driven consumer of smoothed-out art. The essay reflects on how this term has evolved, now often referring to anything perceived as harmlessly pedestrian, and explores the ongoing cultural debates about taste.</p>
