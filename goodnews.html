          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts, William Young, delivered a scathing 161-page decision, ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio unconstitutionally targeted pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. The judge found that these actions, which included deploying masked agents and misusing immigration laws, were designed to instill fear and suppress lawful free speech on college campuses. Young further issued a sharp rebuke to President Trump, criticizing his "palpable misunderstanding" of free speech and asserting that the judiciary has robustly rebuffed such infringements. This article highlights a significant legal challenge to executive power and the protection of First Amendment rights for non-citizens.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act, into law, mandating that developers of powerful AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini publish safety and security reports. This legislation specifically targets "catastrophic risks," defined as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled biological weapons or cyberattacks. The article explains that the law also requires companies to report critical safety incidents within 15 days and establishes whistleblower protections. While some critics argue it may not prevent major disasters, proponents believe it sets a crucial precedent for regulating fast-evolving AI technology and fostering a "race to the top" in safety.</p>

          <p>California-based startup Aetherflux is pushing the boundaries of "science fiction" by testing low-orbit satellites designed to collect solar power in space and beam it wirelessly to Earth using infrared lasers. Backed by investors like Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, the company plans to launch its first satellite constellation on a SpaceX rocket next year. This article details Aetherflux's initial focus on providing power for the U.S. Department of Defense, solving the problem of vulnerable diesel generators in battlefields. The long-term goal is to scale the technology to be cost-competitive, with other entities globally, including China, also exploring similar space-based solar farm concepts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike posted a surprise 1% sales growth in its fiscal first quarter, reaching $11.72 billion, which surpassed expectations of a mid-single-digit decline. Despite this positive revenue performance, the company's reported net income dropped 31% year-over-year to $727 million, and its gross margin fell 3.2 percentage points to 42.2%. This article explains that the margin decline was primarily driven by steep discounts and higher tariffs, signaling that Nike's ongoing efforts to clear old inventory are still impacting profitability. The mixed results suggest that while sales are improving, the sneaker giant's comprehensive turnaround work remains a significant challenge. (not investment advice)</p>
