          <p>In a New York Times guest essay, Patti Davis reflects on her father Ronald Reagan's Alzheimer's diagnosis and encourages Joe Biden to share his personal experiences with prostate cancer to foster understanding and trust. Davis emphasizes that Biden's openness could transcend political divides and offer comfort to others facing similar health challenges. She suggests that by being candid about his feelings and contemplating mortality, Biden can add a meaningful chapter to his legacy and restore trust with voters who may feel he was not honest about his fitness for a second term. The article suggests that Biden's vulnerability could be a source of strength and connection with the American people, fostering a sense of shared humanity.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share ideological similarities as outsiders challenging the political establishment. The article claims that both men acted on conservative ideas and enjoyed popularity with blue-collar voters. Reagan's stance against the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate certain government departments are compared to Trump's policies. The author asserts that the Republican Party has embraced issues such as tax cuts, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance, all centered on the importance of the individual, due to the influence of both Reagan and Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China cut a key reference rate for mortgage loans by 10 basis points on Tuesday amid efforts to stabilise the property market, but analysts said the moderate cut was still insufficient to revive a sector mired in a downturn. The five-year loan prime rate (LPR), which commercial banks use as a benchmark for their mortgage rates, was lowered from 3.6 per cent to 3.5 per cent, according to the People‚Äôs Bank of China. The one-year loan prime rate, the reference rate for corporate loans, was also cut by 0.1 percentage points to 3.0 per cent. The reduction followed the central bank‚Äôs announcement earlier this month to cut the seven-day reverse repo rate ‚Äì a benchmark interest rate ‚Äì by 10 basis points to 1.4 per cent, which central bank governor Pan Gongsheng said would likely lead to a similar drop in the mortgage reference rate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR article details how NASA engineers successfully revived Voyager 1's primary roll thrusters after they had been dormant for two decades, averting a potential loss of contact with the spacecraft. The switch to the backup thrusters happened when controllers noticed that heater switches in the primary system had turned off on their own, signaling a possible fault. The decision to reactivate the primary thrusters was made as the backup system showed signs of weakening and a critical ground-based radio antenna was scheduled to go offline for upgrades. This remote fix ensures Voyager 1 can continue its mission of exploring interstellar space and transmitting valuable data, with the Voyager team remaining optimistic about keeping the spacecraft operational long enough to celebrate their 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

The article notes the absence of established superstars like Steph Curry and LeBron James in this round, paving the way for a younger generation of players like Jalen Brunson, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, and Anthony Edwards. The article emphasizes the wide-open nature of the playoffs and the opportunistic mindset of the remaining teams.</p>

          <p>Kyodo News reports that the Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. The research aims to accelerate decarbonization, as marine vegetation absorbs more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will commission studies on seaweed behavior and the environmental impact of carbon capture and storage projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>
