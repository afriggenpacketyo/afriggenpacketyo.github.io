          <p>During President Trump's state visit to Riyadh, Saudis shared varied opinions on his leadership, with some praising his directness and conservative values while others criticized his economic policies. Some Saudis expressed admiration for Trump's approach to Middle East policy, including the removal of sanctions on Syria, and his stance on social issues. However, others voiced concerns about his economic impact and perceived harm to the American people, with one individual simply stating their dislike due to Trump being American. The article highlights the complex and diverse perspectives within Saudi Arabia regarding the American president.</p>

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications have agreed to merge in a deal valued at approximately $34.5 billion, aiming to create one of the largest TV and internet providers in the United States. The merger, which requires antitrust approval, is positioned as a way for the companies to better compete with larger national broadband and satellite service providers. Charter and Cox emphasized the deal's potential to bring customer-service jobs back to America and to expand local news coverage, which may help to gain approval from the Trump administration. The combined company will operate under the Cox name and offer services under the Spectrum brand.</p>

          <p>A Fox News article criticizes Bruce Springsteen and Robert De Niro for disparaging President Trump overseas while highlighting the Kennedy Center's thriving arts scene. The author contrasts the artists' negative portrayal of America with the positive experiences of Americans attending performances at the Kennedy Center. The article emphasizes the Kennedy Center's focus on providing art that unites rather than divides, contrasting this with what the author perceives as progressive indoctrination. The piece concludes by encouraging readers to support artists who speak to their souls, not their politics.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, announced that its CEO, Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, will step down due to recent market challenges and a decline in the company's share price. The company's stock has fallen significantly due to increased competition in the weight-loss drug market, particularly from Eli Lilly's Zepbound and compounded replica drugs. Jorgensen will remain in his position to support a smooth transition, and the company is actively searching for a successor. This change comes as Novo Nordisk faces pressure to maintain its position in the rapidly evolving market for weight-loss treatments.</p>

          <p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is facing increasing legal challenges in Africa over data privacy violations, with Nigeria issuing substantial fines and lawyers preparing a lawsuit related to content moderator working conditions in Ghana. These legal actions could set precedents for other African countries seeking to hold global tech giants accountable for data protection. Experts suggest that these cases could serve as a playbook for other countries, influencing the development of regulatory frameworks for tech platforms on the continent. There are concerns about governments using digital regulation to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>Thames Water and other water companies may be prevented from paying bonuses under new rules set to be implemented by the industry regulator, Ofwat. The Environment Secretary stated the new measures aim to prevent water companies from polluting rivers while awarding themselves millions in bonuses. Ofwat's new powers, contained in the Water (Special Measures) Act, will enable it to ban undeserved bonuses when environmental and financial standards are not met, and could even claw back bonuses paid in the last financial year. Thames Water, however, argues that the upcoming payments are "retention payments" rather than performance-related bonuses.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a new temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, aimed at helping retirees keep more money in their pockets. This "bonus" is an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, which President Trump and other lawmakers have discussed. The proposal provides an additional deduction for adults ages 65 and over, applicable to tax years 2025 through 2028, but it phases out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000. While it reduces the amount of income subject to taxes, it is less generous than a tax credit.</p>

          <p>In far northern California, a region with strong support for President Trump, voters are expressing concern over the rapid pace and scale of federal cuts, despite generally backing his agenda. Officials in Shasta County, for example, sent a letter to the federal government expressing concern about potential layoffs affecting the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area. While support for Trump's policies remains strong among Republicans, the potential impact of these cuts on rural communities, which rely heavily on federal support for various services, is causing unease. The region is highly dependent on federal support for services.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz described his nearly four-year, $25 million journey to list crypto firm Galaxy Digital on the Nasdaq as "unfair, infuriating," due to regulatory hurdles. The process, which typically takes 45 to 90 days, stretched to 1,320 days and required nine rounds of comments with the SEC. Novogratz noted that Galaxy's auditing costs were significantly higher than those of traditional firms due to regulatory scrutiny, but he expects these fees to decrease now that the company is listed. Despite the challenges, the ordeal strengthened Galaxy, which funded its operations through investment gains and trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is complicated and potentially unfeasible due to the global automotive supply chain, as well as the price of sourcing domestically. Experts say the investments and costs would increase exponentially, making vehicles unaffordable for many consumers. While President Trump has pressured automakers to increase U.S. production through tariffs, many parts and materials are cheaper to manufacture overseas. The average new-car price of a U.S.-assembled vehicle is already more than $53,200, compared to roughly $40,700 in Mexico, for example. (not investment advice)</p>
