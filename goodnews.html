          <p>A federal appeals court has partially granted a stay, allowing the Trump administration to restrict the Associated Press' access to the Oval Office and other restricted areas of the White House. The 2-1 ruling favored the administration's argument that these spaces are not public forums and the White House retains discretion over which journalists are admitted. The dissenting judge warned that this decision could erode press independence and allow for the exclusion of journalists based on viewpoint. This ruling reverses a lower court's decision that deemed the ban unconstitutional, granting the White House more control over press access.</p>

          <p>Former NFL offensive lineman Taylor Lewan experienced a disastrous first pitch at a St. Louis Cardinals game, throwing the ball far off course. Reacting with humor and self-deprecation, Lewan threw his hat to the ground and did pushups, acknowledging it as the worst day of his athletic career. Lewan, a three-time Pro Bowler, compared the event to a game where he struggled against Chandler Jones. Despite the poor performance, Lewan vowed to improve and achieve redemption in the future.</p>

The lawsuit questions whether DOGE must comply with federal public records law, and the Supreme Court has sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings. The court's order prevents DOGE from having to disclose records related to its work and personnel, as well as preventing its acting administrator from having to answer questions at a deposition.

The conflict erupted after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to Trump suggesting the termination of Musk's government subsidies and contracts.
