          <p>The U.S. Senate advanced a package of three government funding bills late Friday, breaking a partisan stalemate and taking a step toward avoiding a potential government shutdown. The bills, which include funding for military construction, veterans' affairs, and agriculture, will now proceed to the House, where they face opposition from Republicans over spending levels. The passage marks a victory for Senate leadership and is the first time since 2018 the chamber has passed appropriations bills before September. The move comes as Congress faces a September 30 deadline to fund the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles-based band Ozomatli, known for its social activism, is scheduled to perform at a large-scale protest at Grand Park this Saturday. The performance is intended to oppose authoritarianism and show solidarity with immigrants, workers, and communities of color. The group has a long history of participating in social protests, viewing music as a powerful tool for mobilization and truth-telling. Recently, they released a new song, "Red Line," as a tribute to the working class who rely on public transportation, reinforcing their commitment to social and political causes.</p>

          <p>Relations between India and China appear to be improving after five years of diplomatic tension following a deadly border clash. Recent positive steps include New Delhi resuming the issuance of visas to Chinese citizens and Beijing allowing Indian pilgrims to return to Tibet. Direct flights, suspended since the pandemic, are also expected to resume soon, signaling a potential for deeper cooperation between the two Asian economic powers. However, analysts caution that the unresolved and contentious Himalayan border dispute remains a significant obstacle to a full normalization of their relationship.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several moves before the trade deadline to improve their roster, acquiring right-handed relief pitchers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase and versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that while not blockbuster acquisitions, these additions "raise the floor" for the first-place team. Stewart, a former Dodger, returns as a high-leverage reliever with increased velocity, while Call is expected to provide depth in the outfield. The front office hopes these moves will complement improved performance from the team's existing star players during the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <h2>ByteDance Reveals Median Employee Tenure of Nearly Three Years</h2>

          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, disclosed at an internal town hall meeting that the median service length for its current 120,000 employees is 2.9 years. The Beijing-based social media giant also reported that the average tenure for existing staff is three years. These figures were shared to counter online speculation that the company had a much higher turnover rate. The data suggests that ByteDance has a relatively stable workforce compared to the high-pressure "996" work culture common in China's tech industry, which the company officially abandoned in 2021 for a more standard schedule.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has indicated that recent trade negotiations with Chinese officials in Stockholm have been productive, stating on social media that the talks have advanced and that "we have the makings of a deal." While expressing optimism about the path forward, the administration has not yet confirmed specific agreements, such as an extension of the current pause on new tariff increases. The statements come after a week of meetings aimed at resolving the ongoing trade disputes between the two economic superpowers, though the U.S. side has delivered mixed messages regarding the outcomes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for tens of thousands of immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for more than 60,000 individuals who could have lost their legal status and work authorization in the coming weeks. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and has stated its intention to appeal.</p>

          <p>An Ohio woman, Tiah McCreary, is in a legal battle with a Kia dealership after a unique act of retaliation for having her car repossessed. After the repossession, McCreary discovered that Taylor Kia of Lima had failed to renew its business name registration with the state, so she registered the name for herself and sent the dealer a cease-and-desist letter. An appeals court has now ruled that her claim over the trade name is separate from the car purchase dispute and can be heard in court, rather than being forced into arbitration. The case highlights a creative consumer response.</p>

          <p>A potential reunion between veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen and the Los Angeles Chargers is reportedly under discussion. Allen, who was traded from the team last year in a salary-cap move, was scheduled to meet with the Chargers on Friday. The team is in need of an experienced receiver after the recent retirement of Mike Williams, and a return for the six-time Pro Bowl selection would provide a familiar and reliable target for quarterback Justin Herbert. Allen played 11 seasons with the franchise, becoming its longest-tenured player before his departure to the Chicago Bears.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has indicated it may rule President Trump's executive order restricting birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional, expressing strong skepticism during a hearing. Judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the Constitution's 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts that have blocked the policy. The ultimate legality of the order, a key part of Trump's immigration platform, will likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>
