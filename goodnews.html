          <p>Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Schmid has indicated hesitation regarding a widely anticipated interest rate cut in September, stating that policymakers need more definitive data on inflation. Speaking from the Jackson Hole symposium, Schmid pushed back against market expectations, suggesting the Fed still has work to do to reach its 2% inflation target. His comments introduce a note of uncertainty into monetary policy, contrasting with pressure from the White House for lower rates to stimulate the economy. Schmid is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on President Donald Trump and other defendants in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine was excessive and violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The lawsuit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, had resulted in a judge finding Trump liable for fraudulently overvaluing his assets. While the financial penalty was struck down, the court upheld the non-monetary injunctive relief measures designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has backed down from imposing high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors from the European Union as part of a new trade agreement. Previously, these sectors faced potential tariffs of up to 250%, but they will now be limited to 15%, aligning with most other goods in the deal. In return, the EU has agreed to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods. This development provides significant relief to European exporters, particularly Ireland's major pharmaceutical industry, and brings more stability to the transatlantic trade relationship after months of intense negotiations.</p>

          <p>Walmart has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook, driven by strong e-commerce growth and resilient consumer spending, though it noted that costs from tariffs are increasing. The retailer's U.S. comparable sales grew by 4.6% in the second quarter, exceeding expectations, with its online business expanding by 26%. Despite this strong performance, the company's shares fell as its adjusted earnings per share missed Wall Street estimates due to one-time expenses. Walmart's report offers a key insight into the U.S. economy, showing that consumers continue to spend even as the company navigates the financial impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study examining wolf management in the Western U.S. suggests that public wolf hunting has a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Research conducted in Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington found that killing a wolf saved only a tiny fraction of a single cow, meaning about 14 wolves would need to be killed to prevent one livestock death. The findings challenge the long-held assumption that reducing wolf populations directly curtails depredation. Researchers emphasize that the study is not about the ethics of hunting but aims to identify effective management tools to mitigate human-wildlife conflict and support ranchers.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has revealed she uses GLP-1 weight-loss medications, explaining that she turned to them after struggling to lose weight post-childbirth despite a healthy lifestyle. In a new campaign for telehealth company Ro, Williams, who has lost 31 pounds in eight months, addressed the stigma surrounding these drugs, stating that using them is a form of self-care, not a shortcut. As a celebrity ambassador for Ro, she joins other public figures like Oprah Winfrey in openly discussing their use of medications such as Ozempic and Wegovy, which have surged in popularity for weight management.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is set to sign Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze after making a late bid that trumped a competing offer from rival club Tottenham Hotspur. The move reportedly materialized quickly after an injury concern arose for Arsenal's Kai Havertz, prompting the club to act on its long-standing interest in Eze. A key factor in the decision was Eze's childhood connection to Arsenal, where he played in the academy, making the choice to join the Gunners an easy one. The transfer is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, adding a dynamic and creative forward who can provide a different attacking option.</p>

As part of the deal, the EU will purchase $40 billion in AI chips from the US and implement controls to avoid "technology leakage to destinations of concern." This alignment signals a closer transatlantic stance on technology security and commerce, potentially creating further friction in the EU's relationship with Beijing.

          <p>Police divers in Italy have performed their annual cleaning of the iconic underwater statue, "Christ of the Abyss," located on the seabed off the coast of Portofino. Using pressurized water hoses, the team carefully removed bacteria and corrosive crustaceans from the 2.5-meter bronze sculpture. The statue was placed in the Mediterranean in 1954 as a memorial for those who have died at sea and has become a major attraction for divers. Officials state that this cleaning method is environmentally safe, as it uses seawater to dislodge microorganisms without damaging the statue or the surrounding marine ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic tool for homeowners to save money. These loans can be particularly effective for consolidating high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, by converting variable-rate debt into a lower, fixed-rate payment. Another beneficial use is financing home improvements that increase a property's value, as the interest on such loans may be tax-deductible. However, experts caution against using home equity for luxury purchases or daily expenses and stress the importance of having stable income and sufficient equity before borrowing.

The academy has produced several national players, including 17-year-old star Mosammat Sagorika, helping to change local attitudes toward women in sports.

          <p>The average interest rate on a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has fallen to 4.99%, dipping below the 5% threshold for the first time since May 2023. This milestone, along with a recent drop in two-year fixed rates, signals a trend of steadily falling borrowing costs and increased competition among lenders. While the immediate financial savings for borrowers may be modest, such symbolic turning points can boost buyer confidence in the housing market. Experts note that despite this positive news, the prospect of higher-for-longer central bank rates may limit how much further mortgage rates can fall in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 2% in July compared to June, defying analyst expectations of a decline. The rise is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during the period when these contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw a minimal year-over-year increase of 0.2%, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point where affordability could slowly improve for prospective buyers.
