          <p>Mexican boxing champion Kenia Enr√≠quez has signed an exclusive contract with the MMA organization Combate Global. Enr√≠quez, who holds interim titles with the World Boxing Council (WBC), expressed deep frustration with the boxing organization for a lack of opportunities to unify her championship belts.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a "group of very wealthy people" has been found to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok. He stated that he would reveal the buyer's identity in approximately two weeks and suggested that the deal would likely require approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping. The sale is mandated by a U.S. government order aimed at addressing national security concerns over the potential for American user data to be accessed by the Chinese government. The deadline for the sale has been extended multiple times, with the current date set for September 17.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Baidu is set to make its generative AI model, Ernie, open source, a significant move in the global AI race. This decision could disrupt the market by providing a powerful, low-cost alternative to proprietary models from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Experts believe this will increase pressure on closed-source providers to justify their pricing and could accelerate AI development worldwide. While some see it as a "declaration of war on pricing," others note that Baidu may face skepticism from enterprises over security and data privacy concerns. (not investment advice)</p>
