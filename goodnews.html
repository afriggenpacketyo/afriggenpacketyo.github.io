        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were previously let go. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the department's critical functions and obligations mandated by Congress, noting that the staff cuts led to the closure of seven out of twelve offices responsible for enforcing civil rights, including protecting students from discrimination. The judge also pointed out that the entire team supervising the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was eliminated. This action follows a lawsuit filed by 21 states against the Trump administration over the staff reductions, underscoring concerns about the agency's ability to fulfill its duties. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, estimating between 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 strengthening into hurricanes and 3 to 5 becoming major hurricanes. Acting NOAA administrator Laura Grimm and National Weather Service director Ken Graham emphasized technological advancements allowing for more accurate forecasts. The forecast considers the neutral condition of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycle and the influence of warmer waters due to climate change. NOAA's forecast provides a framework for communities in storm-prone areas to prepare for the season ahead, with potential updates later in the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, with 431,000 more people arriving than leaving. This decrease was primarily driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study in the UK, following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. The drop was also influenced by large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving the country. The Home Office also reported a decrease in the number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels, although the figure remains higher than when Labour came to power.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling the Department of Education, ruling that such action requires congressional approval. Judge Myong Joun's order prevents the administration from carrying out mass firings announced in March and mandates the reinstatement of any employees already terminated. The ruling referenced Trump's previous calls to shut down the department and argued that the reduction in force was a means of achieving this goal without congressional consent. This decision follows a similar ruling where another federal judge blocked the administration from firing members of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new missile defense project called the "Golden Dome for America," aimed at protecting the U.S. from foreign missile threats. The multilayered system would involve space-based sensors and interceptors and could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. It would include detecting and destroying missiles ahead of launch, intercepting them early in flight, halting them midcourse, and stopping them in the final moments of approach. China has criticized the plan as a potential militarization of space and a catalyst for a global arms race.</p>

Mahmood is also exploring whether chemical suppression could be made mandatory, but no timeline for this decision has been set. The Liberal Democrats said the effectiveness of the voluntary approach must be studied, while an expert welcomed the extension but did not expect the mandatory element to get off the ground.</p>

The move is expected to save the Mint approximately $56 million annually. The Trump administration had signaled its intent to stop making the 1-cent coin due to rising production costs.</p>

G42 is also expected to contribute money to the construction of OpenAI data centers in the United States.
