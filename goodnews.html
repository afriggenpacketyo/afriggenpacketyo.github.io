          <p>This article emphasizes the importance of saving for future expenses and recommends high-yield savings accounts for emergency funds due to their safety and higher interest earnings compared to traditional accounts. While the national average is 0.38%, high-yield options can offer rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, with online banks often providing the best rates due to lower overheads. The article provides practical advice on choosing the best account to maximize interest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) plans to propose a radical restructuring of professional rugby in Wales, reducing the number of professional men's sides from four to two. This initiative aims to transform the struggling game, with the WRU suggesting two organizations, each fielding both men's and women's teams, with significantly elevated funding. The proposal, which includes centralizing player and staff contracts and establishing a national campus, comes amidst concerns over the Welsh men's team's poor performance and the financial struggles of the existing regions.</p>
