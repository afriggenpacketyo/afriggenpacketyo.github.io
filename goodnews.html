          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Mumbai as part of a major trade mission involving over 100 British CEOs and leaders. The visit aims to expand business ties following a landmark UK-India trade deal signed in July. The deal is set to significantly reduce tariffs on goods like Scotch whisky and luxury cars, with projections suggesting it could boost the UK's GDP by £4.8 billion annually and create thousands of jobs. During the visit, Starmer also announced that three major Bollywood films will be produced in the UK starting in 2026.</p>

          <p>China has successfully launched a groundbreaking thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring a world-first dual-tower design that enhances efficiency. The plant uses nearly 27,000 mirrors to focus sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, heating molten salt to store energy and generate continuous power, even after sunset. This innovative configuration, which allows one tower to capture morning sun and the other to capture afternoon sun, is reportedly 25% more effective than single-tower designs, marking a significant advancement in renewable energy technology.</p>

This move aligns with a broader trend of Wall Street banks exploring cryptocurrency services as the U.S. government introduces clearer regulations for the stablecoin market.

          <p>The agreement on the first phase of a Gaza peace plan has triggered widespread positive reactions from global leaders, civilians in Gaza, and families of Israeli hostages. UN Secretary-General António Guterres hailed it as a "momentous opportunity," while leaders from the UK and Australia urged all parties to uphold the deal's terms. On the ground, residents celebrated in the streets, expressing profound relief and hope that the agreement will finally bring an end to two years of devastating and deadly conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan between Israel and Hamas centers on the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a large number of Palestinian prisoners. As part of the agreement, Israel will also withdraw its troops to a pre-determined line, and an increase in humanitarian aid will be allowed into the Gaza Strip. However, this first step does not address more contentious long-term issues, such as the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of the territory, which remain significant obstacles to a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>With the announcement of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize imminent, this article explores the secretive deliberation process of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. The committee faces unusual public pressure this year due to a vocal campaign by Donald Trump and his supporters for him to win the award, particularly in light of the recent Gaza peace deal. However, experts point out that the nomination period closed in January, long before the deal was announced, suggesting he could be a more viable contender next year if the peace holds.</p>

          <p>Construction activity at the Port of Long Beach was halted on Wednesday after workers discovered an unexploded explosive device dating back to World War II. The finding prompted an immediate evacuation of the container terminal where the shell was found, and a safety perimeter was established by local authorities and the U.S. Coast Guard. A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team was dispatched, successfully determined the device was safe to move, and transported it off-site for deactivation, allowing port operations to resume.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that Donald Trump's direct, personal involvement was the decisive factor in brokering the initial peace agreement between Israel and Hamas. The author argues that by leveraging his political influence over Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and using regional allies to pressure Hamas, Trump forced a breakthrough where previous efforts had failed. The success of this high-pressure diplomatic strategy, if it holds, could signal a new approach for Trump's engagement in the broader, long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
