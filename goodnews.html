        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a three-day strike, NJ Transit engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) reached an agreement, ending the first rail strike in New Jersey in decades. The deal, described as fair and fiscally responsible by Governor Phil Murphy, includes work rule concessions that will offset wage increases. While the strike is over, train service will not resume until Tuesday, as NJ Transit requires 24 hours to conduct safety checks and reposition equipment. Commuters are encouraged to work from home on Monday to facilitate the return to normal operations, with full service expected to resume on Tuesday morning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annual energy bills in the UK are predicted to fall by ¬£129 in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight forecast that a typical household's dual-fuel bill will decrease by nearly 7% to ¬£1,720 per year. While this reduction offers some relief to households, energy prices remain significantly higher than pre-decade levels, raising concerns about affordability for many. The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales, and Scotland and is updated every three months.</p>

Uncapped full-back Joe Carpenter's consistent performance for Sale has been integral to the team's late-season form. Winger Adam Radwan, who has scored nine tries in nine games since joining Leicester, is also difficult to ignore. Exeter back row Ethan Roots delivered a timely performance, while Will Evans continues to lead the league's turnover charts.</p>
