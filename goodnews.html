          <p>Despite their recent public feud, it may be difficult for President Trump to cut ties with Elon Musk due to the U.S.'s reliance on SpaceX for space-related activities. SpaceX dominates the space launch market and is crucial for military, intelligence, and NASA programs. Canceling Musk's contracts could significantly hinder projects like the Golden Dome missile defense system and NASA's Artemis program. This situation highlights the complex relationship between the government and private companies in strategic sectors.</p>
