          <h2>Former MLB Executive Criticizes Royals' Decision to Call Up Prospect Early</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Miami Marlins team president David Samson has criticized the Kansas City Royals' decision to call up their top prospect, Jac Caglianone, to the major leagues, calling it an "irresponsible" move due to service time implications. Samson argues that the Royals should have waited to call up Caglianone to delay his arbitration eligibility by a full year, potentially saving the team millions of dollars. He believes the decision puts added pressure on Caglianone to perform immediately and suggests the team is disregarding payroll considerations. Caglianone had a strong performance in the minor leagues, but went 0-for-5 in his MLB debut.</p>
