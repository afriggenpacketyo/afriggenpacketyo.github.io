She joins Dame Emily Thornberry and Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race to succeed Angela Rayner. Candidates face a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 Labour MPs. The contest highlights different ideological wings of the party, with Phillipson representing a more centrist, government-aligned position while others signal a desire to be a more critical voice for the party's membership.</p>

          <p>A 500-pound bomb from World War II was discovered during construction in Bratislava, Slovakia's capital, leading to widespread evacuations. The emergency measures affected several downtown blocks and halted traffic, including on a major bridge over the Danube River. This area, which housed an oil refinery targeted by Allied bombing in 1944, has a history of such discoveries, with unexploded ordnance from the war being a recurring issue across Europe. Experts were called in to defuse the device and restore normalcy to the city.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 07:04:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage approaching a one-year low, prospective homebuyers still have methods to secure even better loan terms. Financial experts advise that improving one's credit score is the most critical step, as higher FICO scores qualify for lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable terms and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>Unitree Robotics, a leading Chinese developer of humanoid robots, is planning an initial public offering that could value the company at as much as $7 billion. This move comes as the global race to commercialize AI-powered humanoid robots intensifies, with applications in industrial and service sectors. The IPO would make Unitree one of the first specialized companies in this field to go public, supported by Beijing's strategic push for scaled production of such technology by 2025. The company has already deployed robots in factories for EV makers like BYD and Geely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid rising trade friction with the United States under the Trump administration, India is actively rebalancing its foreign policy by strengthening ties with China and Russia. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent high-profile appearance with Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin symbolizes this strategic shift. However, foreign policy experts assert that New Delhi is not abandoning Washington but pursuing a policy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy. This diplomatic maneuvering aims to leverage relationships across different power blocs to protect India's interests in an increasingly volatile global environment.</p>

          <p>Applications to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are surging as the political climate under the Trump administration becomes more contentious, according to former Spelman College president Beverly Daniel Tatum. She suggests that as society expresses more anti-Black sentiment, Black students are increasingly seeking affirming communities like HBCUs "where their history isn’t being erased." While this trend is a positive sign for the institutions, it also presents a challenge, as many applicants require financial aid that under-resourced HBCUs struggle to provide.</p>

          <p>In his book "Raising A Nation," researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should shift their focus from purely economic arguments to a moral one. He contends that framing child care primarily as a tool to help parents work is less effective than positioning it as a fundamental right, similar to public education. Haspel suggests that a more compelling case can be built around child care's benefits to family well-being, community strength, and even national security, which could broaden its appeal across the political spectrum.</p>

Brown spent eight years researching cutting-edge brain science for the book, which explores the potential for this knowledge to be weaponized.
