          <p>Republican senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a bill to establish regulatory guidelines for digital assets. The proposed legislation aims to define crypto as either a commodity or a security, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) oversight. The bill also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Supporters hope to build on bipartisan momentum after a recent stablecoin bill passed the Senate, with the Senate Banking Committee's digital assets subcommittee holding a hearing on the bill.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions players have rallied around their foreign-born team-mates, after Australia coach Joe Schmidt highlighted the ancestry of some of the tourists' squad. Schmidt referred to New-Zealand-born Bundee Aki and Australian-born Sione Tuipulotu as a "southern hemisphere centre pairing" as the Ireland and Scotland stars teamed up against Argentina in Dublin. Russell said he has no issues with the players being born in New Zealand or Australia. The players deserve their spot in the team.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed confidence that the Senate will pass President Donald Trump's spending bill, committing to remain in Washington, D.C., until the bill is approved. Thune acknowledged pushback from some Republican lawmakers concerned about the bill's impact on the national debt. The White House has also reiterated the importance of passing the bill by the July 4 deadline. The bill is designed to extend tax cuts, create new ones, fund immigration enforcement, and modify the social safety net.</p>
