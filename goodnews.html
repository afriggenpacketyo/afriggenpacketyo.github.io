          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has announced his ambition to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat rarely achieved by wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old, who is sumo's 75th yokozuna, is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the top rank since his own stablemaster in 2017. Onosato also expressed his desire to energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year, through his performance in the ring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to growing security threats in Europe, particularly Russian aggression, Denmark's parliament has passed a law extending military conscription to women for the first time. The new gender-neutral draft will be implemented in 2025, with the duration of service also increasing from four to 11 months for all conscripts. This reform is a key component of Denmark's broader military buildup, which includes a significant increase in defense spending to bolster its national and NATO-allied combat power.</p>
