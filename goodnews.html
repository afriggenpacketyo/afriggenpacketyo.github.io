          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other board members have settled a shareholder lawsuit related to the 2018 Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal. The class-action suit, which sought $8 billion, alleged that the company's leadership failed to disclose the risks of user data being misused, thereby violating a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission. The settlement was reached just one day after the trial began, preempting the scheduled testimony of Meta board member Marc Andreessen. Meta declined to comment on the specifics of the settlement, noting the lawsuit was against the directors personally, not the company itself.</p>

          <p>NBCUniversal has agreed to a $3.6 million settlement with Los Angeles County to resolve a lawsuit alleging its Peacock streaming service violated consumer protection laws. The legal action stemmed from complaints that the service made it difficult for subscribers to cancel and did not clearly disclose its automatic renewal policies. As part of the settlement, Peacock must make its renewal and cancellation terms more transparent and provide an easy, immediate cancellation method. The payment includes $2 million in civil penalties and $1.5 million to fund the county's consumer protection enforcement efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the feasibility of debt consolidation for individuals whose primary income is from Social Security. While it is possible to consolidate debt, qualifying for traditional loans can be challenging due to fixed incomes and potentially high debt-to-income ratios. The article outlines several alternatives, including home equity loans for homeowners with good credit, debt management plans through credit counseling agencies, and direct negotiation with creditors for hardship programs. For those with unmanageable debt, debt settlement or, as a last resort, bankruptcy are also presented as potential pathways to financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville is recalling over 67,000 cases of its Power Stick roll-on deodorants across the United States due to manufacturing defects. The recall, posted by the Food and Drug Administration, affects three specific products: Power Stick for Her Powder Fresh, Power Stick Invisible Protection Spring Fresh, and Power Stick Original. The notice indicates the recall is due to deviations from "current good manufacturing practices," a set of guidelines for pharmaceutical production, though the exact nature of the issue was not specified. Consumers are advised to check the UPC codes and lot numbers of their products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on bags. This follows a recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. Noem stated she is questioning all TSA procedures and that the size limits for liquids could be the next rule to be revised, though she did not provide a specific timeline. The current rule, implemented after a 2006 foiled terror plot, limits liquids to 3.4-ounce containers, a regulation that could be updated with new technology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that children under the age of seven should not consume shop-bought slushy drinks. The guidance is based on health concerns related to glycerol, a sweetening agent used in the drinks to create their slushy texture. Ingesting large amounts of glycerol can lead to side effects in young children, including headaches, sickness, and in severe cases, shock or loss of consciousness. The FSA also recommends that children aged seven to ten limit their consumption to no more than one 350ml slushy per day and has called for warning labels at points of sale.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Democratic legislators, has introduced the Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2025. The bill aims to make excessive price hikes by large corporations illegal, granting new enforcement powers to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. Warren argues that companies use events like President Trump's tariff policies as cover to unnecessarily raise prices on consumers. The proposed legislation would require companies with over $100 million in revenue to publicly report and justify significant price increases, and it would allocate an additional $1 billion to the FTC for enforcement.</p>

Opening on July 17, 1955, the park introduced immersive, story-driven attractions that set a new standard for family entertainment. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, Disneyland grew into the world's second-most visited theme park, attracting over 17 million people in 2023. The summer-long celebration includes new shows, parades, and the debut of a lifelike animatronic of founder Walt Disney.

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning medication, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount from its list price. This move allows the pharmaceutical companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the middlemen who typically negotiate drug prices. Analysts suggest this direct-to-consumer model may not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated to PBMs. The strategy is also seen as a way to build goodwill with the Trump administration amid ongoing scrutiny of drug pricing.

The evaluation ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis, and tests showed normal cardiac function. The White House also addressed bruising on the president's hand, attributing it to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use for cardiovascular prevention, and affirmed he remains in excellent overall health.</p>

The 39-year-old Svyrydenko is considered a Zelenskyy confidante and a dynamic politician with experience in wartime negotiations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the voting age to 16 has sparked debate over which political parties might benefit. While polls show younger voters currently favor left-leaning parties like Labour and the Greens, the overall impact on a general election is considered uncertain. Pollsters note there is limited data on the 16-17 age group, and voting patterns could shift by the next election. With this demographic making up less than 3% of the eligible population and having historically lower turnout, their influence on a national result is likely to be negligible, though it could be decisive in marginal constituencies.</p>
