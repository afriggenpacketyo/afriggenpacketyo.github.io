          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has incorporated over 6,000 new words this year, reflecting the dynamic influence of internet culture and modern work trends on the English language. Among these additions are viral slang terms like "Skibidi," a versatile gibberish phrase, and "tradwife," referring to a married mother embracing traditional roles while active on social media. Other notable inclusions are "delulu," a play on "delusional," and "mouse jiggler," a device used to simulate activity during remote work. The dictionary also added "broligarchy," a term combining "bro" and "oligarchy" to describe powerful tech leaders. This significant expansion underscores the dictionary's effort to capture contemporary linguistic shifts that are expected to have lasting relevance in common usage.</p>

This marks Wegovy as the first GLP-1 class treatment authorized for MASH, a progressive liver condition affecting about 5% of U.S. adults. The approval expands the drug's applications beyond diabetes and obesity, reinforcing its presence in the metabolic disease market and demonstrating significant improvement in liver fibrosis during trials.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League season has commenced, revealing new tactical approaches and team dynamics. Liverpool, under Arne Slot, displayed strong attacking play but appeared vulnerable to counter-attacks, conceding two fast-break goals in their first game, matching their total from the entire previous season. This vulnerability is linked to sloppy midfield passing and committing too many players forward. Meanwhile, Manchester City has found solutions to compensate for Rodri's absence, demonstrating strong expected goal differences. Arsenal, under Mikel Arteta, is experimenting with a more direct, counter-attacking style, which proved ineffective in their opening match but holds potential for future success if execution improves.</p>

          <p>MSNBC is slated for a significant rebranding later this year, changing its name to MS NOW (My Source, News, Opinion, World) as its parent company, Comcast, spins it off into a new corporate entity called Versant. This strategic move aims to establish a distinct and independent news organization, separating it from NBC News and removing the iconic NBC peacock logo. The network is aggressively expanding its operations, including hiring approximately 100 new journalists and establishing its first dedicated Washington D.C. bureau. While key on-air personalities will remain, and the channel will maintain its progressive political commentary, this change signifies a major step in charting its own course in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) industry is now spearheading the nation's "going global" strategy, demonstrating a significant surge in overseas investment. For the first time last year, Chinese EV companies allocated more capital abroad than domestically, marking a historic departure from their previous focus on the internal market. This strategic pivot is intended to circumvent intense domestic competition and establish an offshore economic footprint. Despite the inherent higher costs, delays, and risks associated with international expansion, this move reflects China's ambition to leverage its EV sector as a crucial driver for global economic influence, particularly in light of existing domestic factory overcapacity.

          <h2>Novo Nordisk Slashes Ozempic Price for Cash-Paying U.S. Patients</h2>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has announced a significant price reduction for its blockbuster diabetes drug, Ozempic, now offering it to cash-paying U.S. patients for less than half its monthly list price. This decision comes amid mounting political and public pressure on drugmakers to lower medication costs in the country. Patients can now access Ozempic for $499 per month through various channels, including the drug's official website, Novo Nordisk's patient assistance program, and its recently launched direct-to-consumer online pharmacy, which also provides home delivery. This initiative aims to broaden access for eligible Type 2 diabetes patients lacking insurance coverage and to deter the use of potentially unsafe compounded alternatives. Eli Lilly has also made similar moves with its popular diabetes and obesity drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Disability Memoirs Challenge Traditional Narratives of Overcoming Adversity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new wave of disability memoirs is transforming the genre, moving beyond traditional "inspirational" or "activist" narratives to offer more nuanced and ambivalent portrayals of living with impairment. Authors like Andrew Leland, Chloé Cooper Jones, and Raymond Antrobus explore the complexities, contradictions, and personal struggles of disability, focusing on coexistence rather than "overcoming." These works delve into deeply philosophical questions, societal assumptions, and personal shame, challenging the inadequacy of binary categories in defining identity. This evolving genre emphasizes disability as a rich lived experience worthy of serious literary analysis, aiming to foster a more profound understanding of the human condition rather than simply eliciting pity or providing easy lessons for readers.</p>

          <p>Google and Kairos Power have announced a partnership to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Kairos' Hermes 2 reactor, connected to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) electric grid by 2030. This initiative marks the first U.S. utility power purchase agreement with an advanced reactor, with TVA committing to buy up to 50 megawatts of power. The collaboration aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced nuclear technology by ensuring that consumers are not burdened with the initial construction costs, with Google and Kairos bearing the financial risk. The plant, which will power Google's data centers, is intended to establish a standardized, cost-efficient reactor design, potentially ushering in a new era of carbon-free nuclear energy construction in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla has announced that its Model Y L, a new six-seat version of its popular Model Y featuring a longer wheelbase, is "coming soon" to the Chinese market. This strategic product refresh comes as Tesla navigates intensifying competition within China's electric vehicle sector, including the recent launch of Xiaomi's YU7. The announcement follows a reported 8.4% decline in Tesla's July sales of China-made EVs, underscoring the pressures of an ongoing price war that has impacted automakers, suppliers, and dealerships. In addition to the Model Y L, a longer-range, rear-wheel drive Model 3 is also anticipated for the Chinese market, as indicated by recent regulatory filings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 08:21:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian markets surged following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's announcement of significant tax cuts, including a streamlined two-rate Goods and Services Tax (GST) structure, designed to invigorate the domestic economy. These reforms, unveiled in his Independence Day speech, aim to simplify tax compliance, reduce rates, and modernize the GST framework to attract investment and stimulate consumption. This strategic economic boost is particularly timely as India confronts additional U.S. tariffs imposed by the Trump administration over its ongoing purchases of Russian crude oil. Analysts suggest these robust domestic measures could largely counterbalance the adverse effects of the U.S. tariffs, thereby supporting India's predominantly consumption-driven economic growth.
