          <p>Friedrich Merz failed to be elected German chancellor in the first parliamentary vote, falling short of the required majority. Merz needed 316 votes but only received 310, marking a setback as he was widely expected to secure the position. The parliamentary session was halted after the result, and a second vote must occur within 14 days, according to the German constitution. Merz's Social Democratic Union, along with its sister party, was due to form a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party after winning the largest share of votes in the February election.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer posted a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its full-year guidance. The company reported a 2% revenue decrease on a currency-adjusted basis, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily driven by soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, due to uncertain consumer outlook. The group confirmed its 2025 outlook, forecasting full-year sales to be in line with last year's figures, while closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and trade tensions.</p>
