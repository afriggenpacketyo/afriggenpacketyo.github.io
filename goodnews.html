          <p>Perfect Game, a youth baseball organization, is partnering with PitchCom to introduce MLB technology to amateur events. PitchCom, developed after the Houston Astros scandal, allows catchers to call pitches via a transmitter, sending audio clips to receivers worn by pitchers and fielders. This partnership aims to enhance communication, prevent sign stealing, and improve the pace of play in youth baseball. The technology also offers psychological benefits, allowing coaches to send encouraging messages to players discreetly, while also being able to better develop the kids.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures are surging following a federal court's decision to freeze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in assessing the tariffs. The court's decision has led to increased optimism in overseas markets, with indices in Germany, France, and Asia experiencing gains. Analysts anticipate that the ruling will reduce downside risks to the economy and upside risks to inflation if the Trump administration loses its appeal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is arranging a charter flight to return a Guatemalan man to the United States after a federal judge ruled his deportation violated due process. The judge found that necessary due process steps were "ignored" by the Trump administration during the man's removal proceedings. The man, identified as O.C.G., had sought asylum in the U.S. after facing violence in Guatemala, but was deported to Mexico despite an immigration judge's ruling that he should not be removed to any country other than Guatemala without additional due process.</p>

The partnership, called Blue Sky, will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and offer reciprocal loyalty benefits.

          <p>This article discusses the decline of community involvement in child discipline in the United States and advocates for a return to more collective oversight. The author shares an experience in Prague where a stranger corrected her child's behavior, highlighting the contrast with American norms. The article explores historical and cultural perspectives on child-rearing, suggesting that a more communal approach can be beneficial. It argues that parental responsibility is increased when there is community involvement, and that children are more likely to respect societal norms when a stranger is able to provide gentle correction.</p>
