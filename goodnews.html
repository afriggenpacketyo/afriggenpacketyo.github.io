          <p>China's foreign ministry has indicated it will consider lifting its ban on Japanese seafood imports, responding to Japan's request after discussions on technical conditions for resuming shipments. This development signals a potential thaw in relations between the two countries amidst uncertainties in US trade policies. China's customs officials confirmed progress in bilateral talks regarding the safety of Japanese seafood. Japan has pledged to implement credible measures to ensure its seafood meets China's regulatory standards, marking a move towards resolving trade tensions and restoring seafood exports.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge indicated subdued inflation in April, alongside a slowdown in consumer spending. This development has led the Federal Reserve to maintain its hold on interest rate cuts, awaiting further clarity on economic policies.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major automakers are reintroducing extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), a type of plug-in hybrid, to address changing consumer demands and bridge the gap between traditional hybrids and full EVs. EREVs utilize battery-powered motors for propulsion, complemented by a small gas engine acting as a generator to charge the batteries. Several automakers, including Ram, Jeep, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Nissan, plan to launch EREV models with extended ranges, some exceeding 560 miles. Factors driving this resurgence include lower production costs due to smaller batteries, reduced complexity compared to plug-in hybrids, and the alleviation of range anxiety for consumers. </p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are currently high, but prospective homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance can still secure favorable rates by improving their credit profiles and comparing lenders. As of May 30, 2025, the average 15-year mortgage rate is 6.14%, and the 30-year mortgage rate is 6.95%, according to Bankrate's national averages. Experts suggest that if the Federal Reserve halts rate hikes, mortgage rates may stabilize, offering relief to borrowers.

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in emergency savings can significantly improve financial well-being. Survey respondents with this level of savings reported a 21% higher level of financial well-being compared to those without emergency savings. The study, which surveyed over 12,400 investors, also found that individuals with emergency savings spend less time worrying about finances and are less distracted at work.

          <p>Harvard University has terminated a tenured professor, Francesca Gino, for falsifying data in multiple published papers, marking the first such firing in at least 80 years. The decision followed accusations of data manipulation documented on the Data Colada blog, with Gino's main academic area being honesty in business. While Harvard faces challenges from the Trump administration, the university's handling of the Gino case is considered a positive step in addressing scientific fraud. The incident underscores the need for stricter standards and serious consequences for scientific misconduct in academia.</p>
