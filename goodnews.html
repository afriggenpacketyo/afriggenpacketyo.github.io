          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, with ownership transferring to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation before the end of his term. The article details that the unusual arrangement has raised legal questions about potential violations of bribery laws and the Constitution's emoluments clause. Lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice have analyzed the proposal, concluding that it is legally permissible because the gift is not conditioned on any official act and is given to the Air Force, then the library foundation. The Air Force would modify the aircraft to meet military specifications before transferring it to the foundation.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed reservations about cutting the consumption tax to combat inflation, citing concerns about the impact on state coffers. Senior officials in his administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are reportedly hesitant to reduce the tax, which is currently 8% for food and beverages and 10% for other items. The coalition government is working on an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. Meanwhile, the article also notes that app-based digital salary payments are struggling to gain traction in Japan, despite the country's move toward a cashless society.</p>

          <p>A plan to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront area has sparked controversy, with some residents suggesting racial motives. The article outlines that the basketball courts, built shortly after segregation ended on the city's beaches, are popular among a diverse group of players. Critics fear that the conversion to pickleball will destroy a long-standing community tradition and exclude minority residents who frequent the courts. While developers claim pickleball was chosen for its broader appeal, opponents argue that the decision reflects an effort to 'whiten' the beach.</p>
