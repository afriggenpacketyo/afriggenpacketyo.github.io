          <p>Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in Intel, leading to a significant 32% surge in Intel's stock price. This collaboration aims to co-develop data center and PC chips, integrating Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing with Intel's CPUs. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang highlighted this as a "historic collaboration" to expand ecosystems and establish foundations for the next computing era. This investment follows previous support for Intel from SoftBank and the U.S. government, marking a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing and Intel's turnaround efforts.

          <p>The United Kingdom has carried out its first deportation of a small boat migrant to France under a new "one in one out" pilot scheme. An Indian national was removed on Thursday morning, marking an initial step in the year-long agreement designed to deter illegal English Channel crossings. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated this action sends a clear message that illegal entry will lead to removal, despite ongoing legal challenges and concerns raised by the anti-slavery commissioner about the system's potential for abuse. The scheme also anticipates the first arrivals from France to the UK under a new asylum route soon.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett indicated the White House's approval of the Federal Reserve's recent decision to cut its key borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point. Despite some administration officials, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, advocating for a larger half-point reduction, Hassett described the 25-basis-point cut as "prudent policy" and a "good first step." President Trump, who has previously criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more aggressively, has yet to comment.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, the first of 2025, has significantly eased mortgage costs, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.13%. This reduction means a $500,000 mortgage now costs approximately $3,039.67 per month in principal and interest, a saving of about $300 compared to earlier in the year. Over the loan's lifetime, this could amount to over $100,000 in interest savings. The rate cut provides new opportunities for both first-time buyers and existing homeowners considering refinancing, making homeownership more accessible and affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Researchers Discover the Brain's Internal Mechanism for Distance Estimation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 11:10:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a "mileage clock" within the brain, observing how specific cells in rats' brains "fired" in a pattern correlating with distance traveled. This discovery, made by recording brain activity in running rats, indicates how our internal map estimates distance. Further experiments with human volunteers suggest a similar mechanism exists in the human brain. Disrupting this internal clock, such as by altering the environment, causes both rats and humans to misjudge distances, akin to navigating in fog. This research offers crucial insights into how the brain navigates and what happens when this internal system malfunctions.</p>

          <p>Workers have completed the breakthrough of the Brenner Base Tunnel, an underground connection under the Alps that will become the world's longest high-speed rail line. This infrastructure project, linking Italy and Austria, is central to a European Union initiative to shift freight from roads to rail, aiming to reduce pollution and boost cross-border trade. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed it as a "historic day" for Europe. The 55 km tunnel, due to open in 2032 after significant delays and cost overruns, will drastically cut travel times between Fortezza and Innsbruck, addressing the heavy road traffic through the Brenner Pass.</p>

The move follows reports of a spike in donor revocations and instances where organs were nearly removed from patients mistakenly declared dead.
