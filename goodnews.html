          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is gradually restarting some production this week, beginning with its Wolverhampton engine factory, after a major cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its global operations in August. The incident, which paralyzed manufacturing and parts distribution, is estimated to have cost the company at least £50 million weekly. The resumption offers relief to JLR's supply chain, including small businesses that faced immense financial pressure, prompting a £1.5 billion government loan guarantee. However, full operational capacity is weeks away, and experts warn of lasting impacts on the supply chain due to the extensive disruption.</p>

          <p>Veteran journalist Lesley Stahl shared her experience interviewing the "band" Spinal Tap on the set of their sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues." Expecting to speak with the actors, Stahl found herself immersed in an improvised encounter with Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer, who remained in character. Director Rob Reiner explained the film's unique mockumentary style, where dialogue is entirely improvised from an outline, making the editing process akin to a jigsaw puzzle without a picture. This approach, pioneered by the original "This is Spinal Tap," has influenced modern comedy, showcasing the actors' natural comedic gifts.</p>

          <p>Rob Reiner, the acclaimed actor and director, discussed his extensive film career, which began with the improvised cult classic "This is Spinal Tap" in 1984 and continues with its sequel. Reiner, who also played Marty DiBergi in the film, highlighted the challenge of securing funding for a scriptless movie but praised the improvisational genius of its stars. He shared personal anecdotes, including his early acting career on "All in the Family" and the autobiographical elements in "Stand By Me." Reiner's return to "Spinal Tap" after regaining the rights, now featuring cameos from music legends, underscores his enduring impact on cinema.</p>

          <p>Families experiencing rare and severe vaccine injuries are turning to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, often referred to as "vaccine court," for financial redress. Established in the 1980s to ensure vaccine availability while compensating the injured, the program has awarded nearly $5 billion since its inception. Cases like Jacob Thompson's, who developed severe epilepsy after a DTaP shot, highlight the program's role in assisting those harmed by a public health good. Despite its intent for quick resolution, the court faces criticism for significant delays, with a backlog of over 3,000 cases, prompting calls for congressional action.</p>

          <p>China is aggressively investing in AI and robotics, aiming to reduce its reliance on imported high-end chips and challenge US technological dominance. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledges China is "nanoseconds behind" in chip development, as Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei unveil powerful new chips and strategies to capture the domestic market. Huawei, in particular, announced a three-year plan to rival Nvidia, making its designs publicly available. While experts note China's advancements in predictive AI, they caution about a lingering gap in complex analytics and the need for more developed supply chains, despite the country's vast talent pool.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed $100,000 H-1B visa fee hike is prompting India to actively encourage its skilled diaspora to return home, aiming to reverse a decades-long "brain drain." While anecdotal evidence suggests a growing interest among Indians in the US to relocate, particularly those facing green card uncertainties, large-scale reverse migration faces challenges. Startups like B2I are emerging to help navigate this transition, and a boom in Global Capability Centres in India offers new job opportunities. However, experts argue that a more concerted government effort, beyond just a hostile US immigration environment, is needed to truly incentivize a mass return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced significant housing market reforms aimed at cutting costs, reducing delays, and halving failed property sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated these changes would "fix the broken system," potentially saving first-time buyers an average of £710 and shortening transaction times by four weeks. Key proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide upfront information on property condition, leasehold costs, and chain details. The introduction of binding contracts is also being considered to reduce transaction collapses, alongside a new mandatory Code of Practice for industry professionals to boost standards and consumer confidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historian Martin Powers argues that examining Chinese society and government through visual art offers unique insights into historical political ideas. Unlike texts, public images reveal widely understood societal messages and normative views across different eras. Powers provides an example of a Han dynasty prime minister story, depicted across various art forms for centuries, illustrating the concept of national policy versus local jurisdiction. He emphasizes that art actively participates in political debate, shaping perceptions of intergroup relations and authority, such as the aristocratic portrayal of dominant figures over subordinates, reflecting concepts like Montesquieu's "honor" and arbitrary privilege.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests China should shift its economic strategy from being the world's largest exporter to becoming the largest importer within the next 5-10 years. This pivot, to be discussed in the upcoming 15th five-year plan, is crucial for transitioning to a consumption-driven economy and addressing structural imbalances. Such a change would have profound geopolitical and economic implications, moving China towards a "modern socialist country" and reducing its reliance on exports. This new course aims to foster high-quality development and enhance global economic integration.</p>
