          <p>Former Australian Rules Football (AFL) player Mitch Brown has made history by coming out as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown, who played for the West Coast Eagles, stated that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his retirement. He hopes his revelation will foster a safer and more inclusive environment within the AFL, criticizing the league's "hyper-masculinity" and recalling homophobic comments from his playing days. Experts believe this announcement could drive significant cultural and behavioral change in Australian men's sports, encouraging other closeted players.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its Starship rocket, marking a significant comeback after earlier fiery failures. This 10th test flight achieved several key developmental milestones, including the first successful deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites and a stress test of its reusable heat shield. The Super Heavy booster made a controlled splashdown, followed by the spacecraft in the Indian Ocean.

          <p>Moldova, a small country bordering Ukraine, holds increasing geopolitical importance for Russia and Europe, especially since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The article details Moldova's history, including its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and the ongoing Transnistria conflict involving Russian troops. It explains the country's ethnic and linguistic makeup, and how Russia has historically exerted influence, now through hybrid warfare. European leaders' presence at Moldova's Independence Day signifies solidarity, with the EU granting it candidate status and providing military support, but reunification with Romania remains unlikely in the short term.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is exhibiting signs of a cautious recovery, as major developers China Resources Land and Sunac reported improved interim financial results. State-owned CR Land saw its net profit rise 16.2%, driven by property development and robust retail consumption in its malls. Privately owned Sunac narrowed its losses by 14.4% due to reduced operating and financing costs. These results indicate that government stimulus measures and recovering retail sales are beginning to stabilize the industry, which previously faced significant debt crises and tepid sales.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a rare 10th-century walrus tusk figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. The 1.2-inch piece, found in 1796 and forgotten, depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, challenging the common perception of Vikings as savage. Curator Peter Pentz suggests the figure, possibly a king like Harald Bluetooth, signifies wealth and status. Its detailed carvings and "devilish" or "smiling" expression are unique compared to other simple Viking depictions, offering new insights into Viking Age art and self-representation.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system, a crucial step towards making its next-generation nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. The China Institute of Atomic Energy confirmed this breakthrough for integral fast reactors, which are designed for radioactive waste recycling and a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors use high-energy neutrons, making them more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding new fissile material. This development signifies a major advancement in China's pursuit of fourth-generation nuclear technology, enhancing safety and sustainability in nuclear energy production.</p>

Profits for major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months, with mining sector declines offset by improvements in manufacturing and utilities. State-backed firms saw profits drop, while foreign-invested and private enterprises increased. While positive, factory-gate deflation persists, and analysts believe deeper reforms or industry consolidation are needed for sustained recovery, despite government efforts to stimulate demand.
