          <p>Bernard Kerik, who served as New York City's Police Commissioner during the 9/11 attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik rose rapidly through the ranks to become the city's chief law enforcement officer under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. His career later faced significant challenges and controversies, overshadowing his earlier achievements in law enforcement and public service, yet his leadership during the 9/11 crisis remains a significant part of his legacy. His tenure as commissioner was marked by both notable successes and subsequent scandals. </p>

          <p>Coastal rail service connecting Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks vulnerable to landslides and coastal erosion. Crews placed 5,900 tons of boulders and will add 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line. The Orange County Transportation Authority estimates the project's total cost at $300 million. The rail line, serving Metrolink and Amtrak's Pacific Surfliner, has faced recurring interruptions due to eroding bluffs.</p>
