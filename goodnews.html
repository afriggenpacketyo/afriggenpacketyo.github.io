          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, after a retrial that captured national attention. Read was also acquitted of vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene but was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, resulting in a one-year probation order. The trial, which spawned significant media coverage including a Hulu show and a Netflix documentary, saw Read's defense argue she was framed for O'Keefe's death. Supporters gathered outside the courthouse to celebrate her acquittal, while witnesses expressed dismay, calling the outcome a miscarriage of justice.</p>

          <p>The El Segundo Unified School District lost its appeal and must pay $1 million to a former middle school student who sued for failing to protect her from bullying. The appeals court upheld the jury's verdict, finding the district negligent in supervising and training its employees, contributing to the harm suffered by the student. The bullying, which included verbal and cyber harassment, began after the student asked a friend if she could date her ex-boyfriend. The court found that school employees did not follow basic bullying procedures and guidelines, leading to the ruling against the district.</p>

Applicants will be asked to set all social media accounts to "public," with failure to do so potentially seen as evasive. U.S. officials will be looking for indications of hostility toward American citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.

Oral arguments in Trump's appeal are scheduled for June 24. This decision means American taxpayers will not be paying for Trump's ongoing appeal in this case.</p>

Initially, he was caught out of position on multiple occasions, leading to Al-Hilal creating opportunities. However, he contributed to Real's goal by cutting out a pass, and his passing accuracy improved throughout the game. By the time he was substituted, he had played more crosses and entered the final third more than any of his teammates. Despite these positives, he also lost possession of the ball more times than anyone else on the team.</p>
