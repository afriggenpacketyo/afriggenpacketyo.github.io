          <p>The article discusses what debt relief companies can and cannot do for consumers struggling with credit card debt. Debt relief companies offer services such as debt settlement and debt consolidation programs. However, they cannot guarantee settlements, stop credit damage during the program, or prevent legal action by creditors. The article advises consumers to research companies thoroughly and understand their options before enrolling in a debt relief program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Rebounds as Tariff Concerns Ease</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation softened, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, surpassing estimates, while the outlook for near-term inflation decreased. This improvement coincided with a less aggressive tone surrounding President Trump's tariffs, with ongoing negotiations showing potential progress. Despite the rebound, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels due to lingering worries about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell is reportedly close to finalizing a return to Saracens after a challenging season with Racing 92 in France. While the deal is not yet signed, there is an expectation that an agreement will be reached to allow Farrell to move this summer. Saracens are seeking cover for the injured Alex Lozowski, and the club views Farrell as a valuable asset both on and off the pitch. Although initial reports suggested a player-coach role, sources indicate it will be a two-year deal as a player only, with a transition into coaching at Saracens appearing inevitable in the future.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced the inclusion of the reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposed changes would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, as well as "downwinders," to be compensated for exposure to toxic waste. The proposal also allows for claims to be used for increased levels of atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers to be eligible for benefits. Hawley called the inclusion a "huge step forward" in securing compensation for those affected by nuclear exposure, highlighting the bipartisan support for the bill.</p>

          <p>Shares of JBS, a Brazilian meat giant, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65 per share, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. The U.S. listing comes after more than 15 years of planning and amidst a history of corruption and bribery allegations, including a $3.2 billion fine paid by its holding company in 2017. Despite opposition from lawmakers, the SEC approved JBS's request to list in April, with shareholders narrowly approving the move the following month. The company operates globally, including significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia. (not investment advice)</p>

The attorneys general argued that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power to regulate elections.</p>
