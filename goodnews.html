          <p>CBS News's annual "Money Issue" provides a comprehensive guide to retirement, addressing a range of critical topics. The program examines the stability of the Social Security system following significant staffing cuts and explores the Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement, which promotes frugality for an early exit from the workforce. Additional segments cover the trend of Americans retiring overseas for a lower cost of living, the history of the 401(k), and modern retirement lifestyles, from "grandfluencers" on social media to themed communities. The collection of stories offers varied perspectives on achieving a fulfilling and financially secure post-career life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A magnitude 3.0 earthquake centered in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the tri-state area, including New York City and western Connecticut. The event, which occurred late Saturday night, is the second minor quake to strike the state in less than two weeks. Officials reported no immediate damage but warned residents about the potential for aftershocks in the coming days. Geologists note that earthquakes of this size are common along the region's Ramapo Fault line and rarely cause significant damage, though a stronger 4.8 magnitude quake in April 2024 did cause some disruption.</p>

          <p>NBA superstar Stephen Curry, one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, revealed he does not know his exact net worth and is not concerned with the figure. Instead, Curry focuses on building a portfolio of investments he is proud of and creating a positive legacy with the resources he has been blessed with. Financial planners interviewed in the article praised this approach, suggesting that focusing on tangible goals and values over a single number like net worth can lead to greater financial well-being. They advise that tracking cash flow and aligning spending with personal goals is a more powerful indicator of financial health.</p>

BMO Capital initiated coverage on database company MongoDB with a buy rating, citing its leadership in a growing market and potential as a generative AI winner. Following strong earnings, TD Cowen raised its price target for ServiceNow, viewing it as the best-positioned software-as-a-service vendor to monetize AI. Baird also increased its price target for data security firm Varonis Systems after a strong quarterly report driven by its transition to a cloud-based model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully developed a new type of high-strength cryogenic steel, named CHSN01, crucial for the construction of nuclear fusion reactors. The material was created to address a major challenge for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project, which requires materials that can withstand both extreme cold and immense magnetic forces. After a decade of research, the new steel was deployed this year in the construction of the world's first fusion nuclear power generation reactor. This breakthrough places China in a leading position in a critical area of materials science for future energy.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old co-founder and CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful stock market debut. Field, a college dropout who received a Thiel Fellowship in 2012, has a stake in Figma now worth approximately $6.6 billion. The company, which provides web-based design tools, nearly sold to Adobe for $20 billion before the deal was scrapped due to regulatory concerns. Field is described by colleagues as humble and has led Figma to become a dominant force in its industry, representing a major success story in a slow IPO market.</p>

          <p>Dan Ardell, who had a brief but memorable stint with the Los Angeles Angels in 1961, looks back on a baseball career he never truly desired.

He went on to have a successful career in real estate and found a new mission to make a positive difference in the lives of others through philanthropy. Ardell's story is one of finding true passion and purpose outside of the spotlight, a journey he came to fully appreciate later in life.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler is receiving praise for his cameo in the new film "Happy Gilmore 2," where his comedic timing and self-effacing humor are seen as a gift to his public image and the sport. While Scheffler's dominance on the course is undisputed, his robotic efficiency can sometimes lack drama for viewers. The article argues that his fun, roll-with-the-punches persona in the movie, which playfully references his real-life arrest earlier this year, helps to humanize him beyond his on-course stoicism. This portrayal could make the often-unbeatable champion more engaging for a wider audience.</p>

          <p>At a time when major global powers like the United States and the UK are cutting their foreign aid budgets, Spain is leading a small group of countries in the opposite direction. Spain has passed a law to more than double its aid budget by 2030, aiming to reinvest in global development, climate resilience, and human rights. This move, along with similar pledges from Ireland, South Korea, and Italy, comes as the world faces a projected $56 billion funding vacuum for critical programs. The shift could signal a new, more collaborative future for foreign aid, potentially less dominated by a few wealthy nations.</p>
