          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of Ireland, Spain, and Norway have officially recognized the state of Palestine. The decision, which has been under consideration in Ireland for decades, was formalized as a response to the ongoing conflict and a push for a two-state solution. Irish leaders expressed hope that other European nations like Malta and Slovenia will soon follow suit, arguing that recognition can no longer wait for a final peace settlement. Israel has strongly condemned the action, withdrawing its ambassador from Dublin in protest.</p>

The company, a leading producer of gas-fired turbines, is seeing record orders from entities needing to power new AI data centers, leading to a significant financial upswing and a doubling of its stock price this year. This surge in demand has resulted in multi-year backlogs for new turbines, as the energy industry races to build out the necessary infrastructure to support the technological revolution.

          <p>Scottish DJ Calvin Harris and his wife, radio host Vick Hope, have announced the birth of their son, Micah, through an Instagram post that has sparked debate among fans. The post included photos from the home birth and an image of the placenta, which was apparently dehydrated and encapsulated into pills. While many celebrities and fans offered congratulations, others were taken aback by the graphic nature of the placenta photo, which was later given an age restriction by the platform. The post has ignited a conversation about the practice of placentophagy and normalizing the realities of childbirth.</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle experienced a 20% surge after former President Donald Trump publicly praised its new marketing campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump's social media post called the ad the "'HOTTEST' out there" and encouraged the actress, whom he noted is a registered Republican. The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced criticism from some who viewed its play on words as promoting eugenics or being overly sexualized. The endorsement and subsequent stock jump highlight the unpredictable influence of political figures on consumer brands and markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay for retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were scheduled to take effect this week. This suspension provides time for both sides to implement a trade agreement reached in late July between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The deal aims to restore stability and predictability for businesses by setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods, though negotiations on key items like car parts are ongoing. The move represents a de-escalation in trans-Atlantic trade tensions, allowing for further finalization of the agreement's terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Eating Minimally Processed Diets Leads to Double the Weight Loss Compared to 'Healthy' Ultraprocessed Foods</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new randomized controlled trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This occurred despite both diets meeting the UK's official nutritional guidelines. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, not just nutrient content, plays a significant role in calorie intake and weight management.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the 60% Rule and Its Impact on Reverse Mortgage Borrowers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:57:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the 60% rule significantly impacts homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This federal guideline limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds within the first year. The rule was designed to prevent seniors from depleting their home equity too quickly, promoting long-term financial stability. However, for those needing a large lump sum immediately for expenses like debt or home renovations, this restriction can present a challenge, delaying access to the full amount of their available funds.

          <p>Veteran actor Josh Brolin is making his debut in the horror genre with the new film "Weapons," in which he plays a father searching for his vanished child. Brolin stated he was drawn to the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to explore themes of masculinity and vulnerability. Known for blockbuster roles in films like "Dune" and the "Avengers" series, he explained that he has stayed away from horror projects while raising his own children. The film, which Brolin says taps into childhood fears, is set to open in theaters this Friday.</p>
