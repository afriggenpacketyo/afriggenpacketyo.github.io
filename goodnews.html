          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving from Chicago O'Hare veered off the runway and onto the grass at Boston's Logan Airport. The Airbus A220 experienced the incident while turning off the runway. Emergency vehicles responded to the scene, but there were no reported injuries among the passengers. Runway 33-L was temporarily closed for assessment, and passengers were bused to the terminal, with the FAA issuing a ground stop for departures, causing delays averaging 30 minutes or more. Optimism can be found in the fact that no one was hurt and that the issue was handled effectively by airport personnel.</p>

          <p>President Trump extended an invitation to Senator Rand Paul and his family to attend the annual congressional picnic at the White House after Paul publicly criticized being disinvited due to his opposition to the GOP-backed budget bill. Paul had expressed his disappointment, calling the move "incredibly petty," especially since he planned to bring his family, including his grandson. Trump addressed the situation on Truth Social, stating Paul and his family were welcome and joking that it might help secure his vote on the policy bill. The incident underscores the ongoing tensions between the senator and the administration regarding fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>Costco is adding a new perk for its Executive Members, allowing them early access to warehouses starting at 9 a.m., an hour before Gold Star members. This change follows a positive customer response to extended hours at Costco's North American gas stations. Executive Members, who make up 73% of Costco's sales, will now have an additional benefit for their $130 annual membership fee. Costco raised the price of both its Executive and Gold Star memberships last year, and this new perk could attract more members to the higher-tier option.</p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree analyzes tipping rates across the U.S., finding that New Hampshire residents tip the most, averaging 16.07% of spending on food away from home.

District of Columbia residents spend the most on dining out, while Illinois saw the biggest increase in dining expenditures from 2000 to 2023. The analysis provides insight into American tipping habits and the role of gratuities in the service industry.</p>

          <p>U.S. multinational corporations like Apple, Microsoft, and Pfizer have established operations in Ireland, drawn by the country's favorable tax policies. These companies have utilized strategies such as the "double Irish" to reduce their effective corporate income tax rates. The Irish government opened its doors to multinationals in response to an economic crisis in the 1980s, offering low taxes and access to the EU market. However, members of the Trump administration have signaled that some of this activity should return to the United States.</p>

          <p>In times of chaos, rather than seeking safety in routine, Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated for experimentation and risk-taking, a concept applicable to personal well-being. Academic research provides examples of happiness experiments, such as gratitude exercises, social interaction, mindfulness, exercise, and exposure to nature. These interventions aim to disrupt negative behavioral patterns and habits. By tracking metrics like mood and life satisfaction, individuals can measure the effects of these experiments and cultivate more positive habits.</p>
