        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made several additions before the trade deadline, acquiring right-handed relievers Brock Stewart and Paul Gervase, along with versatile outfielder Alex Call. Manager Dave Roberts stated that these moves are intended to "raise the floor" for the team, providing more depth and reliability. Stewart, who previously played for the Dodgers, has reinvented himself as a high-leverage reliever, while Call is known for his ability to grind out at-bats. The team hopes these new players will complement their star-studded core, which they believe needs to perform more consistently to achieve their World Series aspirations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 19:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, disclosed at an internal meeting that the median service length for its current employees is 2.9 years, with an average tenure of three years. This data suggests that about half of the company's 120,000-strong workforce has been with the social media giant for over three years. The disclosure was made to counter online speculation about high employee turnover at the company. These figures position ByteDance as a relatively stable employer within China's competitive tech industry, which is known for its demanding work culture and high turnover rates.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Alex Bessent stated that recent negotiations with Chinese officials in Stockholm have advanced talks toward a potential trade deal beneficial to both nations. In a post on the social media platform X, Bessent expressed optimism about the path forward, crediting the strong relationship between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. However, the administration has delivered mixed messages, and there has been no official confirmation of specific agreements, such as the extension of a pause on new tariff increases. A Chinese commerce official had indicated the tariff pause would continue, but the U.S. has not yet echoed that announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. This ruling provides a reprieve for tens of thousands of individuals who have been living and working legally in the U.S., some for decades. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing that the decision to end the protections was "preordained" and potentially motivated by racial animus. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and stated its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are reportedly exploring a potential reunion with veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen, who was traded from the team last year due to salary cap constraints. Allen, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, is scheduled to meet with the team to discuss a possible return. The move would address the Chargers' need for an experienced receiver, especially after the recent retirement of Mike Williams. During his 11 seasons with the franchise, Allen became its longest-tenured player, and his return could provide a reliable and familiar target for quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel of the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has indicated it may find President Trump's order restricting birthright citizenship unconstitutional, expressing deep skepticism during a hearing. The judges sharply questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not grant citizenship to the U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts that have blocked the policy. The case challenges a key part of Trump's immigration agenda, and its ultimate fate will likely be decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration from using an expedited removal process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. This ruling could curtail controversial arrests by ICE agents at courthouses, where migrants attending hearings were being detained for rapid deportation. The judge found the practice illegal, noting the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" only to be targeted. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including many from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who entered through Biden-era programs.</p>

          <h2>Three Strategic Moves for Long-Term CD Savers Amid Paused Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 17:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to lock in currently high returns with long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests three strategic moves for August: first, determine the maximum amount you can deposit for the longest possible term without risking early withdrawal penalties. Second, use the current rate stability to shop around for the best rates, paying special attention to online banks which often offer higher yields. Finally, re-evaluate where other savings are held and consider moving funds from low-interest accounts to take advantage of the better returns offered by CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Gold Price Outlook for August Remains Uncertain Amid Stable Interest Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 16:28:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant run-up over the past year, the price of gold may be headed for a period of stagnation in August. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold removes a key catalyst for price movement, as rate changes often influence investor demand for the precious metal. While a future spike in inflation could push prices higher, the current economic climate suggests a more muted market. Analysts advise that investors should focus on gold's long-term role as a portfolio diversifier rather than trying to profit from short-term price fluctuations in the current uncertain environment.
