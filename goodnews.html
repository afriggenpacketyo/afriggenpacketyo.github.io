          <p>The OPEC International Seminar convened at Vienna's Hofburg palace, bringing together energy ministers and top CEOs to discuss the state of the oil market, investment, and the green energy transition. The event, hosted in the city where OPEC is headquartered, featured high-level discussions led by figures like Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman. However, the conference was met with protests outside the palace, with demonstrators calling for an oil embargo over the conflict in Gaza. The seminar proceeded with notable absences from Russia and Iran, though Iran's oil minister delivered remarks via video, stressing the need for peace to ensure industry stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actor Ewan McGregor's application to replace the roof of his £2 million historic mansion in Scotland has been rejected by Perth and Kinross Council. His architects argued the existing lead roof was "beyond repair" and that replacing it with a modern single-ply membrane was necessary to prevent water damage and deter theft of the valuable lead. However, the council ruled that the proposed materials and methods would not preserve the C-listed building's special architectural character. McGregor, who bought the 18th-century villa near his birthplace in 2023, had previously received approval for other renovations on the property.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Justin Bieber has released a surprise new album, "Swag," his first in four years. The 20-song record features collaborations with rappers like Sexxy Red and Gunna and appears to address recent public speculation about his mental health and marriage. A viral video clip of Bieber confronting paparazzi, in which he says "I'm standing on business," is sampled on the track "Butterflies." The album's title is a callback to his 2012 hit "Boyfriend," while song titles like "Devotion" and "Forgiveness" suggest a continued exploration of his Christian faith, themes that have been present in his recent work.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European nations, with U.S. participation for the first time, has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future stabilization force in Ukraine. The plan, discussed at a conference in Rome, aims to create a multinational force that can be rapidly deployed after a ceasefire to help reconstitute Ukraine's military and secure its territory. A U.S. delegation, including President Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg and bipartisan senators, was present, signaling unified Western support for Kyiv. The force is intended to provide long-term deterrence against future Russian aggression, though no U.S. ground troops are planned.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway saw a 54% year-on-year increase in June, a stark contrast to the company's declining sales across much of Europe. The surge is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets local demand for space, all-wheel drive, and value for money. This success comes despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political rhetoric, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives, has allowed Tesla to maintain a dominant position there while facing slumps in other key markets like Germany.

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed numerous hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This action aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species in the river's upper reaches, which ecologists consider a last refuge. For decades, the dense network of dams has blocked water flow and migratory routes, drastically reducing fish populations and suitable spawning grounds. The project is part of a broader initiative to address the ecological damage caused by extensive dam construction and improve the health of the Yangtze River basin.</p>
