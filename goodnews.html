          <p>Joseph Nye, a prominent Harvard scholar known for his theory of "soft power" and influence on U.S.-Japan relations, has died at the age of 88. Nye's work emphasized nonmilitary strengths, such as cultural influence, in international relations, and he played a key role in shaping the U.S.-Japan alliance. Along with Richard Armitage, Nye led a bipartisan group that developed proposals to strengthen the bilateral relationship, focusing on integrated partnerships and command-and-control architecture. His contributions to understanding contemporary international relations were lauded by colleagues and Japanese officials alike.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, potentially marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs. While specifics are unclear, discussions have included lowering British tariffs on US cars and farm products, and taxes on US technology companies. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted reducing food production standards, prioritizing an agreement with the EU. A team of British trade negotiators arrived in Washington as talks gathered pace, aiming for an agreement before a UK-EU summit on May 19.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is "teaching" an online writing course, raising ethical questions about using digital prosthetics of deceased individuals. While Christie's family approved the project and emphasized the use of her own words, some ethicists argue that it constitutes a deepfake, as Christie herself cannot consent. The course's release coincides with debates about AI ethics and copyright law, prompting discussions about the boundaries between entertainment, education, and posthumous representation.</p>
