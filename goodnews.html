          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood has established a significant four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended second-round play. After an opening-round 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory. At the time of the suspension due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place at nine under. Twenty-one players, including Justin Rose who was also at nine under, were still on the course and will complete their rounds once play resumes.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has opened several "warm-hearted convenience stores" as an innovative approach to tackling growing social isolation among its residents. These centers offer free food, like ramen, and a welcoming café-like space for people of all ages to connect with social workers and each other. The initiative was prompted by a rise in "lonely deaths" and data showing nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person homes. The program aims to provide a low-stigma environment for those feeling isolated, from unemployed young adults to neglected elderly individuals, to find comfort and community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments like private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to "democratize retirement" by providing access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns but also carry greater risks and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While some experts see this as good news for savers, others caution that adoption by employers may be slow due to concerns about complexity, cost, and fiduciary responsibility under ERISA law.

          <p>A new documentary titled "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides an intimate and honest look at the life of the influential musician who died in 1997.

Through archival footage and interviews with close friends and family, the documentary focuses on Buckley's internal struggles with fame and his artistic process.

The deal aims to end nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. A central component of the agreement is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, which will be named after Trump and grant the U.S. exclusive development rights. Both Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised Trump's role as a peacemaker and stated they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell's career at NASA was legendary, including his role as command module pilot for Apollo 8, the first mission to orbit the Moon. He is most famous for his leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 flight, which suffered an in-flight explosion but returned safely to Earth, a "successful failure" that showcased immense courage and ingenuity. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy praised Lovell's character and steadfast courage, which inspired millions and turned a potential tragedy into a historic success.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants." He posted a picture of their boat on social media, announcing he had alerted authorities and was demanding their deportation. It was later revealed the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease (MND) research. After learning of his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while the rowers, who include a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance with President Donald Trump at the White House, where Cook announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. Trump stated that because of this domestic investment, Apple would be exempt from future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating investor concerns about potential impacts on profitability. This successful meeting, combined with strong recent earnings, has significantly boosted investor confidence in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that median home listing prices are falling in some U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant drops since the market peak in 2022, largely due to higher housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to experience rising prices and tight inventory, with cities like Milwaukee and New York seeing notable increases. The data reveals a divided housing market, where supply and demand dynamics are creating very different conditions for buyers and sellers across the country. (not investment advice)</p>
