          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a third offer for Brentford's forward, Bryan Mbeumo, valued at up to £70 million, consisting of a £65 million initial payment plus add-ons. The club is confident in securing the 25-year-old Cameroon international, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season. The deal is a priority for United, who aim to finalize it before their pre-season tour in the United States. This move addresses the team's struggles with goal-scoring, as they recorded their worst domestic campaign goal tally since the 1973-74 season.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo's stock increased by over 6% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's forecasts. Despite a slight decline in overall sales volume, the company expressed confidence in a rebound for its North American market due to strategic changes. These changes include focusing on healthier snacks, relaunching core brands like Lay's and Tostitos, and implementing cost-cutting measures. PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year outlook, expecting organic revenue to grow by a low single-digit percentage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have sent a complex, three-dimensional "mini-brain" model to the Tiangong space station to investigate the effects of microgravity on the human brain. This brain organoid, grown from living tissue including nerve cells and blood vessels, offers a more human-like model than previous experiments. The research aims to provide real-time data on how brain tissues behave in orbit. Scientists hope this innovative approach will advance space medicine, neuroscience, and drug development by offering unique insights into conditions like Alzheimer's and the aging process.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club, led by Jim Cramer, is adding Cisco Systems to its portfolio, citing the company's significant advancements in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Cisco is seen as a key player in providing the networking equipment essential for AI data centers, and it recently surpassed its goal of $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders. The company's ongoing shift to a subscription-based software model is also improving its profit margins and revenue predictability. With an undemanding valuation and a strong dividend yield, the firm sees potential for the stock to re-rate higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported second-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations and issued a positive forecast for the remainder of 2025, signaling a rebound in travel demand. CEO Scott Kirby noted that the world feels "less uncertain" than it did earlier in the year, giving the airline confidence in a strong finish. While second-quarter revenue was slightly below estimates, the company expects to post adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year. The optimistic outlook comes despite operational constraints at its Newark hub, which impacted profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a major bill aimed at creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The vote follows a period of procedural chaos where a group of right-wing Republicans initially blocked the legislation's advance, seeking to merge it with other bills, including a proposed ban on a central bank digital currency. After negotiations involving President Trump and House leadership, a deal was reached to move the bill forward as a standalone measure. If passed, it would be the first significant piece of cryptocurrency legislation approved by Congress, though it still faces criticism from some Democrats.</p>

          <p>The political rise of mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and his proposed "millionaire tax" has sparked fears of an exodus of the wealthy from New York City. However, data on high-end real estate and wealth concentration shows little evidence of a slowdown. While some high-earners have left, the city's powerful economy, particularly in financial services, continues to generate new millionaires, and the luxury property market remains robust. Analysts suggest that while the narrative of wealth flight is popular, New York's unique cultural and economic appeal helps it maintain its status as a global wealth hub. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, Disney's strategy of leveraging its vast portfolio of intellectual property (IP) remains a core driver of its business success. The experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, is a major profit center, fueled by attractions based on characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. The company plans to invest $60 billion in this division over the next decade, with a heavy focus on creating new lands and rides based on popular franchises. While this sometimes means replacing older, non-IP attractions, the approach successfully broadens the parks' appeal and boosts revenue.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis has raised its full-year profit forecast, driven by a dramatic increase in sales for its breast cancer treatment, Kisqali. The company reported a 64% surge in global sales for the drug in the second quarter and expects it to become a new blockbuster. This growth is crucial as Novartis prepares for the U.S. patent expiry of its top-selling heart failure drug, Entresto, next year. The strong performance of Kisqali and other pipeline drugs has given the company the confidence to announce a new share buyback program of up to $10 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men who were wrongly convicted in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt British Transport Police officer, Derek Ridgewell, have had their convictions quashed by the Court of Appeal. Errol Campbell, who died in 2004, and Ronald De Souza were among many victims, mostly young Black men, framed by Ridgewell. The court expressed regret for their suffering, and Campbell's son stated the conviction caused "absolute misery" for his family. This case is part of a larger review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission that has so far overturned 13 convictions linked to the disgraced officer.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's government has announced it will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for all UK-wide elections, a change expected to be in place before the next general election. The move, a key pledge of the ruling Labour Party, will enfranchise an estimated 1.5 million young people. The reform package also includes plans for automatic voter registration and expanding the types of acceptable voter ID to include bank cards. This represents the most significant change to the British electorate since the voting age was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1969.</p>
