          <h2>Lululemon Shares Plunge After Cutting Full-Year Earnings Guidance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 17:38:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lululemon's shares experienced a significant drop of 23% after the company revised its full-year earnings guidance downwards, despite surpassing Wall Street's expectations for its fiscal first-quarter earnings. CEO Calvin McDonald cited a "dynamic macroenvironment" as the reason for the adjustment, pointing to tariffs and concerns about a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Lululemon plans to implement modest, strategic price increases on a small portion of its product assortment, starting in the second half of the current quarter and continuing into the third quarter. The company's report follows similar actions by other retailers who have reduced or withdrawn their guidance due to tariff-related uncertainties. The brand believes it is better positioned than most to navigate the current environment, and is still expecting revenue growth. Optimism surrounding the brand is tempered by the overall economic uncertainty. </p>
