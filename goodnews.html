          <p>During his upcoming three-day state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and lay a wreath. The visit will also include meetings with King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales, culminating in a state banquet at the castle. Additionally, President Trump will hold talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the Chequers country residence.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision lets a lower court's injunction stand while the student's lawsuit against a state policy restricting bathroom access proceeds. The state's rule ties school funding to compliance with a ban on transgender students using facilities that align with their gender identity. In its unsigned order, the court noted the denial was not a ruling on the legal merits of the case, with Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissenting.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed its long-standing ban on providing N95 masks to federal firefighters, acknowledging the health risks posed by wildfire smoke. For decades, the agency had argued that masks could lead to heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations like Canada and Australia. The policy change follows reports highlighting the growing body of evidence linking smoke inhalation to serious health issues for firefighters, including cancer. The agency has stockpiled 80,000 masks to be distributed as standard equipment, a move praised by firefighter safety advocates as an implicit admission of smoke's dangers.</p>

Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's 'Match of the Day' after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by stating it demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for the voiceless. Other notable winners at the ceremony included the 'Gavin and Stacey' finale for best comedy and the Netflix series 'Adolescence' for best new drama. The awards are unique in that all winners are determined by public vote.</p>

          <p>Larry Ellison, the co-founder of software giant Oracle, briefly surpassed Elon Musk to become the world's wealthiest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison's net worth surged to $393 billion after Oracle's stock soared over 40% on the strength of a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. Although a slight dip in the share price later in the day returned Musk to the top spot, the event highlighted Oracle's rapid growth in the competitive AI sector. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, has also been involved in potential acquisitions of TikTok and Paramount.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has offered her review of the 2006 film 'The Devil Wears Prada,' which was famously based on her leadership style. Speaking on the New Yorker Radio Hour, Wintour called the movie a "fair shot," praising its humor, wit, and the performance of Meryl Streep, who played the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. Wintour, who recently stepped down from her role at Vogue after 37 years, recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot. Her comments come as a sequel to the hit film is in production.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic rally, soaring nearly 36% for its best single-day performance since 1992 and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The massive surge was fueled by the company's announcement of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This growth is largely attributed to immense demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is crucial for running the large workloads required by the artificial intelligence boom. Despite missing quarterly revenue and earnings estimates, the exceptional backlog has solidified investor confidence in Oracle's position as a key player in the AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected a rock sample on Mars that contains potential biosignatures, marking a significant step in the search for ancient life on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was taken from an ancient river valley in Jezero Crater and exhibits textures and mineral compositions, including iron, phosphorus, and sulfur, that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life. While scientists cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, they are excited by the finding. The next critical step is the proposed Mars Sample Return mission, which would bring the rock to Earth for detailed analysis with advanced instruments.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition criticizing FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, arguing it prioritizes profit over accessibility for genuine fans. Mamdani contends that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate with demand, will make attending games unaffordable for many and could lead to atmospheres dominated by resellers rather than passionate supporters. The petition calls on FIFA to end dynamic pricing, cap resale prices, and allocate 15% of tickets for local residents, measures aimed at making the tournament more inclusive for the communities hosting it.</p>

          <h2>Planned London Bus Strike Largely Averted After Pay Deal is Reached</h2>

          <p>A weekend bus strike that threatened to disrupt dozens of routes across London has been mostly called off after the Unite union reached a pay agreement with one of the major operators. The majority of workers, employed by London United, accepted an above-inflation pay offer and canceled their planned walkout. However, a smaller number of employees at London Transit are still in negotiations, and if a deal is not reached, some industrial action may still affect a handful of routes in the city. The resolution prevents wider travel chaos for Londoners, who have already faced significant disruption from an ongoing London Underground strike this week.</p>

          <p>Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union have reached a tentative five-year labor agreement, potentially ending a strike that began in early August. The deal, which includes improved wages and a restored signing bonus, will be voted on by the more than 3,000 union members based primarily in St. Louis. These workers are responsible for assembling and maintaining critical defense products like F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. The strike was the first in nearly three decades for this unit, which had previously rejected an offer that included a 20% wage increase.</p>
