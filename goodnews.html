          <p>President Trump hosted a black-tie gala for top investors of his meme coin, $TRUMP, at his Virginia golf club. Crypto investor Nicholas Pinto described the event as opulent but underwhelming, noting that the food was subpar and Trump only briefly addressed the attendees without taking questions. Security was reportedly lax, and many guests seemed more concerned with the coin's fluctuating price than the event itself. Despite the high price tag of $148 million spent collectively by the attendees, the event left some feeling underwhelmed, especially those who didn't make it into the top 25 wallets for a private reception.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it will create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy.

U.S. Steel will maintain its headquarters in Pittsburgh, and investors reacted positively, with shares jumping over 20%. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern about the impact on American jobs, while officials from both Pennsylvania and Nippon Steel applauded the news, citing innovation and growth for the American steel industry.</p>

Some NSC staff are being moved to other positions within the administration, while the NSC's communications team is being dissolved.

          <p>Google's AI chatbot, Gemini, is facing criticism for claims about the origins of Memorial Day, alleging that it is controversial due to "White supremacist origins." The Media Research Center (MRC) Free Speech America project highlighted Gemini's assertion that Memorial Day observances were predominantly "white" during the Jim Crow era, overlooking the contributions of Black service members. Gemini also claimed that the holiday is intertwined with national identity and patriotism, which can be controversial for those with differing perspectives on American history and foreign policy. Fox News Digital received a similar response, with Gemini citing Confederate Memorial Days as racially insensitive.</p>

          <p>Eight individuals have been convicted for their involvement in the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris nearly a decade ago. The four perpetrators received sentences of up to eight years, mostly suspended, due to time already served. Kardashian expressed relief at the verdicts, stating she believes in the power of growth and accountability. The robbery occurred during Paris Fashion Week in 2016, with the gang stealing millions of dollars' worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring.</p>
