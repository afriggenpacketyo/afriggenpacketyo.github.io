          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:19:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, the author introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' emphasizing emotional attunement, resilience, and open communication. This style balances clear boundaries with empathy, encouraging parents to accept their child's emotions without dismissal and view misbehavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents prioritize inner healing, take responsibility for conflicts, and create an environment where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves. The framework involves inner work, empathetic boundary setting, and preventing shame, fostering trust and connection between parent and child.</p>

          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress in battling the Inn fire in Mono County near Yosemite National Park and Mammoth Mountain, increasing containment to 15%. The fire, which began on Thursday, prompted evacuations in Mono City and Lundy Canyon, but improved weather conditions allowed for the reopening of Highway 395 and the downgrading of evacuation orders to advisories. Containment efforts focused on clearing brush and establishing containment lines, with the aid of helicopters, engines, and hundreds of personnel. Officials anticipate mild weather in the coming days, urging visitors to exercise caution in the area due to ongoing firefighting operations.</p>

          <p>Alex Palou secured his place in history by becoming the first Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500, edging out Marcus Ericsson in the final laps. The race was marked by several unusual incidents, including a crash by Scott McLaughlin during warm-up laps and a pit road incident involving Alexander Rossi's car erupting in flames. Kyle Larson's attempt to complete 'the double' was cut short due to a three-car collision, preventing him from reaching the Coca-Cola 600 in time. Palou's victory was a significant milestone, adding to his already impressive career with three IndyCar titles in four years.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Man City midfielder. Several players are expected to leave this summer and new faces will come, especially in positions where City are weaker. The club is in a strong position to spend this summer, having posted a record revenue of ¬£715m in their latest accounts, with an overall pre-tax profit of ¬£73.8m. City will be glad to see the back of a disappointing campaign but don't have to wait long to make amends, returning to action in just 24 days' time at the Club World Cup.</p>
