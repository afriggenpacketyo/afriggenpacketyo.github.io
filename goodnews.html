          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has promised increased spending for Scotland in areas such as defense, computing, and carbon-capture technology. The Spending Review includes ¬£250m for the Royal Navy's nuclear submarine base on the Clyde, ¬£750m to bring the UK's most powerful supercomputer to Edinburgh, and funding for the Acorn Project in St Fergus, a carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiative. The review allocates day-to-day spending for the next three financial years and plans capital spending for four years, including spending in Scotland by Whitehall departments, but it does not cover funds spent by Holyrood. Extra funds have been front-loaded, with most of the additional spending in the first two years, followed by tighter budgets, and while defense and the NHS are prioritized, other areas may face cuts. The article conveys a sense of cautious optimism about Scotland's financial future. </p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that his company's robotaxi service is "tentatively" set to launch in Austin, Texas, on June 22. Musk indicated that he's flying from Los Angeles to Austin for the kickoff, and the first driverless trip from the Tesla factory to a customer's house will take place on his birthday, June 28. He also stated that Tesla is being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift. Musk recently told CNBC's David Faber that Tesla will start with a very small rollout, including about 10 to 20 of its robotaxis, with a new, "unsupervised" version of the company's FSD technology installed. The article is forward-looking and innovative in tone. </p>
