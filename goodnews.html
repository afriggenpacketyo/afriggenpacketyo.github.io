          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have unveiled a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, publicly calling on Hamas to accept its terms for an immediate end to military operations. The comprehensive proposal outlines the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans, the destruction of Hamas's tunnels and weapon production facilities, and a staged Israeli troop withdrawal. It also mandates a temporary technocratic Palestinian committee to govern Gaza, with oversight from a new "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump, and leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state. This initiative, which has garnered support from UK and French leaders, seeks to bring stability and reconstruction to the war-torn region after nearly two years of conflict.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Tuesday, with investors keenly awaiting the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) interest rate decision later in the day. The RBA is widely expected to maintain its cash rate at 3.6% due to persistent high inflation, which continues to restrict its ability to loosen monetary policy. Analysts suggest any shift in the RBA's tone or forward guidance could significantly impact AUD crosses, especially given recent volatility in building approvals. Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw modest gains, reflecting varied regional economic sentiments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Florida-based multi-agency task force, Joint Inter-Agency Task Force – South (JIATF-S), has achieved a record-breaking seizure of one million pounds of cocaine in fiscal year 2025. This massive haul, equivalent to 378 million lethal doses, represents an estimated $11.34 billion denial of revenue to powerful cartels and narco-terrorist organizations. Operating across 42 million square miles, JIATF-S collaborates with partner nations to disrupt illicit drug flows through the crucial transit zone between South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. This unprecedented effort significantly impacts criminal networks and aims to protect homeland security by preventing deadly drugs from reaching communities.</p>

          <p>Dr. Gladys Maestre is leading groundbreaking research into alarmingly high rates of dementia in South Texas, where nearly 20% of people over 65 experience memory loss, with a suspected actual figure closer to 40%. Her study, conducted through the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, explores complex factors including genetics, prevalent health issues like diabetes, environmental pollution, and generational trauma as possible causes. The research includes cutting-edge blood testing for biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals for prevention programs. State lawmakers have approved a substantial $3 billion bill to fund dementia research, highlighting the urgent need for answers and improved quality of life for affected families.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to a $24.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump and other plaintiffs, following his suspension from the platform in 2021. The majority of the settlement, $22 million, is designated to support Trump’s construction of a White House State Ballroom, held in a tax-exempt entity. Trump's lawsuit alleged that YouTube infringed upon his constitutional right to free speech by banning him indefinitely from the platform. This settlement follows similar agreements with Meta and X, marking a pattern of social media companies resolving legal challenges related to his post-January 6th platform suspensions. The notice of settlement states it does not constitute an admission of liability.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Differentiates Current AI Boom from 2000 Dotcom Bubble</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the current artificial intelligence boom is fundamentally different from the dotcom bubble of 2000, citing the financial strength and quality of leading Big Tech companies. He notes that today's hyperscalers, such as Nvidia and Microsoft, possess ample cash reserves and diversified operations, unlike many debt-laden dotcom firms that collapsed. While acknowledging investor skepticism, Cramer suggests this caution helps prevent market overexuberance, ensuring a more stable and sustainable growth trajectory for the AI sector. He remains confident in these companies' ability to adapt and succeed as AI technology advances, but advises continued scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has launched a new action plan to curb cutthroat competition in its strategic non-ferrous metals sector. The plan projects a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary non-ferrous metals this year, down from 4.3% last year, focusing instead on optimizing industrial structure for an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output. It also calls for advancements in exploration of critical metals like copper, aluminum, lithium, and nickel, alongside enhanced recycling efforts for used batteries and solar panels. This move aims to stabilize processing fees and smelter margins, ensuring sustainable development for this vital supplier to China's manufacturing and hi-tech industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a prototype of its "Golden Dome" system, a "distributed early warning detection big data platform" capable of simultaneously monitoring a thousand missiles globally. This advanced missile defense system integrates data from diverse sensors across space, ocean, air, and ground to identify potential threats, analyze trajectories, and differentiate warheads from decoys in real-time. It represents the first known missile defense system with planet-wide coverage, although its fundamental architectural plan is still in early stages of development. The project aims to significantly enhance China's strategic defense capabilities by rapidly processing massive volumes of data through highly secure military networks.</p>
