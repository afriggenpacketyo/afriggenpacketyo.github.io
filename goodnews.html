          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Improves as Trump Rolls Back Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 12:40:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, signaling optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs, ending six months of worsening attitudes. The University of Michigan survey data showed improvements across all demographics, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. Trump's easing of tariffs, including a trade agreement with China, contributed to the surge in the stock market and softened forecasts of an economic downturn. However, warning signs remain about potential price increases, with retailers voicing alarm and the OECD expecting U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of "No Kings Day" protests are planned across the U.S. to protest the Trump administration and counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. Protests are intended to address concerns about immigration enforcement, civil rights, and cuts to the federal government. Organizers emphasize peaceful and nonviolent demonstrations, with events planned in over 2,000 communities, excluding downtown D.C. to avoid potential retaliation, and at least two states are calling up the National Guard as a precaution against potential violence. </p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded in early June, showing less pessimism about the economy and inflation due to potential progress in the global trade war. The University of Michigan survey indicated across-the-board improvements, with the headline index of consumer sentiment reaching 60.5, exceeding expectations. Consumers' outlook for near-term inflation also decreased, though concerns remain about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical issues. The improvement coincided with a softening in the rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, but sentiment indexes remain below year-ago readings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its health business into six new units after a series of executive departures, aiming to simplify the structure and accelerate innovation. The company has tapped longtime Amazon leaders and promoted One Medical executives to oversee the divisions, with Neil Lindsay leading the overhaul. This reorganization follows Amazon's ambitious efforts to penetrate the U.S. health-care market through acquisitions like PillPack and One Medical, and the closure of telehealth service Amazon Care. The new structure focuses on One Medical clinical care, operations, strategic growth, tech, compliance, and pharmacy services. </p>

          <p>Shares of RH, formerly Restoration Hardware, experienced a significant jump after the company maintained its sales forecast and outlined measures to counteract the effects of higher tariffs. Despite facing challenges in the real estate market and navigating increased tariff costs, the luxury furniture retailer anticipates full-year revenue growth between 10% and 13%. The company is shifting more production out of China, expecting receipts from the country to decrease substantially, and is also delaying the launch of a new concept until 2026. RH is also continuing its plans to open stores in other countries, including a location on Paris' Champs √âlys√©es. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing severe hay fever symptoms for many individuals. The warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major trigger, and recent dry days have spread pollen through the air, creating a 'pollen bomb'. While there's no cure, treatments include antihistamine tablets, steroid nasal sprays, and eye drops, and experts recommend avoiding triggers and maintaining good hygiene to reduce symptoms. Immunotherapy treatment might be available for the worst affected, though the NHS stopped offering steroid injections due to the risk of serious side-effects.</p>
