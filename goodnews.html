          <p>Oracle experienced a historic stock surge, closing nearly 36% higher and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This marks the company's best single-day performance since 1992, driven by a staggering report of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. The massive backlog is attributed to immense demand for its cloud infrastructure, fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. Despite missing quarterly revenue and earnings estimates, the overwhelming cloud demand and future revenue projections have cemented investor confidence in Oracle's position as a key player in the AI sector.

          <p>Former football star and presenter Gary Lineker has won the award for best TV presenter at the UK's National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. The victory comes shortly after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" program following controversies related to his social media use. In his acceptance speech, Lineker thanked his colleagues and stated the award demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for others. The win was a major upset at the viewer-voted awards ceremony, where the popular reality show "The Traitors" also surprisingly went home empty-handed.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was gathered from the edge of an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater. It exhibits mineral patterns and textures that, on Earth, are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While nonbiological explanations cannot be ruled out, researchers are excited about the finding and emphasize the need to bring the sample back to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>A disruptive weekend bus strike planned for London has been mostly called off after a majority of workers accepted a new pay offer. The strike, organized by the Unite union, was set to affect about 60 routes in north-west and south-west London. Employees of the bus company London United voted to accept the deal, canceling their walkout. However, some industrial action may still occur on a small number of routes operated by London Transit if ongoing negotiations do not reach a resolution. The news provides relief for London commuters who have already faced significant travel chaos from an ongoing Tube strike.</p>

          <p>Boeing and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union have reached a tentative five-year labor agreement, potentially ending a strike that began in early August. The deal, which includes improved wages and a restored signing bonus, will be voted on by the more than 3,000 striking union members this Friday. The workers, primarily based in St. Louis, are responsible for assembling and maintaining F-15 fighter jets and missile systems. This strike was the first in nearly 30 years for this unit, following the rejection of a previous contract offer from the aerospace and defense giant.</p>

          <p>In a new documentary, actor Charlie Sheen shared details of a family-led intervention in the early 1990s, revealing that a phone call from Clint Eastwood was the final push he needed to seek treatment for substance abuse. Sheen described being surprised by a gathering of family and friends, including Rob Lowe, after being told he was attending his father Martin Sheen's birthday party. After listening to emotional appeals, Sheen was still hesitant until his father handed him the phone. Eastwood's powerful words of encouragement, telling him he was "worth saving," convinced the actor to agree to go to rehab.</p>

          <p>As the mortgage rate climate begins to cool, with average 30-year rates falling to an 11-month low of 6.50%, prospective homebuyers may be able to secure a rate below 6%. This article outlines several strategies, including considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently average just under 6% for a 7/1 ARM. Another key tactic is to diligently shop around with multiple lenders, as this can often yield rates up to a full percentage point lower than the national average. Finally, strategically timing the market around anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts could present brief windows of opportunity for lower rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates this month, savers should consider how this will affect returns on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. This article explains that CDs, with their fixed interest rates, are better positioned to lock in current high returns before rates fall further. Once a CD is opened, its rate is guaranteed for the entire term. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely decrease following a Fed cut. The choice depends on the saver's goals: CDs offer predictable returns at the cost of liquidity, while savings accounts provide flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council reveals that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report underscores the deep economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral trade having grown nearly fivefold in two decades. While exports to China, primarily soybeans, iron ore, and oil, generate higher-paying jobs, they are concentrated among fewer than 3,000 companies. This concentration raises concerns about Brazil's economic exposure and reliance on a small number of commodities and a single major trading partner. (not investment advice)</p>

The report, based on provisional data, shows heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, with both seeing a slight increase in total deaths from the previous year. Unintentional injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease were also among the leading causes. The data signals a significant shift in the nation's public health landscape post-pandemic.</p>

As the only cabinet member in the race, Phillipson is seen as an establishment candidate who would be supportive of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government.
