          <p>Twenty companies in Japan have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of government-stockpiled rice, following an announcement by the farm minister to release rice through direct contracts to lower prices. This amount represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release, bypassing the auction system. The move aims to address the doubling of rice prices at supermarkets compared to the previous year, despite previous government efforts.

          <p>A Chinese study published in Cell challenges Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without DNA changes. Rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on tolerance to low temperatures across five generations through DNA methylation changes. This research revives the rivalry between Lamarck's theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics and Darwin's random genetic variation. The study suggests that Lamarckism plays a significant role in evolution, positioning environmentally induced epigenetic variation as a key factor.</p>
