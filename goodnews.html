          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, which includes restarting inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal, announced after a meeting in Cairo, is seen as a crucial step toward de-escalation, though details remain limited. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi called it "a step in the right direction," while Iran's foreign minister warned the agreement would be terminated if hostile acts, such as the reimposition of UN sanctions, occur. This development comes amid heightened tensions after Western nations threatened new sanctions over Iran's non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

This milestone blast moved him past legendary Hall of Fame catcher Yogi Berra. The 412-foot homer, his 44th of the season, continues Judge's ascent in the Yankees' record books. He now trails only Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, and Babe Ruth, further cementing his legacy within one of baseball's most storied franchises and its history of iconic sluggers.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw has won the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in a reliably Democratic district where federal employee job cuts under the Trump administration were a key issue. His victory fills a critical vacancy ahead of a looming government shutdown deadline and continues a trend of Democratic overperformance in recent special elections across the country, providing a boost to the party's morale.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock soared after the company released forward-looking revenue projections that far exceeded expectations, driven by massive growth in its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. Despite missing current quarterly earnings, analysts were stunned by the forecast, which projects cloud infrastructure revenue to jump 77% this fiscal year. The company also reported signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts, including a major data center deal with OpenAI, leading to a 359% increase in remaining performance obligations. This outlook signals a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish buy-now, pay-later company Klarna has priced its Initial Public Offering at $40 per share, surpassing its initial range and securing a valuation of approximately $15 billion. The company raised $1.37 billion in the offering, with most proceeds going to existing shareholders. Klarna's successful IPO on the New York Stock Exchange reflects strong investor appetite for technology stocks and serves as a significant test for the digital banking and consumer finance sector. The move comes after the company delayed its public debut earlier in the year due to market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed on over 1,000 people in the UK, a development that could revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test detects biomarkers for the rogue proteins associated with Alzheimer's and is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90%. Led by University College London, the study will assess how the test works within the NHS, potentially speeding up diagnosis and allowing earlier access to treatments. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could replace more invasive and costly methods like PET scans and lumbar punctures.</p>

          <p>New Mexico has announced it will become the first state in the nation to provide free, universal childcare for all residents, regardless of income. The initiative expands an existing program that offered no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which has already been credited with reducing poverty. This groundbreaking policy is expected to provide families with an average annual savings of $12,000 per child, supporting family stability and workforce participation. The state is also investing in childcare facilities and recruitment, establishing a program that public health experts are calling a "model for the nation."</p>

          <p>The METRO bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a major overhaul that led to a 24% increase in ridership. The transformation was driven by actively listening to passenger feedback, which resulted in redrawn routes, increased frequency to every 15 minutes on key lines, and expanded seven-day-a-week service. The agency, led by a former bus driver, achieved these improvements without a budget increase by optimizing its existing resources. This passenger-centric approach has revitalized public transportation in the city and is being hailed as a model for other transit systems.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at compelling pharmaceutical companies to comply with transparency laws in their advertising, especially on social media platforms. The action will be followed by hundreds of cease-and-desist letters to enforce existing regulations that require clear disclosure of drug risks and side effects. Administration officials highlighted the issue of social media influencers promoting medications without identifying themselves as paid spokespeople. The policy seeks to level the playing field by ensuring online promotions adhere to the same standards as traditional advertising, addressing what some industry leaders see as a promotional "arms race."</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed scrapping the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. If approved, the change would empower banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects the growing consumer preference for contactless methods, it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would only permit higher-value payments for transactions deemed low-risk.</p>

          <p>Despite a general slowdown in corporate share repurchases, investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively buy back their own stock, according to market analysis. This strategy can provide an edge, as consistent buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can boost earnings per share and signal management's confidence in the company's future. Companies with a long history of reducing their share count, dubbed "buyback aristocrats," have shown a tendency to outperform, particularly when the broader economy is slowing down.
