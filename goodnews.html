        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The aviation industry is projected to improve in profitability in 2025, despite a forecasted drop in global GDP growth. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects revenue, operating profits, and net profits to increase, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are predicted to reach an all-time high of 84%, while jet fuel costs are expected to average $86 per barrel, down from $99 in 2024. The IATA noted minimal fuel hedging activity, suggesting airlines will benefit from the reduced fuel costs.</p>
