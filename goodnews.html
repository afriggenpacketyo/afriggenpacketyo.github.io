          <p>The CDC has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a significant surge of the virus in China. The variant has been found in international travelers arriving at airports in multiple states, as well as in other states separate from the airport cases. While Hong Kong authorities say there is no evidence that the variant is more severe, they have urged residents to mask in public. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 has a greater ability to bind to human cells, potentially increasing its transmissibility. The FDA's vaccine advisers discussed whether to update COVID-19 vaccines for the coming seasons, with early data suggesting that a vaccine targeting the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 could boost protection against NB.1.8.1.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investing in gold can be a prudent strategy, especially amidst economic uncertainty, but beginners should consider several factors before diving in. Physical gold carries storage and premium costs, making gold ETFs a more efficient entry point for new investors. While gold is considered a safe-haven asset, its price is influenced by various factors, making it essential to view it as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity. Investors should be cautious of scams and high premiums, opting for reputable dealers or well-known ETF platforms with low expense ratios. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ETF market is expected to experience a surge in new product launches due to a change from the SEC allowing mutual fund managers to offer an ETF share class of their existing funds. This could lead to a doubling of the number of ETFs available, creating a challenge for investors to navigate the expanded landscape. While many of the new ETFs will be traditional asset allocation products, there are concerns about the history of active managers struggling to beat the index. Investors should be cautious about new, straight-to-ETF strategies, particularly those involving illiquid securities, and consider whether the ETF structure is the right fit for the investment idea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. The orders call for a "total and complete reform" of the NRC, requiring decisions on nuclear reactor licenses within 18 months. The focus is on small, advanced reactors, but the administration also supports building large plants. The orders also establish a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct nuclear reactors on federal land and seek to boost uranium mining and domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>

          <p>The Lebanese government will begin disarming armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps starting in June, signaling a move to assert state control over weapons. This action is considered a trial run before tackling the more significant challenge of disarming Hezbollah, the powerful Iran-backed Lebanese militia. The decision follows a weakening of Iran-backed militias in the region after recent wars with Israel. President Joseph Aoun has vowed to disarm both Hezbollah and Palestinian armed factions, with a formal agreement reached with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to support the disarmament of the camps.</p>

He has also accused Harris and Xavier Becerra of helping cover up President Biden's decline in office.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court ruling prevented the nation's first religious charter school from opening in Oklahoma, but conservatives may still achieve their goals through a school voucher program passed by the House. The legislation sets aside $5 billion to fund vouchers for families to use for private school tuition, home-schooling, or virtual learning, potentially benefiting religious education. While voucher advocates once focused on low-income students, they are now pushing for vouchers for most everyone, backed by powerful conservative donors.
