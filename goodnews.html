          <p>A United Airlines flight was forced to divert to Salt Lake City after an unknown object struck its windshield at 36,000 feet, causing a crack and minor injury to the pilot. Amidst the mystery of the impact, WindBorne Systems, a long-duration smart weather balloon company, released a statement suggesting the object may have been one of their weather balloons. The company is actively cooperating with the FAA and NTSB on the investigation, implementing immediate changes to minimize time spent between 30,000 and 40,000 feet, and accelerating plans for autonomous plane avoidance using live flight data. This article details how aircraft windshields are designed to withstand various impacts, making this incident at such a high altitude particularly puzzling for aviation experts. Passengers were accommodated on another flight, and the cracked windshield is now with the NTSB laboratory.</p>

          <p>Miami Beach is launching "Reefline," an ambitious seven-mile-long artificial reef project that uniquely combines art installation with vital coral habitat restoration. This innovative initiative, partially funded by a $5 million voter-approved bond, aims to create an accessible underwater sculpture garden made from marine-grade concrete, which will eventually be transformed into a vibrant, living coral reef. Colin Foord, co-founder of Coral Morphologic, is cultivating resilient coral species to transplant onto the structures, including an initial installation of 22 concrete-cast cars. This article highlights the long-term vision for Reefline, anticipating a decade for completion and hoping it becomes a new symbol for the city. The project seeks to renew Miami Beach's lost offshore coral reef, educate visitors through an onshore marine learning center, and establish a distinctive ecotourism attraction visible even from the air.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured their first World Series appearance since 1993 by defeating the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a thrilling Game 7 of the ALCS. George Springer delivered a pivotal three-run home run in the seventh inning, turning a 3-1 deficit into a 4-3 lead, marking a historic go-ahead homer in Game 7 history when a team trailed by multiple runs late in the game. Toronto will now host the Los Angeles Dodgers, who swept the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS, in Game 1 of the World Series. This article highlights the Blue Jays' quest for their third franchise title against the defending champion Dodgers, who are looking to repeat and secure their ninth title. The Mariners, despite solo home runs from Cal Raleigh and Julio Rodríguez, remain the only major league team without a pennant, leaving their fans heartbroken.</p>

          <p>Running back Jahmyr Gibbs delivered a spectacular performance, accumulating a career-high 218 yards from scrimmage and scoring two touchdowns, leading the Detroit Lions to a dominant 24-9 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Gibbs' explosive night included a 78-yard sprint and a five-yard spinning plunge, showcasing his immense talent that coach Dan Campbell noted had been "building." This victory extends the Lions' impressive NFL-long streak of 51 games without consecutive regular season losses, demonstrating their resilience and ability to bounce back. The article highlights Gibbs' exceptional versatility, making him the first NFL player since 2009 with over 135 rushing and 80 receiving yards alongside two ground scores. Despite quarterback Jared Goff's early turnovers, the Lions' short-handed defense effectively contained the Buccaneers, securing a crucial win and improving their record to 5-2.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have urged the Supreme Court to uphold a lower court's order blocking the deployment of the National Guard into Chicago by the Trump administration. They argue that the administration's push to lift the order relies on "mischaracterizations" of facts, asserting that state and local law enforcement have effectively managed isolated protest activities. With the temporary restraining order set to expire, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul encouraged the court to maintain the current arrangement, which allows federalization but prohibits deployment into Chicago. This article emphasizes that this approach safeguards the careful balance of power between the federal government and states concerning the "militia," as apportioned by the Constitution, while a fast-moving case proceeds in the lower courts.</p>

President Suresh Garimella stated that principles like academic freedom, merit-based research funding, and institutional independence are foundational and must be preserved, asserting the university's commitment to competing for federal research strictly on merit. The compact's demands include reforms to admissions and hiring practices regarding race and ethnicity, strict definitions of gender, and a 15% cap on international undergraduates. This article highlights that six other prominent universities have also declined the proposal, underscoring widespread concerns about academic freedom and institutional autonomy within higher education.

          <p>Despite a seemingly friendly first official meeting between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Australia harbors "creeping doubts" about the reliability of its long-standing ally. Trump's past sweeping tariffs, the initial review of the landmark Aukus defense pact, and difficulties in securing the meeting had fueled significant distrust among Australians. Albanese ultimately secured renewed commitment to Aukus and a critical minerals investment deal, aimed at countering China's market dominance. This article highlights that while the immediate outcomes of the meeting were positive, polling consistently shows Trump is unpopular in Australia, and fewer Australians view the US as a reliable ally under his leadership. However, China's significant military build-up in the region reinforces the perceived necessity of the US alliance, despite the growing uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The Aukus security pact is a multi-billion dollar defense deal between Australia, the UK, and the US, primarily focused on providing Australia with nuclear-powered attack submarines. The deal, worth £176bn ($239bn; A$368bn) over 30 years, involves Australia initially purchasing three US Virginia-class submarines from 2032, followed by the design and construction of an entirely new trilateral submarine model in Britain and Australia. Pillar two of Aukus focuses on sharing advanced military capabilities, including long-range hypersonic missiles, undersea robotics, and AI. This article highlights that the pact is fundamentally aimed at countering China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific region, significantly upgrading Australia's military capabilities and allowing for long-range strikes against enemies for the first time.

          <p>St. Johns, Michigan, a town of roughly 8,000 people, has begun regulating golf cart usage on public roads due to escalating safety concerns, as thousands of carts now share streets with regular traffic. The city's new ordinance restricts carts to roads with speed limits of 25 mph or lower and mandates inspections for working turn signals and horns, with drivers needing to be at least 18 years old and hold a valid license. Mayor Scott Dzurka highlighted the potential for "disastrous" outcomes if golf carts are involved in accidents due to their lack of protection. This article explains that the booming golf cart market is largely driven by lifestyle convenience rather than golf, with businesses even selling accessories like snow plows, necessitating these new safety measures to protect both cart users and other motorists.</p>

          <p>Childhood peanut allergy rates have significantly dropped, with an estimated 40,000 children avoiding diagnoses, following revised guidelines recommending early exposure to the allergen for babies. A study published in the journal Pediatrics found a remarkable 43% reduction in peanut allergy rates for children under three after 2017, when recommendations expanded to include all infants. This article highlights that the shift in guidance, reversing decades of avoidance advice, was based on a watershed 2015 study that showed feeding peanut products to babies reduced allergy chances by over 80%. Despite only a fraction of pediatricians fully adopting the new approach, the "magnitude of the results" is deemed "incredible," underscoring the effectiveness of early introduction in preventing food allergies and calling for further policy changes, such as including peanut products in infant food packages.</p>
