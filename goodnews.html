          <p>The U.S. stock market achieved record highs this week, driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq saw significant gains as investors reacted positively to the central bank's signal of potential future cuts. This article provides a weekly overview, also covering key company news, including a major partnership between Nvidia and Intel, strong early demand for Apple's new iPhone models, and CrowdStrike's optimistic long-term financial outlook.

The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable training program, were reunited with their family in Qatar before flying to London. While the Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws, no specific reason for their detention was ever disclosed, and their release was secured following negotiations brokered by Qatar.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising newly acquired "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major operational decisions like plant closures. After the company informed nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, the administration warned it would not be permitted, forcing U.S. Steel to reverse its decision and continue operations.

          <p>In an interview with The Atlantic, Monica Lewinsky discussed her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that after realizing she could not escape her past, she decided to become a "poster child for having survived shame," a turning point inspired by the tragic death of Tyler Clementi. Lewinsky reflected on how cultural perspectives have shifted, particularly with the #MeToo movement and a younger generation's ability to see the power imbalance in her situation with President Bill Clinton.</p>

          <p>A lengthy phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has been described by both sides as constructive, raising hopes for greater stability in the relationship. The leaders discussed key issues including trade frictions and reached an agreement on the control of TikTok. Trump announced plans for a face-to-face meeting at the upcoming APEC summit and a visit to China early next year, though analysts remain cautious, pointing to unresolved tensions over Taiwan and potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, citing the high cost of U.S. higher education and domestic political turmoil as primary motivations. Data shows a significant increase in students studying abroad, with educational consultants reporting a massive spike in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the affordability of international tuition, which can be significantly lower than in the U.S., is a key factor, alongside the desire for a different cultural and political environment.</p>
