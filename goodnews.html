          <p>The Church of England has historically appointed Sarah Mullally as the next Archbishop of Canterbury, making her the first woman to hold the prestigious position in its history. Mullally, who has served as the bishop of London since 2018, will succeed Justin Welby, who resigned following criticism over his handling of abuse allegations. She will officially become the 106th Archbishop after her election is confirmed in January 2026. The appointment is a landmark moment for the Church of England and the global Anglican Communion, which includes over 85 million members.</p>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are increasingly replacing paper price tags in major U.S. grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, centralized price updates. While retailers claim the technology improves efficiency and helps manage inventory, some lawmakers have raised concerns that it could enable "dynamic pricing," where prices surge during peak demand. Major retailers like Kroger and Amazon have denied any plans to implement surge pricing, stating the technology helps reduce food waste by allowing them to quickly lower prices on perishable items.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the Fort Worth Zoo are leading an ambitious conservation effort to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction through assisted reproduction techniques. By injecting hormones and carefully managing genetics, they are breeding thousands of toads in captivity for release into the wild. This initiative is coupled with a broader strategy involving private landowners in Texas, who receive tax incentives for restoring the toad's native habitat by clearing invasive plants. These combined efforts have shown early signs of success, with the wild population beginning to rebound from near-extinction.</p>

          <p>A viral food trend known as "Dubai chocolate" has become ubiquitous, appearing in stores and on social media platforms like TikTok. The confection, a chocolate bar filled with pistachio cream and crunchy knafeh pastry, was created in 2021 by Dubai-based Fix Dessert Chocolatier and gained global fame through influencer videos. Its popularity is attributed to its visually appealing, "ASMR-friendly" qualities and an association with luxury, despite its high price point. The trend reflects a broader pattern of social media driving consumer demand for novel, often ostentatious, food experiences.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England men's national football team for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. However, manager Thomas Tuchel has controversially omitted other prominent players, including Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish, from the squad. The decision reflects Tuchel's desire for continuity, keeping faith with the players who secured a decisive 5-0 victory over Serbia in the previous international window. The selections have sparked debate, particularly the exclusion of in-form players like Foden and Grealish.</p>

          <p>As the Las Vegas Aces and Phoenix Mercury prepare to face off in the WNBA Finals, sports writers are analyzing the matchup and making their predictions. The Aces' journey is credited to the dominant performance of four-time MVP A'ja Wilson and a rediscovered defensive identity. The Mercury's success is attributed to their tough team defense, the resilience of veterans like Alyssa Thomas, and the coaching of Nate Tibbetts. While most writers predict a close series, the consensus slightly favors the experience and star power of the Las Vegas Aces to win the championship.</p>

          <p>United States Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino defended his practice of not explaining to players why they were left off the roster, stating that players should intuitively understand their performance level. Speaking ahead of friendlies against Ecuador and Australia, he emphasized that no player has a guaranteed spot for the 2026 World Cup and that selection is based on current form and adherence to the team's culture. The latest squad sees the return of several players like Weston McKennie and Cameron Carter-Vickers, while others who have been playing well for their clubs were notably excluded.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents China's extensive high-speed railway system as a revolutionary achievement that should inspire other nations to reinvest in passenger rail. It contrasts the modern efficiency of Chinese rail, which can complete a journey from Beijing to Xian in just four hours, with the much slower and less comfortable train travel of the past. The author argues that while air travel has dominated passenger transport, China's success demonstrates the potential for high-speed rail to be a modern, efficient, and transformative mode of transportation for the 21st century.</p>

          <p>Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, 70, is abdicating the throne after a 25-year reign, with his son, the 43-year-old Guillaume, set to be enthroned as the new head of state. The transition of power in the world's last grand duchy will be marked by a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace, attended by European royalty and political leaders. While the role is largely ceremonial, the change in leadership is a significant event for the small, wealthy European nation. The new Grand Duke Guillaume is not expected to make major changes but is anticipated to bring a slightly warmer touch to the role.</p>

          <p>Two remote atolls in the Marshall Islands, Bikar and Jemo, are experiencing a remarkable ecological recovery after a successful program to eradicate invasive rats. The rodents had decimated native bird, turtle, and crab populations and destroyed vegetation. A year after conservationists used drones to distribute targeted bait, the islands are now rat-free, with seabird colonies returning, native tree seedlings sprouting, and previously suppressed species reappearing. The project serves as a powerful example of how removing invasive species can allow fragile island ecosystems to regenerate and thrive.</p>

          <p>This article explores the continuing relevance of the Nobel Prizes, questioning whether the century-old awards accurately reflect how modern science operates. While the prizes successfully popularize major scientific breakthroughs, they face criticism for perpetuating the "genius scientist" myth, overlooking the collaborative nature of research. Furthermore, the awards are scrutinized for a historical lack of diversity, with a significant bias toward male laureates from institutions in the United States and Europe. The discussion weighs the prize's inspirational value against its perceived shortcomings in representing the global scientific community.</p>
