          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn reported a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, significantly beating analyst forecasts. This strong performance was primarily driven by its booming artificial intelligence server business, which for the first time surpassed consumer electronics as the largest source of revenue. The company, a key partner to Nvidia, anticipates its AI server revenue will grow over 170% year-over-year, though it remains watchful of evolving global economic and political conditions, including potential U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization. Analysts suggest this move could enhance counterterrorism cooperation between the United States and China, via Pakistan, as the BLA has previously targeted Chinese interests. The designation is seen as a commitment by the Trump administration to combat terrorism and may help alleviate Beijing's security concerns in the region. This action is viewed as a critical step in curtailing support for the group's activities.</p>

          <p>This article provides an explainer on BTecs (Business and Technology Education Council qualifications), which are practical, vocational alternatives to traditional academic routes like A-levels in the UK. It details the different levels, the grading system from Pass to Starred Distinction, and their role in pathways to university or employment. The article also touches on recent government policy changes under the Labour government that have paused previous plans to scrap many BTecs, securing their funding for the near future.</p>

          <p>The UK economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the previous quarter but better than the 0.1% growth that economists had forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the main drivers of this unexpected resilience. While the government hailed the figures as positive, some economists expressed doubt that this pace of growth could be maintained amid global uncertainty and potential tax rises.

          <p>An episode of the "Throughline" podcast revisits the history of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. The story focuses on the efforts of a young lawyer who, in the years before President John F. Kennedy's assassination, recognized a critical gap in the Constitution. The amendment, a key component of governmental stability, provides a clear framework for what should happen if a U.S. president is no longer able to serve.</p>

          <p>South Korea's highest court has dismissed a copyright infringement lawsuit against The Pinkfong Company, the creator of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had claimed the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition was not a substantial modification of the traditional folk tune, which is in the public domain, and thus did not qualify for copyright protection.</p>

          <p>A startup named Voltify is pursuing the ambitious goal of decarbonizing the U.S. freight rail industry by convincing major railroad companies to adopt its battery technology. The company's business model involves using "VoltCars," which are essentially large batteries on wheels that connect to existing diesel locomotives, reducing emissions and fuel costs. Despite skepticism from the traditional industry, Voltify is in active talks with several major railroads and plans to launch a pilot project in early 2026.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the proportion of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. The decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among younger adults, that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. Researchers suggest this shift is driven by increased health awareness, social changes, and the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives, with young people leading the trend away from regular alcohol consumption in the U.S.</p>
