          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he played for 11 seasons. The deal is said to include a player option and a no-trade clause, signaling a strong commitment from both sides. This reunion comes after Lillard was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks, where he spent one season. Despite being expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles surgery, Lillard chose to return to Portland, where his family resides, over offers from other contending teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's rare earth exports to China increased threefold, while its overall trade surplus with the nation significantly narrowed. According to a report from the China-Brazil Business Council, this shift reflects China's strategy to diversify its sources for strategic minerals and the broader ripple effects of U.S.-China trade tensions. Analysts suggest that as Washington and Beijing impose stricter trade barriers on each other, emerging economies like Brazil are absorbing the impact and seeing their trade patterns rerouted. This trend underscores the evolving global supply chain in response to geopolitical pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Cinematographer Darius Khondji Discusses His Chameleonic Approach to Filmmaking</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:45:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Esteemed cinematographer Darius Khondji, known for his work on films like "Seven," "Uncut Gems," and the new "Eddington," describes his artistic process as being like a chameleon, fully embracing the vision of each director he collaborates with. In a recent interview, the 69-year-old artist reflects on a career defined by its eclecticism and feeling-based approach to creating images. Collaborators like Ari Aster and Alejandro González Iñárritu praise his ability to subordinate technical choices to the emotional needs of a film. Khondji remains a vital force in cinema, bridging generations of filmmakers with his poetic and intuitive visual style.</p>

          <p>Netflix reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2025, with revenue growing by 16% to $11.08 billion and earnings per share beating analyst expectations. The company attributed the robust performance to a combination of increased membership, higher subscription prices, and growing advertising revenue. In response to the positive results and a weaker U.S. dollar, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast. However, the company also warned that operating margins would likely be lower in the second half of the year due to higher costs associated with its upcoming slate of content.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the Genius Act, a landmark bill creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation, which previously passed the Senate with bipartisan support, establishes rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies and aims to provide consumer protection. Proponents argue that clear regulations will foster innovation, making digital currency transactions faster and cheaper. This move is a significant step toward integrating cryptocurrencies into the mainstream U.S. financial system and aligns with the Trump administration's pro-crypto stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's emergence as a dependable All-Star this season is credited to the confidence he gained during last year's high-pressure playoffs. After an inconsistent rookie season, a pivotal scoreless performance in a deciding playoff game against the Padres transformed his self-belief. The Japanese right-hander also dedicated his off-season to strengthening his body and adjusting to the demands of Major League Baseball, including the pitching schedule and travel. Now a key part of the Dodgers' rotation, Yamamoto's growth reflects his ability to learn from both failure and success.</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement of President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The condition occurs when veins in the legs struggle to pump blood back to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, achiness, and varicose veins. CVI is common in older adults, and risk factors include age, blood clots, and being overweight. While the condition itself is often benign, doctors must first rule out more serious causes of leg swelling, such as heart or kidney disease, typically using ultrasound exams to confirm the diagnosis.</p>

Despite challenging morning weather and slow play that stretched rounds to six hours, top players like Scottie Scheffler positioned themselves just one shot off the lead.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after he experienced swelling in his legs. A memo from the White House physician described the condition as "benign and common" in people over 70 and confirmed that more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis were ruled out. The announcement came after days of public speculation fueled by photographs showing bruising on the president's hand and swollen legs. The press secretary attributed the hand bruising to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use, stating that the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

Housed in the Main Street Opera House, the show aims to present the man behind the global company. The creation of the robotic figure has been a topic of curiosity and controversy, with some, including Disney's granddaughter, questioning whether he would have wanted to be immortalized this way. Imagineers stressed the immense detail involved, from sculpting hands based on molds to studying film to replicate his mannerisms, in what they call their most lifelike figure to date.</p>

His performance was a stark contrast to his disastrous opening round at the same course in 2019, showing a newfound tenacity.
