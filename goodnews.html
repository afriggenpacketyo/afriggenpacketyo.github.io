          <p>Scientists in China have successfully modernized an ancient chromium plating technology, first used on bronze swords buried with the Terracotta Army over 2,000 years ago. This refined technique creates a protective layer that combats the extreme heat, pressure, and chemical erosion inside modern artillery barrels. According to a defense technology journal, this innovation has effectively doubled the service life of high-pressure cannons, providing a cutting-edge solution to a persistent military engineering challenge.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street estimates, even as net income declined 23% year-over-year due to lower global oil prices. The company's performance was bolstered by record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, reaching its highest second-quarter output in over 25 years. Exxon also highlighted its successful cost-cutting measures and returned $9.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

          <p>Chevron's second-quarter earnings exceeded analyst predictions, though its net income fell by approximately 44% from the previous year because of declining crude oil prices. The company achieved record worldwide production, driven by a jump in U.S. output. A key factor in its future outlook is the recently completed $53 billion acquisition of Hess, which is expected to begin adding to earnings in the fourth quarter after a contentious arbitration battle with Exxon Mobil was resolved.

Now operating as a nonprofit, the company had its best year ever in 2024, demonstrating the enduring appeal of artisanal goods in an age of automation and artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have agreed to a new partnership to jointly develop Pakistan's oil reserves, part of a broader effort to expand economic and trade ties. The announcement came alongside a new trade agreement that lowers the U.S. tariff rate on Pakistani imports from 29% to 19%. While the extent of Pakistan's "massive" reserves is unclear, the deal is seen as a strategic move to foster economic cooperation and potentially counterbalance China's influence in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a five-year pilot program to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. The plan, which is similar to one proposed by the prior administration, aims to address the U.S. obesity crisis but raises concerns about the high cost of these medications to the public purse. The initiative would permit state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover these GLP-1 drugs for weight management starting in 2026.</p>

          <p>The White House has sent letters to 17 major pharmaceutical firms, demanding they provide "binding commitments" to lower U.S. prescription drug prices to "most favored nation" levels by September 29. The ultimatum requires companies to match the lowest prices offered in other developed countries for Medicaid patients and to sell directly to consumers, bypassing pharmacy benefit managers. The administration warned it would use every available tool to combat "abusive drug pricing practices" if the companies do not comply.</p>
