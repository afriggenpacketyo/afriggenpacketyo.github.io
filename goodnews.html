        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysts, the Chinese government's efforts to control a damaging price war in the solar-equipment industry are beginning to show positive results. Initiatives, including proposed limits on power use for manufacturing, have led to a recovery in prices for solar products like polysilicon. This price stabilization is expected to help leading manufacturers return to profitability after experiencing significant losses for the past 18 months. The policy changes are seen as a move toward industry consolidation and market stability.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Current forecasts predict the storm will remain over open water, tracking north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. While it is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land, meteorologists suggest it could strengthen into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The system may bring some impacts to Bermuda by early next week as it continues its path northward.</p>

The amendment directs the State Department to report on the impact of these staff cuts and to consult regularly with Congress to ensure accountability on this critical issue.</p>

The team, which has led the league in attendance every year since 2013, will officially cross the threshold during its final regular-season game. This achievement is attributed to the team's consistent on-field success and a star-studded roster, which was further boosted by the off-season signing of global superstar Shohei Ohtani. No MLB team has reached the 4-million mark since 2008.</p>
