          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to address his recent struggles, focusing on better pitch location to avoid leaving pitches in the middle of the strike zone. Despite a high percentage of pitches in the strike zone, hitters are making solid contact, leading to blown saves and increased ERA. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the Dodgers, and the coaching staff is encouraging him to prioritize getting swings and misses, even if it means more walks. The goal is to restore Scott's effectiveness and stabilize the bullpen during a period of numerous injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools, citing concerns about antisemitism and foreign student lists. This proposal follows previous actions by the administration to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard, escalating a battle rooted in claims that the university tolerates antisemitism and promotes liberal ideology. The suggestion to fund trade schools, which specialize in practical skills, contrasts with the scientific research typically conducted at Harvard. The move has been met with both support from trade school advocates and continued scrutiny over the administration's approach to higher education funding.</p>
