          <p>Australia's immigration minister confirmed that the entry visa for the American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, has been revoked. The decision followed the release of his pro-Nazi song "Heil Hitler," which contains antisemitic lyrics and samples a speech by the Nazi leader. The minister explained that while most visa cancellations are for public advocacy, an exception was made due to the song's promotion of Nazism, stating that Australia does not need to import such bigotry. This action is not a permanent ban, as any future visa applications from Ye, who is married to an Australian citizen, will be reassessed individually.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a hospital in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke about the difficult recovery phase following cancer treatment. She described how patients often put on a "brave face" during chemotherapy, only to find the period after treatment is a significant challenge where they can no longer function as they once did. The princess emphasized that this post-treatment phase is a life-changing experience for both patients and their families, requiring time to find a "new normal" on what is often a rollercoaster journey. Her comments are seen as an important message of support for other cancer survivors facing similar struggles in their recovery.</p>

          <p>New Zealand is experiencing a significant increase in applications for its Active Investor Plus visa, often called a "golden visa," particularly from wealthy Americans. Since the government relaxed rules in April, such as removing an English language requirement, 189 applications have been received in under three months, compared to 116 over the previous two and a half years. Nearly half of the new applicants are U.S. citizens, with observers suggesting that global uncertainty, including political polarization in the U.S., is driving the trend. Proponents highlight New Zealand's stability, scenery, and favorable tax environment as key attractions for those seeking a safe haven.</p>

In 2024, China's marine GDP surpassed 10 trillion yuan for the first time, contributing 7.8% to the national total, a milestone celebrated by the government. This sector encompasses a wide range of industries, including offshore energy, marine transportation, coastal tourism, and fisheries.

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates has spurred a wave of homeowners to refinance their loans. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan jumped 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same week a year ago. The average contract interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, its lowest level since April. While refinancing activity surged, particularly for conventional and VA loans, applications for home purchases remained flat. This suggests that while existing homeowners are capitalizing on lower rates, prospective buyers are still hesitant amid ongoing market uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The mission, launched in January, is designed to test technologies for on-orbit refueling and extending the lifespan of satellites, a capability the United States has not yet achieved.

This goal is intended to be a stepping stone toward the EU's legally binding commitment to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To provide flexibility for industries, the proposal includes a provision allowing carbon credits from non-EU countries to account for up to 3% of the overall reduction starting in 2036.

While little change in strength is anticipated in the immediate future, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict that rapid weakening will begin by the end of the day.

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, the China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus view that China's consumption is underdeveloped. In a new report, researchers argue that mainstream metrics systematically underestimate the country's true consumption level. While unadjusted data shows China's per capita spending is a fraction of that in developed nations, the think tank contends that the real level may already be 40 to 50 percent of that in countries like Japan and Germany. This alternative perspective suggests that the consumer potential of the world's second-largest economy may be significantly greater than commonly believed. (not investment advice)</p>

He explicitly stated that "no-one else has any authority to interfere in this matter," a clear rebuke to Beijing, which has insisted it must approve his successor.
