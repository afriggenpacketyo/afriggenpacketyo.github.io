          <p>Former county cricketer Arul Suppiah has spoken about his struggle with anorexia, an eating disorder often associated with young women but which affected him in his 30s. What began as a health kick in 2017 spiraled into excessive exercising, minimal eating, and avoidance of social situations involving food. After nearly fainting at work, he was advised to take time off, and faced the threat of being sectioned under the Mental Health Act if he didn't improve. Suppiah, now 41, managed to turn things around, but not without significant difficulty.</p>

Internal affairs minister Seiichiro Murakami emphasized the importance of enhancing media literacy, urging skepticism and verification before spreading information.

The agreement involves temporarily halting the majority of tariffs on each other's products for 90 days, reducing mutual tariffs from 125% to 10%. UBS now projects China's GDP growth in 2025 could climb to between 3.7% and 4%, up from a previous estimate of 3.4%.

          <p>Following trade talks between the United States and China, tariff rates have been reduced, but the overall picture remains complex. While headline changes suggest a shift to 30% tariffs on Chinese goods and 10% on American exports, these rates do not include previous tariffs from earlier trade war iterations. The effective tariff rate for Chinese exporters is estimated at around 50%, factoring in both new and existing duties. This analysis helps clarify the actual costs faced by manufacturers and exporters amidst ongoing trade tensions.</p>

However, a broad decline in interest rates now poses a challenge to these fintechs, raising doubts about the sustainability of relying on heightened income. Some fintechs are diversifying revenue streams to reduce dependence on interest and card fees, and those with diversified income or strong customer monetization are better positioned to weather economic changes (not investment advice).</p>
