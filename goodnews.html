          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract to provide artificial intelligence tools to the U.S. Defense Department for national security challenges, marking the first such contract listed on the department's website. The agreement is part of a new initiative called OpenAI for Government, offering custom AI models and support to U.S. government bodies, with all use cases adhering to OpenAI's usage policies. OpenAI is also expanding its computing power in the U.S., exemplified by the $500 billion Stargate project for AI infrastructure, and this new contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, which exceeds $10 billion in annualized sales. Microsoft, a cloud infrastructure provider for OpenAI, has also received authorization to use the Azure OpenAI service with classified information. </p>

          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom, while standing next to Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump briefly fumbled the document, blaming the wind, and mistakenly stated the agreement was with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom, and Trump indicated there were few substantial differences between this agreement and one signed in May. The agreement includes details on steel and aluminum, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff.</p>

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, founder of Sohu.com, is advising college graduates to consider starting a business instead of pursuing graduate school or immediately launching a start-up. Zhang suggested that gaining experience by working at a company first would be more beneficial. He cited his own experience, noting that his postgraduate degree did not significantly contribute to his success in establishing and running his company. Zhang, who obtained a PhD in physics from MIT, founded Internet Technologies China, which later became Sohu.com, the first mainland internet company to raise venture capital funding.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's proposed changes to the House-passed version of President Trump's tax bill could lead to a collision course between the two chambers. Key sticking points include the state and local taxes cap, with the Senate proposing to keep it at $10,000 a year while the House offers deductions up to $40,000 per year. The Senate version also permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts and includes no tax on tips and overtime, while the House's version has no explicit cap on tips and overtime deductions. The Senate package includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit, higher than the House‚Äôs $4 trillion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Arizona Humane Society (AHS) rescued a pit bull terrier named Rainbow Brite, who was found painted with multi-colored spots to resemble a leopard, along with her nine puppies. The animals were discovered tethered to a leash outdoors in 99-degree weather. The owner surrendered the 5-year-old dog and her puppies to the shelter, stating they could no longer care for them. Rainbow Brite and her litter were taken to the Lazin Animal Foundation Trauma Hospital, where Rainbow Brite's temperature was found to be dangerously high, and she was underweight. The family of ten will soon be available for adoption after being placed with a foster family.</p>

          <p>China is using its dominance in rare earth elements as leverage in its trade negotiations with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in modern technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles, medical equipment, and military applications.

This marks a change from trade talks in 2018, when Beijing's attempts at moral persuasion failed to impress then-President Trump.</p>

Maintenance and staffing challenges kept several campgrounds closed each year beginning in 2020, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reservations for Yosemite are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a camping spot at the famed park is notoriously competitive, and reservations often fill up minutes after they open. Yosemite‚Äôs reservation system was introduced in 2020 amid the pandemic and was halted earlier this year pending a review by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced that his office will investigate State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires. The California Department of Insurance has initiated a formal Market Conduct Examination of State Farm, with particular concern over how State Farm and other insurers have been handling smoke damage claims. The investigation comes a month after the insurance department approved a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers following the LA fires. Lara clarified that even if his office finds that State Farm has not properly paid out claims, state law does not allow his office to use those findings to prevent the State Farm rate increase.</p>

The mayor cited reduced crime as part of why she reduced the curfew hours, and the LAPD has arrested 575 people in total since protests began.</p>

The holiday, which commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, was declared a national holiday just four years ago, coinciding with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. However, many of these initiatives have been banned or rolled back under President Trump, leading NPR to explore the holiday's meaning in this context.</p>
