          <p>The 2025 Tour de France is set to begin on July 5 in Lille, covering a total of 3,339 kilometers with significant elevation gain across six mountain stages. Defending champion Tadej Pogacar is the top favorite, facing strong competition from previous winners Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel. Other riders to watch include Eritrean sprinter Biniam Girmay and Dutch classics specialist Mathieu van der Poel. The article also addresses ongoing concerns regarding rider safety at high speeds and the persistent issue of doping in professional cycling, despite fewer recent cases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted a new safety crackdown on power banks, which went into effect on June 28. The rule prohibits any power bank that lacks the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (CCC) mark from being brought onto aircraft. This "3C certification" is a required safety and quality standard for many products sold and used within the country. To manage the transition, Chinese airports will set up designated areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail their non-compliant devices, ensuring travelers are aware of the new regulations before flying.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 06:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing has fallen after a recent surge, with the yield on 10-year bonds decreasing. The market stabilization followed Prime Minister Keir Starmer's expression of support for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who had become emotional in Parliament after a major U-turn on welfare reform created a ¬£5 billion budget deficit. Analysts believe the market's positive reaction reflects a fear that losing Reeves could lead to weaker fiscal discipline. The movement in bond yields is significant as it can influence the cost of new mortgage deals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant decision, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court has ruled that a 175-year-old statute from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. The ruling effectively preserves legal access to abortion services throughout the state. This decision resolves a key legal question that arose following the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, which had created uncertainty about the enforceability of the pre-Civil War era law. The judgment provides clarity and ensures that abortion remains legal in Wisconsin for the time being.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively seeking to refresh its attacking lineup this summer, with a focus on signing a new center-forward and creative midfielders. The club has reportedly explored deals for strikers like Benjamin Sesko of RB Leipzig and Viktor Gyokeres of Sporting Lisbon, with the latter gaining backing from new sporting director Andrea Berta. In addition to a striker, Arsenal is also targeting wingers and attacking midfielders, with players like Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze on their list. The club's spending on these positions may necessitate selling an established first-team player.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmental advocates is proposing a plan to restore a portion of Tulare Lake in California's San Joaquin Valley. The lake, drained by farmers a century ago, reappeared during major floods in 2023. The new proposal involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a reservoir and wetlands, which would provide flood protection, water storage, and vital wildlife habitat. For the Tachi Yokut Tribe, reviving the lake, which they call Pa‚Äôashi, holds deep cultural and spiritual significance.</p>

          <p>A new subgenre of music, "toddler techno," is driving a trend of "baby raves," daytime dance parties for children and their parents. Australian entertainer Lenny Pearce, who remixes classic children's songs with heavy bass and techno beats, recently hosted sold-out shows at The Roxy in Los Angeles. The events cater to millennial parents who grew up with rave culture, offering a family-friendly version with glow sticks, face-painting, and post-nap showtimes. While some question the association with rave culture, experts note the potential benefits for parent-child bonding and sensory development.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his wavering faith in the American road trip, an experience he feels has been diminished by digital detachment, corporate sameness, and political cynicism. He describes a cross-country drive where the journey felt more like insulated sightseeing than genuine discovery. However, his belief is temporarily restored by an unexpectedly profound stay at a small, immigrant-owned motel in Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July. The warmth of the hosts and the diverse gathering of guests reminded him of the road's potential for connection and shared humanity.</p>

          <p>Gary Shteyngart's latest novel, "Vera, or Faith," is reviewed as a potent and witty story told from the perspective of a precocious 10-year-old girl in a near-future, dysfunctional America. The protagonist, Vera, navigates her parents' crumbling marriage and a society on the brink of democratic decline, where a "five-thirds" voting rights amendment for "exceptional Americans" is being considered. The review praises Shteyngart's ability to use a child's viewpoint to expose adult emotional deficiencies and the brutal simplicity of a world where children bear the consequences of others' decisions.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the policy platform of Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, arguing that his proposals are less radical than critics claim. Policies such as a rent freeze, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses have been implemented with promising results in other cities and even in New York itself. The piece suggests that Mamdani's agenda is not about reckless experimentation but about using tested ideas to make government work better for its citizens. His success in the primary indicates a public desire for a government that is more present and effective in improving daily life.</p>
