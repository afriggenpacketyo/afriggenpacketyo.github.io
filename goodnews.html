The "Nakamal agreement" is seen as part of Australia's broader strategy to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific region. While full details were not disclosed, the deal is reported to include funding for data centers, climate change adaptation, and security enhancements for Vanuatu. Leaders from both countries hailed the pact as a "win-win" that deepens their relationship, describing their nations as "family" with a "shared destiny."</p>

Executives noted strong demand related to artificial intelligence, with AI infrastructure orders from web companies reaching $800 million in the quarter and over $2 billion for the fiscal year.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 20:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Viral images of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like facial growths have sparked alarm online, but wildlife officials have a scientific explanation. The animals are infected with Shope Papilloma Virus, a disease common in the Midwest that causes keratinous tumors to grow on the rabbits' bodies. The virus is spread by ticks and fleas and is not transmissible to humans or other pets. While the growths are usually harmless to the rabbits unless they impede eating, the phenomenon is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," a fabled rabbit with antelope antlers.</p>

          <p>Following their $8-billion takeover, Skydance Media's David Ellison and his new leadership team at Paramount have unveiled their plan to restore the historic studio. The strategy involves nearly doubling the annual film output to 15-20 movies, focusing on key franchises like "Top Gun" and "Star Trek," and attracting top filmmakers for original projects. Ellison emphasized a goal of moving the company away from political divisions to create entertainment for a broad audience. The new ownership, backed by RedBird Capital, plans to be based in Hollywood and manage for long-term growth rather than short-term earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, experienced record flooding after an "outburst flood" from the glacier-dammed Suicide Basin, but managed to avoid widespread disaster as waters began to recede. The Mendenhall River crested at a new record of 16.65 feet, but temporary "Hesco" barriers installed along the riverbank successfully protected most of the nearly 1,000 structures in the flood zone. These annual floods, a consequence of a retreating glacier due to climate change, have become a recurring threat to the community. While the immediate danger has passed, the event highlights the ongoing challenges of adapting to a rapidly changing climate in the region.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure, is a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers admitting they have had loved ones join them on work trips. The trend is even more common among C-suite executives, at 73%. Motivations include saving money on personal travel and reclaiming family time that would otherwise be lost to work obligations. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a "policy grey zone," carefully separating expenses and being discreet about their companions to maintain a professional image. The global bleisure market is projected to grow substantially in the coming years.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered that the assets of Infowars, the company of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, be turned over to a court-appointed receiver for liquidation. The proceeds will go toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment won by the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. The order paves the way for the seizure of all company property, including cash, equipment, and the Infowars brand name itself, potentially ending Jones's long run. The families' lawyers praised the decision as a step toward accountability for Jones's cruel harassment and false claims that the 2012 massacre was a hoax.</p>

Babuschkin, a former engineer at Google's DeepMind and OpenAI, played a key role in building xAI's engineering teams and developing its Grok chatbot. In a post on X, he stated his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures, will focus on supporting AI safety research and investing in startups that "advance humanity." Musk thanked Babuschkin for his foundational contributions to the company, which has faced scrutiny over instances of its Grok chatbot generating false and harmful content.</p>

          <p>A large study in Sweden suggests that drug treatments for ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) may offer wider life benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that individuals taking ADHD medication had reduced first-time instances of suicidal behavior, substance misuse, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These issues are often linked to impulsivity and distraction, common symptoms of the disorder. Researchers believe the findings provide crucial evidence on the risks of not treating ADHD and could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about starting medication.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. curbs on China's shipbuilding industry, South Korean firms are boosting their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Companies such as HD Hyundai are looking to leverage lower labor costs and expand capacity outside of Korea, where they face constraints. HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million to revive a bankrupt shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts see this strategic shift as a way for Korean shipbuilders to enhance their competitive edge against their Chinese rivals, though it will take time to develop the necessary skilled labor.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur showed signs of a new tactical identity under manager Thomas Frank despite a heartbreaking loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup. Spurs led 2-0 with only five minutes remaining, largely through an efficient, pragmatic approach and a clear focus on set-pieces, from which both their goals came. However, a late comeback from the European champions forced a penalty shootout, which PSG won, denying Tottenham the trophy. While the late collapse was concerning, the performance for the first 85 minutes suggested Frank's disciplined, flexible system could provide a strong foundation for the upcoming season.</p>
