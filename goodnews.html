        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed that his tariff policies have spurred nearly $9 trillion in investments into the United States, surpassing any previous administration's achievements. However, a fact-check by CBS News reveals that these claims are not supported by concrete evidence. While companies have announced significant planned investments, the White House has not provided comprehensive data to substantiate the $9 trillion figure. Additionally, some investments cited by the administration were announced before Trump's reelection, and the comparison to the Biden administration is based on differing metrics, as future investment pledges are contrasted with completed projects from Biden's term.</p>

          <p>As cardinals gather at the Vatican to elect the next Pope, the legacy of Pope Francis looms large, with debates ongoing about whether to build on his work or steer the Catholic Church in a different direction. Pope Francis appointed approximately 80% of the cardinals participating in the conclave and sought to shift the Church's focus towards the poor and marginalized. The conclave is the most diverse in history, representing countries like South Sudan and Rwanda for the first time, which has highlighted differing needs of the Church across the globe. The new Pope will inherit a role requiring both spiritual leadership and statesmanship, navigating complex issues within the Church and on the global stage.</p>

During Khan's red carpet interview, Vogue's livestream hosts appeared unaware of his global fame, while Dosanjh's red carpet moment was cut short, leading to criticism online. A Vogue representative stated that the quick pan away from Dosanjh was unintentional, with the publication being thrilled to include Khan's clip.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, who owns a minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, has given a positive assessment of the team's rookie quarterback Cam Miller. Brady, who has a close relationship with Raiders general manager John Spytek, reportedly liked Miller's throwing technique and his potential to improve. Miller, who won two FCS national championships at North Dakota State, will join a quarterback room that includes Geno Smith and Aidan O'Connell. Smith, acquired in a trade with the Seahawks, is expected to be the starter for the upcoming season. The Raiders also signed defensive end Maxx Crosby to a record-breaking contract extension.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat reviews the Apple TV show "Your Friends & Neighbors," which stars Jon Hamm as a New York City moneyman who resorts to theft after losing his job. The show distinguishes itself by eliminating aspirational elements from its portrayal of hyperaffluence in Connecticut. Instead, the characters are depicted as unhappy, insecure, and lacking the compensations typically associated with wealth. Douthat argues that the show serves as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by portraying the rich world as a place where unhappiness is magnified and financial security remains an illusion.</p>
