          <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced he has spoken with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia, stating both nations are seeking an immediate ceasefire after days of deadly border clashes. Trump indicated that peace talks were a natural path forward and linked future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. The conflict, which has resulted in at least 33 deaths and displaced over 130,000 people, stems from a long-standing border dispute centered on the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. Officials from the two countries have not yet confirmed the talks mentioned by Trump.</p>

          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the acclaimed 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, over two decades after the original's release. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape of women's football made it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup, and hopes to reunite the original cast. The original film was a cultural hit, praised for inspiring a generation of female athletes.</p>

          <h2>New Wearable Sensor Aims to Prevent Dehydration and Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor designed to monitor a person's hydration levels in real time. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the arm to measure tissue hydration, and wirelessly transmits the data to a smartphone to alert users when they need water. Scientists say this technology could be a crucial tool in preventing dehydration-related health issues like heatstroke, particularly for athletes, outdoor workers, and individuals with certain medical conditions. The team hopes to make the technology widely accessible for public use.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance on the fourth day of the fourth Test against England, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early setback losing two wickets for no runs, captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) and KL Rahul (87 not out) forged an unbroken partnership of 174. Their performance blunted an England attack that was missing all-rounder Ben Stokes, who did not bowl. Earlier, Stokes had scored his 14th Test century, a knock of 141, to help England post a formidable total of 669, giving them a first-innings lead of 311.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached new record highs this past week, buoyed by positive developments in international trade and strong corporate earnings. The market's upward momentum was partly fueled by President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China and the EU. Economically, reports on home sales showed mixed price trends, a key factor for inflation. Major companies like GE Vernova and Danaher reported strong quarterly results, though Honeywell and Dover saw their stocks dip despite beating expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While recent studies link daily coffee consumption to health benefits, experts emphasize that the right amount varies for each individual and that moderation is crucial. The FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups, but some people may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Dietitians advise being mindful of how your body reacts, noting that caffeine can affect sleep and suppress appetite. For most healthy adults, two to three cups before noon is considered a safe range, but pregnant people and those with certain health conditions should be more cautious.</p>

The discussions follow a recent meeting between the US and Chinese foreign ministers, which was described as a positive and essential step toward a potential leader-level summit.</p>
