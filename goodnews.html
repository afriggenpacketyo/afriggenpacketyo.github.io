          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' shares climbed by approximately 5% following the announcement of a limited-edition collaboration with football star Travis Kelce. This strategic partnership, which was over a year in development, capitalized on the immense public interest generated by Kelce's recent engagement to Taylor Swift, which also briefly impacted other related stocks. The "AE x TK" collection introduces vintage-inspired T-shirts and reimagined varsity jackets, blending the brand's style with Kelce's picks. This move highlights the company's approach to leveraging celebrity endorsements to drive market engagement and sales, building on past high-profile campaigns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer reported better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue, even as its overall sales declined. The company also tightened its full-year sales guidance, indicating a more optimistic outlook, and revised its adjusted earnings per share forecast upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged economic pressures on lower and middle-income customers but highlighted ongoing initiatives to revitalize the brand, such as reintroducing petite sections, bringing back jewelry, and refining discount strategies. Despite recent leadership changes and past struggles, these financial results suggest the company is making tangible progress in its efforts to return to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are implementing diverse strategies to counteract the effects of new tariffs, tailored to their specific product categories and customer demographics. Abercrombie & Fitch has significantly diversified its global supply chain to lessen its tariff burden, while Best Buy engaged in front-loading shipments earlier in the year. Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, benefits from its flexible inventory model, allowing for opportunistic purchasing. Industry experts predict tariffs will become a more significant headwind in the second half of the year, with larger, food-centric retailers better equipped to absorb costs than those focused on general merchandise.

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only by her surname Zhou, was dramatically rescued after enduring 30 hours trapped in a locked guesthouse room in western China's Sichuan province. Without her phone and facing a malfunctioning lock that prevented escape, Zhou, in a desperate act, bit her finger and used her blood to scrawl "110 625" on a pillow. She then threw the makeshift distress signal from her sixth-floor window, where it was spotted by a quick-thinking food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, who promptly contacted emergency services. Police arrived to free a disheveled but grateful Zhou, and Zhang was later awarded 3,000 yuan for his crucial role in the rescue.</p>

          <p>China has substantially increased its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) funding, committing $124 billion in investments and construction contracts during the first six months of 2025, already exceeding the total for the previous year. This accelerated funding highlights a strategic reorientation, with a pronounced focus on Central Asia. Kazakhstan notably became the largest destination for Chinese capital, attracting $23 billion, including a significant $12 billion aluminum complex. Concurrently, funding for BRI projects in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East has reportedly decreased, reflecting a dynamic adjustment to internal economic pressures and shifting global trade landscapes.</p>

          <p>A pivotal federal court ruling is anticipated regarding Google's highly lucrative default search contracts, which generate over $26 billion annually, with a substantial $20 billion directed to Apple. Following a prior ruling that Google held a search monopoly, the judge is now considering remedies that could potentially prohibit exclusive agreements. While Apple faces a significant financial risk, some analysts suggest Google could ultimately benefit by redirecting funds from these costly deals towards strategic investments in AI and cloud technologies. This case is poised to redefine competition in the tech industry, particularly as generative AI rapidly transforms the future of search capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark has issued an official apology for its long-standing forced contraception campaign targeting Inuit women in Greenland, which spanned from the 1960s to 1992. Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen conveyed Denmark's regret for the systematic discrimination, acknowledging that over 4,500 Inuit women, many of them teenagers, were compelled to wear intrauterine devices (IUDs) without their consent, leading to sterility and profound physical and psychological issues. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also offered an apology, as about 150 affected women are currently pursuing legal action against Denmark for compensation. This apology precedes an anticipated report on the mistreatment, seeking to address a deeply troubling historical injustice.</p>

Although military service remains voluntary, the legislation introduces a mandatory questionnaire for 18-year-old men, with medical examinations becoming compulsory for them from July 2027. The comprehensive package includes improved salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and rail travel to attract volunteers. While some conservatives express doubts about achieving recruitment goals without reintroducing conscription, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasizes the voluntary scheme as a crucial step forward, acknowledging current logistical constraints for universal service.</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington, D.C., crime data reveals a nearly 50% decrease in violent crime during the three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement, compared to the same period last year. The data also shows significant drops in burglaries and car thefts. Although crime rates were already on a downward trend, the analysis indicates that federal deployments were strategically concentrated in areas with historically higher crime rates. The White House reported over 1,094 arrests and 115 firearms seized, but local leaders, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have raised concerns about the extensive National Guard presence, citing potential community fear and disruption.</p>

This reversal followed significant public backlash on social media and direct criticism from President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to reinstate its traditional branding. The proposed new logo, which eliminated the familiar "Uncle Herschel" character and the "Old Country Store" phrase, was widely perceived as "generic" and sparked accusations of the brand going "woke" from conservative critics. Cracker Barrel expressed gratitude for customer feedback, reaffirming its dedication to its established values and country hospitality.</p>

While its English-dubbed re-release in the US had limited success, an earlier subtitled version performed strongly, indicating an audience for the original. The article attributes this triumph to the film being an epic sequel featuring maximalist, visually stunning animation and a universally relatable coming-of-age narrative.
