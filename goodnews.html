          <p>Costco reported strong fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue, surpassing analysts' estimates with an 8% sales increase. Net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, driven by comparable sales growth of 8% and a nearly 16% increase in e-commerce sales. The company's competitive pricing and bulk discounts, coupled with discounted gas and groceries, are expected to continue driving customer traffic and membership renewals, especially in an uncertain economic environment. However, potential tariffs could add expenses for Costco, potentially leading to higher prices for shoppers. The article notes that Costco's CEO stated that customers rely on Costco more in a challenging economy. The company's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 this year.</p>

          <p>Gap Inc. reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings, but its shares plummeted due to concerns about the potential impact of new tariffs, which could cost the company between $100 million and $150 million. While the company is working to mitigate these costs by diversifying its supply chain, the tariffs are throwing a wrench into CEO Richard Dickson's turnaround plans. The company reported earnings per share of 51 cents versus 45 cents expected, and revenue of $3.46 billion versus $3.42 billion expected, with Old Navy and Gap brands showing strong performance, while Banana Republic continues to struggle. The article states that Gap expects full-year sales to grow between 1% and 2%, in line with expectations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, offers borrowers the possibility of having a portion of their credit card debt forgiven, typically ranging from 30% to 50%. This can occur through a negotiated debt settlement process, bankruptcy, or debt management programs. To qualify, borrowers generally need a credit card debt balance between $5,000 and $10,000, be behind on payments, and demonstrate financial hardship. It's crucial to understand the nuances of each service and shop around for debt relief companies to determine the most suitable option for individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stocks closed higher on Thursday after initial rulings against President Trump's tariffs boosted market sentiment, although an appeals court later revived the policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw gains following the U.S. Court of International Trade's decision to block some of Trump's tariffs. However, an appeals court opted to revive the policy on administrative grounds, affording the judges additional time to weigh the case, leaving the ultimate fate of the policy uncertain. The ruling centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act as a legal justification for tariffs.</p>

The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33 and revenue between $41.0 billion and $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts attributed the post-earnings move to a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss.
