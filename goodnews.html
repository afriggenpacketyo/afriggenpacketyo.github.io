          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has advanced to the quarter-finals of the Washington Open after a decisive straight-sets victory over former world number one Naomi Osaka. This win follows her earlier upset of the seventh seed, setting her up to face Maria Sakkari next. In the men's singles tournament, however, British contenders Cameron Norrie and Dan Evans were both knocked out in the last 16. Norrie lost to American Brandon Nakashima, while Evans, the 2023 tournament champion, was defeated by Corentin Moutet of France.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting the stage for the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after 50 years in public service, Evers' decision opens a key contest in the battleground state. His tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, but also by recent bipartisan cooperation on the state budget. The announcement is expected to draw a wide field of candidates from both parties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily extended a pause on a lower court ruling that would have prevented private individuals and groups from filing lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The case originates from a challenge by two tribal nations in North Dakota over a redistricting map they argued diluted Native American voting power. An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel had ruled that only the U.S. Justice Department could bring such cases, a decision that would significantly weaken the landmark civil rights law. Voting rights advocates fear that if the Supreme Court takes up a full review, its conservative majority could formalize this restriction nationwide.</p>

          <p>Industrial manufacturer Dover reported second-quarter results that surpassed expectations, including a 5% revenue increase and record-high adjusted segment EBITDA margins. Despite this positive performance and a raised full-year outlook, the company's shares fell, a reaction the article suggests is a misjudgment by the market. The report highlights strong bookings, which indicate future growth momentum, and strategic investments in high-growth areas like data center cooling and biopharma. The analysis concludes the sell-off presents a buying opportunity for the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England established a dominant position on the second day of the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from Ben Stokes and a rapid opening partnership. Stokes' performance, his first five-for in eight years, helped restrict India to a total of 358. Openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett then launched an aggressive assault, scoring 166 runs at over five an over before both falling short of centuries. India's innings was notable for the courageous return of Rishabh Pant, who batted despite a suspected broken foot to score a half-century.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts has made it clear he is not dwelling on last season's Super Bowl victory, stating he has "moved on" to the new season. Despite being named Super Bowl MVP just five months ago, Hurts emphasized a forward-looking mindset, telling reporters the past is behind them and the focus is on the present. He admitted to appreciating the championship ring when it was presented but said he has not worn it since. This sentiment is shared by his teammates and coach, who are stressing the need to prove themselves all over again rather than defending a past title.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is growing significantly, with AI-related job postings increasing at an average annual rate of 29% over the last 15 years. A recent report from the Brookings Institution shows that as more companies integrate AI into their operations, they are actively seeking employees for both advanced roles like AI engineers and general positions that require AI proficiency. These jobs, which are concentrated in tech hubs but are diffusing nationwide, also tend to offer higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI requirement.</p>

          <p>For savers deciding where to place a significant sum like $25,000, the choice between a 6-month CD and a high-yield savings account involves a trade-off between guaranteed rates and liquidity. Based on current rates, a CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more over six months than a savings account at 4.30%, with the added benefit of locking in that rate. The article advises that the decision should be based on individual financial needs; those requiring emergency access to funds may prefer a high-yield savings account, while those who can commit the funds for the full term can secure a better, guaranteed return with a CD.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to phase out paper checks, confirming it will continue to issue them for beneficiaries who have no other way to receive payments. The agency had previously announced a switch to all-electronic deposits starting in October, citing cost savings and security. The policy change followed a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano, where concerns were raised about the roughly 600,000 Americans, many of whom are unbanked, who rely on paper checks. The SSA will continue to encourage beneficiaries to switch to electronic payments voluntarily.</p>

          <p>Erik and Karin Vonk have transformed a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most acclaimed craft distilleries, located on a 70-acre estate south of Atlanta. Uniquely, they are among the few distillers worldwide who grow their own sugarcane and use its fresh juice rather than molasses, a practice Erik learned from his grandfather. This distinction has helped their rum gain critical acclaim amid a nationwide "rum renaissance." The business has thrived following a 2017 change in Georgia law that allowed distilleries to sell products directly to consumers, turning their passion project into a major local attraction.</p>

Notably absent are the major AI-powered Siri updates promised in 2024, which are not expected until at least 2026, though some smaller AI features like real-time translation have been included.</p>

Hampshire Constabulary released body-worn camera footage of the incident, in which officers thanked the actor for his help. The 29-year-old suspect later admitted to five separate incidents of theft and is awaiting sentencing.</p>
