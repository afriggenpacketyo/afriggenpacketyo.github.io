          <p>OpenAI announced that its ChatGPT platform is poised to reach 700 million weekly active users, a fourfold increase year-over-year, with daily user messages surpassing three billion. This rapid expansion is supported by a recent $8.3 billion investment, part of a larger $40 billion fundraising round, as the company's annual recurring revenue hits $13 billion. The growth highlights intense competition in the AI sector, with rivals like Google and Anthropic also securing massive funding and expanding their user bases. OpenAI is heavily investing in global infrastructure, including a $500 billion Stargate joint venture, to support its continued push.</p>

          <p>Actor Josh Brolin is making his debut in the horror genre with the film "Weapons," where he portrays a father searching for his missing child. Brolin explained that he was drawn to the role as a creative challenge and an opportunity to confront themes of masculinity and vulnerability. Known for major roles in "Avengers" and "Dune," he stated he deliberately avoided horror projects while raising his children but was intrigued by the challenge of a new genre. The film, which explores a man's reaction when the thing he cares about most is taken away, is set to open in theaters soon.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, a move intended to de-escalate trade tensions and allow for further negotiations. The countermeasures were set to take effect this week in response to a U.S. trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods. This decision follows a political agreement reached between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump in late July. The EU Commission stated the goal is to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle experienced a significant surge of over 15% after President Donald Trump praised the retailer's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. Trump's social media post called it the "'HOTTEST' ad out there," which appeared to trigger a rebound in the stock after it had slumped amid some criticism of the campaign's slogan. The incident highlights the complex landscape marketers navigate, balancing potential backlash with the significant attention and market reaction that can be generated from cultural and political discourse. The company has been struggling with sales, and the campaign is a key part of its strategy to reverse the trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current uncertain retirement landscape, annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, but they are not suitable for everyone. This article suggests that near-retirees wanting to lock in currently high interest rates and risk-averse individuals prioritizing certainty over growth may benefit from purchasing an annuity now. Conversely, younger investors with long time horizons, people who may need access to their cash soon, and anyone carrying high-interest debt should likely avoid them. The high surrender charges and lack of liquidity make annuities a poor choice for those who need financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his daily market analysis, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to consider buying shares of Wells Fargo and Capital One, citing a belief that a weaker economy could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which would likely boost the market. While the firm recently trimmed its position in Wells Fargo to lock in gains, the long-term positive view remains. Cramer suggested that investors who don't already own these financial stocks could find a good entry point now. However, he advised holding off on buying Goldman Sachs, as its stock has already seen a significant run-up. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Increased Screenings in Younger Adults Linked to Rise in Early-Stage Colorectal Cancer Diagnoses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:01:21 EDT</div>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that increased screening for colorectal cancer among people aged 45 to 49 is leading to more diagnoses at an early, more treatable stage. This follows recommendations from 2018 and 2021 that lowered the suggested screening age from 50 to 45. One study showed a steep 12% annual increase in incidence for this age group from 2019 to 2022, which researchers believe is due to first-time screenings detecting existing cancers. While the findings are promising, experts caution that screening rates in this demographic remain suboptimal.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk valued at approximately $29 billion, consisting of 96 million shares of restricted stock. This grant comes six months after a Delaware judge voided his previous $56 billion package from 2018, a ruling Musk is currently appealing. The new award is structured to be forfeited if the courts ultimately reinstate the 2018 package. Analysts suggest the move is designed to ensure Musk's leadership at Tesla for the next several years and motivate him as the company navigates increasing competition and a transition towards artificial intelligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts predict that interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, as the Federal Reserve holds its benchmark rate steady amid a recent uptick in inflation. While some banks have already started to slightly lower their CD rates in anticipation of future Fed cuts, the general forecast is for continued stability in the short term. Experts note that short-term CDs currently offer more competitive rates than long-term ones, as banks are hesitant to lock in high rates for extended periods. Savers are advised to research different banks to find the best available rates. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have announced a major breakthrough, identifying the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found to infect shellfish. The epidemic has devastated more than 20 species, with the sunflower sea star population declining by about 90%. This discovery solves a decade-long mystery and provides hope for recovery efforts, as scientists can now test for the bacteria, breed healthy sea stars, and work to restore the kelp forest ecosystems that collapsed in their absence.</p>
