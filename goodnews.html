          <h2>Analysis Suggests Delta and United Airlines Are Outperforming Competitors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:03:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from other major U.S. carriers, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong networks and a focus on premium and international travel, which provides a buffer against a competitive domestic market where airfares are falling. Both airlines have pointed to robust revenue from premium cabins and loyalty programs, even as they trim overall capacity plans. This strategy allows them to maintain stronger financial performance compared to competitors focused more on price-sensitive domestic travelers. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly enacted "no tax on tips" provision is causing confusion regarding its application and who qualifies for the benefit. The measure is not a complete tax elimination but rather a deduction of up to $25,000, available from 2025 through 2028, which phases out for higher earners. Crucially, the IRS still needs to clarify which specific occupations are eligible, with guidance expected in October. Tax professionals note uncertainty also exists around how the deduction interacts with reporting requirements for cash tips and income from gig economy platforms, which have their own reporting thresholds.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:56:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's spending on hotels to house asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, falling from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. According to Home Office accounts, the savings were primarily achieved by moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. The average nightly cost per person dropped significantly due to these measures, including increased room sharing in the remaining hotels. However, an expert from the Migration Observatory warned that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase reliance on hotels again in the near future.</p>

          <p>Undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk engaged in apparent mind games with challenger Daniel Dubois during the final weigh-in for their championship rematch. Usyk, who came in at a career-heavy 16st 3lb, repeatedly stepped in front of Dubois on stage, drawing cheers from the largely pro-Usyk crowd at Wembley. The tense face-off concluded with a perturbed-looking Dubois walking off stage. The encounter sets the stage for their highly anticipated fight at Wembley Stadium, where Dubois seeks to avenge his previous stoppage loss to the undefeated Ukrainian champion.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, clearing a major hurdle after an arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil. Exxon had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's significant oil assets in the Stabroek Block off the coast of Guyana, a dispute that had cast uncertainty over the deal. With the ruling, Chevron gains a crucial 30% stake in the vast and lucrative oil development. While Exxon stated it disagrees with the interpretation, it will respect the outcome and welcome Chevron to the joint venture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key survey from the University of Michigan indicates that consumers' near-term inflation expectations have fallen significantly, returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, its lowest point since February. Overall consumer sentiment also saw a slight increase, aligning with economists' estimates. While the data suggests consumers believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary, the report notes that expectations remain above late 2024 levels, indicating lingering concern about future price increases.

          <p>A 55-year-old woman from Northamptonshire, England, discovered she had a brain tumor after a routine eye test at an optician. Elizabeth Craig had noticed declining vision in one eye, and the optician's referral led to an MRI scan that revealed a meningioma pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing for the brain tumor just four months later, doctors discovered a suspicious nodule in her breast, which was diagnosed as breast cancer. Now recovering after successful treatment for both conditions, she is raising awareness about how routine health checks can lead to lifesaving discoveries.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced they will take no further action against the Irish rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their recent Glastonbury performance. The investigation was launched over comments made on stage, which the band called an act of "political policing intimidation." After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction for any offence." The group has recently faced controversy for their pro-Palestinian stance and comments made regarding a band member's upcoming court case on an unrelated charge.</p>
