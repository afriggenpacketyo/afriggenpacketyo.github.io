        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's fast bowler Jamie Overton is sidelined for the remaining one-day internationals against the West Indies after fracturing his little finger. The injury occurred while he was attempting to catch the ball during England's recent victory at Edgbaston. Expected to be out for approximately a month, Overton will also miss the subsequent T20 matches against the West Indies. No replacement has been named for the upcoming second ODI in Cardiff, where England aims to secure the series win. The team will need to adjust their strategy in light of Overton's absence. The loss of Overton will require the team to make adjustments to their bowling lineup for the remainder of the series. The team hopes that he will have a speedy recovery.</p>

          <p>Jewish students, faculty, and alumni are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's use of antisemitism allegations to justify repressive policies. They argue that these policies do not represent their Jewish values and are being used to undermine academic freedom and suppress pro-Palestinian voices. These Jewish organizers have been writing letters, leading protests, and lobbying legislators to denounce what they view as the systematic exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel. They emphasize the need for nuanced discussions about Israel, antisemitism, and Jewish identity that respect diverse perspectives and generational differences. Many feel compelled to invoke their Jewish identity publicly for the first time to combat the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Brad G. Smith, diagnosed with ALS, can now communicate using only his thoughts thanks to a Neuralink brain implant. The device, placed in his skull and connected to the motor cortex, picks up signals from his neurons and transmits them wirelessly to a computer, which decodes the signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor and type. Smith previously relied on eye-tracking technology, which was limited by lighting conditions. Smith now uses Grok, an AI chatbot, to assist with writing responses and suggesting replies, enhancing his communication speed and capabilities. Neuralink recently received a "breakthrough" designation from the FDA, with hopes of helping people with severe speech impairments.</p>

          <p>Jessica Slice, a disabled mother diagnosed with POTS, challenges conventional parenting norms in her book, advocating for mutual aid and stronger social safety nets. She argues that parenting involves accepting a loss of control and embracing interdependence, which she learned through her experience of becoming disabled. Slice emphasizes the importance of asking for help and releasing the pressure to do everything right, both for herself and her children. She also highlights the stigma surrounding disability in a culture that values productivity and independence, suggesting that accepting fragility can lead to more joy and honesty in parenting. Slice's advocacy stems from her experiences navigating the healthcare system and societal expectations as a disabled parent.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has confirmed the presence of three new wolf packs in Northern California, bringing the state's total to ten. This resurgence of gray wolves, protected under state and federal endangered species laws, has sparked concerns among ranchers due to increased attacks on livestock. Shasta County has joined other counties in declaring a state of emergency and is seeking state assistance to address the growing wolf population. Wildlife officials are tracking the wolves and exploring methods to mitigate conflicts, including using nonlethal ammunition and reimbursing ranchers for livestock losses. Conservationists see the wolf population's growth as a positive sign for the state's native animals.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if faulty drug tests led to wrongful parole denials. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. Attorneys for the Board of Parole are assessing inmate files to identify cases where a new hearing may be warranted. Representatives at UnCommon Law, a nonprofit advocacy group, indicated that the review involves at least 459 parole hearings and dozens of administrative reviews. The faulty tests were identified by the California Correctional Health Care Services after noticing a spike in positive opiate drug screenings.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks and a ¬£2 billion upgrade, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales has fully reopened. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's economic benefits, opponents criticize its lengthy duration and high cost. The project's completion marks the end of significant roadworks for drivers traveling between Swansea and Monmouthshire.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes provide a supportive environment for individuals with dementia and their caregivers, offering camaraderie and social interaction. These gatherings, often inexpensive to run, offer a valuable resource for those facing social isolation and stress following a dementia diagnosis. The cafes distinguish themselves from other programs by including caregivers, recognizing their need for support as well. As cases of memory loss rise and federal health funding faces potential cuts, memory cafes may become an increasingly important part of the care continuum. The social support and recreational activities help ease the stress and improve the quality of life for both patients and their families.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will allocate 3% of its GDP to defence by 2034. This commitment is expected to be a key component of the government's forthcoming strategic defence review. The review will likely emphasize the increasing threats posed by drones and artificial intelligence. The review is expected to warn of "a new era of threat" with drones and artificial intelligence changing the nature of the dangers Britain faces. In addition, the government plans to invest over ¬£1.5 billion to improve military housing conditions.</p>

          <h2>India Details Tactical Changes in Conflict with Pakistan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 04:44:19 EDT</div>

          <p>India's chief of defence staff, General Anil Chauhan, revealed that India adjusted its tactics after initial air losses in the conflict with Pakistan earlier this month. Following the changes, India established a decisive advantage before a ceasefire was declared. The conflict was sparked by an attack in Indian Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan-backed terrorists. Chauhan stated that India rectified tactics and then went back on the 7th, 8th and 10th in large numbers to hit air bases deep inside Pakistan, penetrated all their air defences with impunity, carried out precision strikes. Both sides have maintained that there was no danger of nuclear weapons being considered during the conflict.</p>
