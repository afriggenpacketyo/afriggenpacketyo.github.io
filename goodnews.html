          <h2>Japan's Elderly Without Children Direct Their Wealth to Charitable Causes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Japan's population ages, an increasing number of elderly individuals without children are choosing to donate their assets to charitable organizations after their death. This trend is fueled by the rise in childless couples and unmarried individuals who lack direct heirs. Bequest donations are facilitated by organizations like Readyfor Inc., which connect donors with recipients, such as medical facilities and universities. Yoko Inaba, a 71-year-old, has arranged for her money to be donated to a medical facility for newborns, driven by a personal connection to infant medical treatment. This shift reflects a growing awareness of bequest donations among those without heirs, leading to a rise in planned giving to support various causes.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for top investors in his $TRUMP cryptocurrency, promising to support the crypto industry from the White House. The event drew protesters who condemned it as corruption, while attendees expressed intentions to influence U.S. financial regulations. Trump criticized the Biden administration's enforcement actions against crypto companies and pledged a more favorable approach. The dinner, organized by Trump's business partners, was seen as a means to enrich the Trump family through the memecoin, which generates fees each time the coins change hands.

          <p>The finance chiefs of the Group of Seven (G7) nations emphasized their unity in addressing global economic challenges and supporting Ukraine, despite ongoing trade tensions stemming from U.S. tariffs.

While avoiding direct mention of Trump's tariff regime, they acknowledged concerns about the potential economic uncertainty resulting from the measures. The group reaffirmed its commitment to supporting Ukraine in its conflict with Russia and discussed China's industrial overcapacity and nonmarket practices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, the highest in over two years, driven by reduced energy subsidies and rising rice prices. The core inflation figure, which excludes fresh food prices, surpassed expectations and marked the highest level since January 2023. Headline inflation remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. Rising rice prices have contributed significantly to the increase, with the Prime Minister pledging to lower prices. The Bank of Japan is monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs while considering future rate adjustments.</p>

He noted the difference between Musk in 'businessman mode' and 'political operative mode.' Tesla designs, builds, and sells electric vehicles and energy products, offering related services to a wide range of customers.
