          <p>A parent shares their perspective on why they support their 17-year-old son's decision to pursue flight school instead of a traditional four-year university. The article argues that given the rising cost of tuition and the burden of student loan debt, college is no longer a guaranteed path to success for everyone. The author notes that for their son, who is passionate and focused on becoming an airline pilot, a specialized vocational path is a more direct and financially sensible choice. This personal viewpoint reflects a broader American sentiment questioning the universal value and cost-effectiveness of a college degree.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential problem with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding sufficient pressure during deployment in certain crashes. The automaker's parent company, Stellantis, stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the faulty airbags free of charge, and owners are urged to follow the instructions on their recall notices.</p>

England's chase faltered early, and despite resistance from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, they were bowled out for 113.

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people marched in the Budapest Pride parade, defying a government ban in what organizers called the largest LGBTQ+ event in Hungary's history. The march was outlawed under a controversial law passed by Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's party, which prohibits events deemed to "promote" homosexuality to minors. However, Budapest's mayor declared the parade a municipal event to bypass the restriction, despite threats of fines and potential prison sentences for organizers. The large turnout, which included EU officials, was seen as a significant rebuke of Orb√°n's policies and a defense of democratic rights.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive victory over the Western Force, but the win was tempered by an injury to a key player. Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a hamstring injury, raising concerns about depth at the position for the rest of the tour. Head coach Andy Farrell praised the team's attacking style but noted a high penalty count in the first half that needs to be addressed. The performance of lock Joe McCarthy was a standout, bolstering his case for a spot in the upcoming Test series.</p>
