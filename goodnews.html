          <p>Apple is reportedly planning to release a folding iPhone as early as next year, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The device is expected to feature a display manufactured by Samsung Display, which is preparing to produce millions of foldable panels for Apple. While other components, such as the hinge, are still being finalized, Kuo anticipates that the folding iPhone will be priced as a premium product. Apple's iPhone remains a significant revenue source for the company, and the company is continuously exploring new avenues to attract customers and encourage upgrades to more expensive devices.</p>

          <p>Karen Read has been found not guilty of second-degree murder but guilty of drunk driving in the death of John O'Keefe. The retrial took place in the same courtroom with the same judge, but with a different atmosphere due to the mishandling of the case by law enforcement in the initial investigation. Special prosecutor Hank Brennan had the advantage of knowing the defense's arguments in advance, but had to overcome the shadow of the fired state trooper Michael Proctor, whose conduct was heavily criticized. The defense focused on inconsistencies in witness testimonies and suggested an alternative suspect from the close-knit Canton community.</p>

Classic navy walls are also highly sought after in bedrooms, while dark gray is preferred for living rooms.

Making minimum payments on an $8,000 balance with a 22% APR could take over 30 years and cost nearly $40,000 in interest. Debt consolidation loans, balance transfers, debt management plans, and debt settlement are options that can expedite the process and reduce interest payments.
