          <p>Jim Cramer's Monday playbook analyzes the stock market's robust rally, which was significantly boosted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for upcoming interest rate cuts. Powell's pivot was largely driven by a surprising deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs. Cramer identifies strong investment opportunities in housing, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, while advising caution regarding enterprise software and certain healthcare sectors. The article also discusses the nuanced performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks and the persistent influence of political dynamics on economic policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Palmer Luckey, founder of the defense technology company Anduril, passionately advocates for AI-powered autonomous weapons as the inevitable future of warfare, envisioning the U.S. as the "world gun store." He asserts that advanced autonomous systems, such as Anduril's Roadrunner drone interceptor and Dive XL submarine, offer superior artificial intelligence and operational autonomy compared to existing military technology, thereby significantly reducing risks to American service members. While acknowledging ethical concerns about "killer robots," Luckey maintains that all Anduril products incorporate a "kill switch" for human intervention and ultimately promote peace through credible deterrence. Anduril aims to disrupt traditional defense procurement by developing working prototypes with private capital before seeking government contracts, ensuring efficiency and innovation.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France has been associated with over 70 recognized medical miracles by the Catholic Church in 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts rigorous, decade-long investigations into claimed cures, seeking sudden, complete, lasting recoveries with no medical explanation. Dr. Esther Sternberg's analysis affirmed the credibility of their conclusions, despite historical skepticism. Four living individuals whose recoveries from severe conditions like osteosarcoma and paralysis were recognized as miracles attest to their continued good health.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident for charging a visiting family member's Tesla in their driveway, not due to the vehicle itself, but because the extension cord was deemed "ugly." The HOA's letter cited a rule against "electrical chords running along the ground," referencing NEC 625, but many online respondents argued the board was overreaching. Experts noted that standard Level 1 charging, as described, typically doesn't violate electrical codes. The incident highlights HOAs' reputation for micromanaging aesthetics, even when safety regulations are not genuinely at issue.</p>
