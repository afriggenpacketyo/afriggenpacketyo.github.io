          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company hasn't observed any decrease in consumer demand despite President Trump's tariffs. Jassy noted that they haven't seen significant average selling price increases either. This statement was made during Amazon's annual shareholder meeting. While Amazon continues to assess the tariff impacts, Walmart has cautioned that consumers may experience price increases later in May and June.

The test is for individuals 55 and older with existing memory problems and cognitive symptoms. It aims to provide quicker and more accurate diagnoses, with the potential to reach over 90% accuracy, compared to current methods. The blood test could lead to earlier diagnoses, allowing more people to be eligible for amyloid-reducing drugs.

          <p>Target's sluggish first quarter was partly attributed to consumer protests over the company's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. CEO Brian Cornell cited consumer reaction to "updates" on belonging as a headwind. This reaction compounded ongoing pressure on consumer spending amid declining consumer confidence and tariff uncertainty. In January, Target scaled back its "Belonging at the Bullseye" strategy, which focused on hiring and supplier diversity goals. While Walmart's sales jumped, foot traffic at Costco, which supports DEI policies, increased, contrasting with the decline at Target.</p>
