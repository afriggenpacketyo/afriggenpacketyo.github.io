          <p>The price of gold has surged to a record high of $4,000 an ounce due to investors seeking safe-haven assets amid global economic and political uncertainties. The rally has been fueled by concerns over trade tensions initiated by US tariffs and delays in economic data reporting caused by the US government shutdown. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe investment during market turbulence, attracting both retail and institutional investors. However, analysts caution that gold prices could decline if interest rates rise or geopolitical tensions ease, as seen in previous instances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a short-term solution to keep the WIC nutrition program running during the government shutdown. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that President Trump authorized the use of Section 232 tariff revenue to sustain the program, ensuring that low-income mothers and children continue to receive assistance. This decision comes after Leavitt accused Democrats of forcing WIC to run out of funds due to their actions during the shutdown. The White House has not disclosed the amount of tariff money being used, but the infusion is expected to cover costs for the foreseeable future. </p>

          <p>Matt Van Epps, backed by President Trump, has won the Republican primary in a special election for a Tennessee House seat. He will now face Democratic state Representative Aftyn Behn in December. Van Epps secured the victory after receiving an endorsement from President Trump, which came after in-person early voting had already ended. The seat became vacant when former Representative Mark Green resigned, and the general election in December could indicate the popularity of President Trump's agenda. </p>

While Democratic candidates generally support the plan, some acknowledge unease, while Republican and Green Party candidates criticize it as corrupt and unconstitutional. Candidates also discussed their messages to California voters who supported Donald Trump in 2020, whose political representation could be affected by the redistricting.</p>

The rule would allocate half of all savings made by a future Conservative government to deficit reduction, while the other half would be used for policies that promote economic growth, including tax cuts. Badenoch accuses the Labour government of risking the UK's financial stability through excessive borrowing and taxation. The Conservatives plan to save £47bn a year through cuts to welfare, the civil service, and foreign aid. (not investment advice)</p>
