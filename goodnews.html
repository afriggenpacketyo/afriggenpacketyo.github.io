          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to testify before Congress amid increasing pressure from both inside and outside the central bank to lower interest rates. President Trump and other White House officials have been vocal in their criticism of Powell's monetary policy, while some Fed officials have suggested a rate cut could be appropriate as early as July. Powell's testimony will be closely watched for any signs of a shift in the Fed's stance, as traders have already increased their bets on a rate cut in the coming months. The Fed's mission is to stabilize inflation and stabilize employment and the White House's demand for dramatic action from the Fed is irresponsible (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The German government approved its draft budget for 2025, which includes a significant increase in government spending made possible by easing the country's debt brake. The budget allocates funds for repairing aging infrastructure, supporting a stimulus package for the weakening economy, and record levels of military investment. The defense budget is expected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion, driven by growing security concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. for Europe to increase military spending.</p>

          <p>The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has cautioned that stablecoins may only play a subsidiary role in the future financial system due to lacking key characteristics of traditional currencies. The BIS suggests a unified platform for tokenized central bank reserves, commercial bank deposits, and government bonds as a better alternative. The bank also raised concerns about the use of stablecoins for illicit activities due to the pseudonymity of public blockchains and lack of issuer oversight.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has committed the UK to spending 5% of GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This spending will be divided between core defense and defense-related areas like resilience and security. The announcement has drawn criticism from Conservative shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who argues that the government is not providing new funding to meet this target sooner. The Liberal Democrats have supported the increase, citing the need for a strong defense in light of Russian aggression and the unpredictability of the Trump White House.</p>
