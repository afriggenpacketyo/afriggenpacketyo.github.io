          <p>Manchester United is undergoing a rebuilding phase, marked by a recent defeat to the ASEAN All-Stars in Malaysia, which led to the team being booed off the pitch. Despite this setback, veteran goalkeeper Tom Heaton is expected to sign a one-year contract extension. The club is also pursuing Ipswich striker Liam Delap, facing competition from Chelsea, with a decision expected before the European Under-21 Championships. Chief executive Omar Berrada emphasized the club's clear plan for squad investment, while manager Amorim hopes for a transformation in Rasmus Hojlund's form. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tokyo University of Agriculture reveals that cats use their sense of smell to distinguish their owners from strangers. Researchers analyzed cats' behavior when presented with scent samples from their owners and unfamiliar humans. The cats spent more time smelling samples from strangers and favored their right nostrils, suggesting a different processing of familiar and novel scents. Personality traits also influenced behavior, with more "neurotic" male cats returning to scent tubes repeatedly, while more "agreeable" cats rarely did so, adding another layer to understanding feline-human interactions.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise recent college graduates to start saving for retirement as soon as possible to leverage the benefits of compound interest and long-term market participation. Setting up a routine of investing at a young age, even with small amounts, can lead to significant long-term financial stability. Investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes can provide diversification. While short-term market volatility may seem daunting, the key is to prioritize time in the market over trying to time the market. (not investment advice)</p>
