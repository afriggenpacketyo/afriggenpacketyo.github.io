          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, over a million people in the UK experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight. Symptoms include low mood, irritability, and decreased energy, particularly challenging in northern regions with fewer daylight hours. Researchers are exploring creative interventions, such as 'Wintering Well' boxes with therapeutic lamps and activity guides, to encourage outdoor life and establish new 'light routines.' Experts also suggest adopting Scandinavian cultural attitudes towards winter by creating cozy interior light environments and embracing available daylight.</p>

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma Between Manual and Automatic Licenses Amid Shifting Trends</h2>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatic vehicles, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. New drivers face the dilemma of choosing between manual, offering broader driving freedom, or automatic, which some perceive as an easier test. However, automatic lessons can be more expensive and instructors less available, while manual tests surprisingly have a higher pass rate. This trend reflects evolving accessibility and the future dominance of electric vehicles, which lack manual gearboxes.</p>

          <p>Magnesium supplements are experiencing a boom in popularity, with millions taking them for various reasons, including improved sleep, digestion, and mental health. The global market is rapidly expanding, fueled by social media influencers promoting its benefits. Experts, however, caution that while magnesium is crucial for over 300 bodily processes, including brain function and blood sugar regulation, supplements are only effective if one is deficient. Dietitians emphasize prioritizing dietary sources like nuts and whole grains, and advise consulting professionals due to conflicting evidence and potential risks, especially for those with kidney disease.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has hired 36 new immigration judges, including 25 temporary ones, to serve across 16 states, marking the first class to join the immigration courts after months of significant workforce cuts. These new judges, many with backgrounds in federal government or military law, aim to address a backlog of millions of cases that accumulated after over 125 judges were lost this year. The Trump administration's aggressive immigration policies, which increased arrests and deportations, contributed to this backlog. This hiring initiative is intended to restore the integrity and functionality of the Executive Office for Immigration Review.</p>
