          <p>Alex Palou, representing Spain, triumphed at the Indianapolis 500, marking his first win at the event and solidifying his IndyCar career. The race was marred by numerous incidents, including Scott McLaughlin's crash during warm-up laps and Kyle Larson's collision ending his attempt at "the double." Josef Newgarden's bid for a third consecutive win was thwarted by a fuel pump issue, while other drivers experienced brake failures and pit road collisions. Palou held off Marcus Ericsson in the closing laps, securing a Honda 1-2 finish, with David Malukas placing third as the highest-finishing Chevrolet. The article details the series of bizarre events that characterized the race, from crashes to pit lane fires, underscoring the unpredictable nature of the Indy 500.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Jack Grealish from the Manchester City lineup, amid speculation of significant roster changes for the upcoming season. Key players like Kevin De Bruyne are expected to depart, while others, including Kyle Walker and Kalvin Phillips, may also leave after loan spells. New signings are anticipated to strengthen weaker positions, but Guardiola downplays the need for a major rebuild. The club's financial strength, bolstered by Champions League qualification and record revenues, positions them to spend strategically in the transfer market.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani threw a live batting practice session, marking a significant step in his return to pitching 19 months after Tommy John surgery. He threw 22 pitches to hitters, reaching speeds of 94-97 mph with his fastball and incorporating his full repertoire, including his sweeper. Ohtani expressed joy in being back in a simulated environment, joking with coaches and teammates, and is expected to rejoin the rotation after the All-Star break. The Dodgers are proceeding cautiously, understanding the uniqueness of Ohtani's situation, with manager Dave Roberts indicating that he is unlikely to pitch in big-league games until after the All-Star break.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a report by Bitcoin investment firm River, more Americans now hold Bitcoin than gold. The report indicates that 50 million Americans own Bitcoin, compared to 37 million who hold gold. The firm attributes this trend to increased access and cultural acceptance of Bitcoin. A study from The Nakamoto Project found that most American Bitcoin owners were young males, and a teaser from a forthcoming report suggests that many Americans would like to see a portion of U.S. gold reserves converted to Bitcoin.

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, his family is advocating for the square where he died to be commemorated as a historic site that launched a global racial justice movement. While the city council debates development plans, the family envisions a pedestrian plaza with a memorial and shops. A split exists between those wanting to revive business through increased traffic and those prioritizing the memorialization of the site's significance. The conflict reflects the challenge of balancing commemoration and progress in cities following tragedies.</p>

          <h2>New Parenting Style: Emotionally Safe Parenting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Emotionally safe parenting focuses on attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. This approach emphasizes accepting emotions without immediate fixing, responding without shame, and viewing misbehavior as a signal for support rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents prioritize internal work to manage their own triggers, create a safe space for expressing emotions, and consistently accept both easy and difficult traits. This parenting style involves setting boundaries with empathy, preventing shame, and fostering a deeper understanding of the child's emotional landscape.</p>
