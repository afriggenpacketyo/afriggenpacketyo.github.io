          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for an unprecedented compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at up to $1 trillion over a decade. This would be one of the largest corporate pay deals in history, contingent on Tesla achieving aggressive milestones in market capitalization, vehicle deliveries, and the production of robotaxis and humanoid robots. The board emphasized the need to retain and incentivize Musk during a critical growth phase, particularly in autonomous and robotics sectors. This proposal follows a previous $56 billion package that was revoked by a Delaware judge, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of Musk's compensation.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Friday as investors processed a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, which bolstered expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. The regional Stoxx 600 index climbed, with market bets on a rate cut increasing significantly. The U.S. data, showing nonfarm payrolls rising by only 22,000, led to a decline in the U.S. dollar. Shares of Danish wind farm developer Orsted initially rose after securing shareholder approval for a rights issue, despite ongoing legal challenges against the Trump administration regarding offshore wind projects.

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a significant renovation initiative for its U.S. cafes, aiming to create more welcoming and accessible spaces for all customers. The company plans to revamp approximately 1,000 locations by the end of 2026, focusing on increased seating, cozier aesthetics with dark wood paneling, and lighting adjustments for sensory sensitivity. This effort is part of a broader strategy to restore Starbucks' reputation as a "third place" for customers, reversing previous decisions that had reduced seating and outlets. The design incorporates input from baristas and reflects a commitment to inclusive environments, with initial upgrades rolled out in New York and Southern California.</p>

          <p>A spectacular total lunar eclipse, often called a 'Blood Moon,' will be visible this Sunday to observers in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The eclipse, which occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight from reaching the moon, will be at its fullest at 6:12 p.m. UTC. During this celestial event, the moon takes on a striking red or orange hue as some sunlight filters through Earth's atmosphere. Unlike solar eclipses, a total lunar eclipse can be safely viewed with the naked eye, offering a unique astronomical spectacle without the need for special protective equipment.</p>

Coach Hong Myung-bo is considering a new role for captain Son Heung-min, who recently moved to LAFC, potentially shifting him from leader to finisher. The team also welcomes Jens Castrop, a German-Korean midfielder, as its first foreign-born player following FIFA approval of his nation switch, marking a potential trend for the squad. With players like Lee Kang-in and Kim Min-jae seeking more game time, the team aims for a fresh start and improved identity under Hong's experimental approach.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council has decided not to impose penalties on former officials who attended Beijing's Victory Day parade, despite previous warnings. Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh stated that while such actions "failed to actively uphold governmental dignity and defied public expectations," they do not fall under existing legislation restricting retired officials from attending official Beijing celebrations. Hung Hsiu-chu, a former deputy president of Taiwan’s legislature, was among those who attended. This decision reflects a nuanced approach by Taipei, balancing concerns over political optics with legal limitations on punitive measures against its citizens engaging with mainland China.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 07:58:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's new legislation has increased the federal deduction limit for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 for 2025, up from the previous $10,000 cap. This change, which will incrementally rise until 2029 before reverting, offers a significant tax break for itemizing taxpayers, particularly those in high-tax states. Financial experts advise higher earners to be aware of phaseouts, which can create a "SALT torpedo" effect, leading to an artificially high federal tax rate for incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. Strategies like prepaying property and fourth-quarter state income taxes are suggested to maximize the deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's new Environment Minister, Carsten Schneider, is committed to keeping the country on its climate course despite a lack of prior experience in the field and skepticism from some within his own government. Schneider emphasizes Germany's constitutional mandate to achieve climate neutrality by 2045 and its international responsibility for past emissions. While some conservative politicians, including Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have questioned the feasibility and cost of ambitious climate plans, Schneider advocates for a calm, behind-the-scenes approach to implement decisions rather than prolonging politicized debates. He aims to strengthen ties with major emitting countries like China and India ahead of upcoming UN climate conferences.</p>
