          <p>The Baltimore Ravens, currently facing a challenging 1-5 record after their fourth straight loss, are looking forward to the expected return of quarterback Lamar Jackson in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. Jackson has been sidelined for the past two games due to a hamstring injury, during which the Ravens' offense has severely underperformed, managing a combined total of only 13 points. Head coach John Harbaugh expressed strong anticipation for the two-time MVP's comeback, acknowledging the team's urgent need for his leadership and skill to reignite their playoff hopes. This article highlights the significant impact of Jackson's absence and the team's reliance on his return to improve their season's trajectory.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering the invocation of emergency powers, specifically the Insurrection Act of 1807, which would allow President Donald Trump to deploy troops domestically during significant civil unrest, a possibility confirmed by Vice President JD Vance citing out-of-control crime in cities. Simultaneously, President Trump embarked on a trip to Jerusalem, where he is scheduled to meet hostage families and speak at the Knesset, proclaiming that the "war was over" in the Middle East. He expressed confidence in normalizing regional relations following his role in brokering a major peace deal. This article captures the administration's contrasting focuses on domestic security and international diplomatic achievements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have made a strategic adjustment to Shohei Ohtani's pitching schedule for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, delaying his next start until later in the series. Manager Dave Roberts explained that Yoshinobu Yamamoto would start Game 2 instead, which allows Yamamoto to maintain his preferred five-day rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This decision also provides Ohtani additional games to concentrate solely on his hitting, following a challenging offensive performance in the NL Division Series where he struggled at the plate. The article suggests this move prioritizes the team's pitching depth and Ohtani's offensive recalibration for crucial playoff success.</p>

Many were taken from the Nova music festival or Kibbutz Nir Oz, with some having been seen in Hamas videos or having received signs of life through released captives.

Swimming Australia has requested Meta to remove these posts, reaffirming that O’Callaghan has not commented on the issue.

          <p>This article explores the challenges of maintaining adult friendships amidst busy lives, where around half of friends are lost every seven years due to shifting life stages. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco highlights "relational loneliness," the lack of deep platonic bonds, and emphasizes the health benefits of a broad social circle. Experts suggest embracing "messy" lives by integrating friends into daily routines, prioritizing in-person interactions over virtual ones, and overcoming the "liking gap" by trusting friends' affection.

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Reveal Stress Levels by Detecting Nose Temperature Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and monitor recovery. During an experimental stress test, volunteers' noses dipped by 3-6 degrees as blood flow redirected to eyes and ears, a physical response to perceived danger. The lead researcher, Prof Gillian Forrester, suggests this non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for managing harmful stress, identifying anxiety risks, and monitoring stress in non-communicative individuals like babies or apes. The article highlights a novel, objective method for understanding and potentially mitigating stress.</p>

          <p>Dow futures surged after President Trump's conciliatory Truth Social post, stating "Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!" Following Friday's market tumble caused by his threat of 100% tariffs, investors are now leaning into the "TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out) trade," anticipating that maximalist threats are negotiating tactics. Analysts like Michael Brown and Ed Yardeni expect both the U.S. and China to de-escalate, avoiding a deep recession. While Beijing remains defiant on rare earth export controls, Trump's softer tone suggests a potential pullback from the brink, boosting market optimism for a rebound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores India's strategic decision to improve ties with China, highlighted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with President Xi Jinping, where they agreed to be "partners" rather than "rivals." Modi emphasized "strategic autonomy" and not viewing bilateral relations through a "third country lens," a subtle jab at the U.S. This move, including resuming direct flights, offers India a chance to reset historically fraught ties and potentially forge an Eastern coalition against an increasingly hostile West.
