          <h2>India and Pakistan Agree to Cease-Fire with US Mediation Amidst Political Sensitivities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fragile truce between India and Pakistan is holding after a four-day conflict involving drones, missiles, and shelling. President Trump announced the cease-fire was achieved with U.S. mediation, a move praised by Pakistan but met with sensitivity in India, which prefers to frame relations as bilateral. India initially avoided mentioning the U.S. role, fearing domestic perceptions of succumbing to outside pressure. Despite the agreement, uncertainty remains about the long-term stability of the cease-fire, as both countries claim victory and civilians express relief but remain cautious. Relevant context: The conflict was initiated following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, escalating tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar to serve as Air Force One. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions surrounding the legality of the move, as a new commercial Boeing 747-800 costs roughly $400 million. The administration will retrofit the plane so it can be used in Trump's official capacity as president, and the plane is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term.</p>

The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices and has been pressuring China to curb exports of fentanyl precursors.
