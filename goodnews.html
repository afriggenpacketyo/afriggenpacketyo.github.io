          <h2>Trump Issues Executive Order on Drug Prices, Faces Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 15:14:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices in the United States, but it lacks clear legal authority to mandate price reductions. The order directs federal agencies to investigate why European countries obtain lower prices and encourages them to pay more. The move follows House Republicans' proposal of health care policy changes that would cut Medicaid and Obamacare marketplaces. While pharmaceutical stocks initially dropped, they rebounded upon learning the details of the executive order, and industry groups have voiced concerns about looking to other countries for drug pricing models.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proposing to raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, as part of President Trump's tax and spending package. The SALT deduction limit has been a contentious issue in tax bill negotiations. The current $10,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action, and lawmakers from high-tax states are prioritizing raising the cap.</p>

          <p>U.S. tariff receipts surged to a record $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade policies, which helped to reduce the budget deficit. Customs duties for the month were 86% higher than in March and more than double the previous year. While the U.S. still faces a substantial budget deficit, the increase in tariff revenue contributed to a surplus for April. High interest rates continue to pose a budgetary challenge, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion for the month.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced tighter British immigration rules, declaring an end to what he termed a "failed experiment in open borders." The new regulations will make it more difficult to obtain work, family, and student visas to the UK, requiring higher-level English proficiency tests and longer residency periods for citizenship. Employers will also face restrictions on recruiting overseas workers, particularly for low-skilled jobs. Critics have raised concerns that Starmer's rhetoric could incite violence against migrants, while others argue the proposals do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>A temporary reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods is expected to trigger a surge in freight shipments, potentially leading to increased container rates and higher prices for consumers. The 30% tariffs will allow some businesses to resume shipments, but the uncertainty surrounding a permanent deal is driving front-loading of inventory. Critical industries are reporting low inventory levels, and a spike in ocean freight prices is anticipated. Despite the pause, some retail niches continue to face much higher tariffs.</p>
