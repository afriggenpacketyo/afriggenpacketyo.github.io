          <p>Ben Griscti, a player for the Adelaide 36ers, is recovering from a fractured vertebra after a basketball backboard collapsed during a practice session. The incident, which occurred after a teammate's dunk, has sidelined Griscti for the start of Australia's National Basketball League season. Despite a hospital being nearby, an ambulance took approximately 90 minutes to arrive due to other emergencies in the territory. Griscti is reported to be in stable condition, and the injury is not expected to require surgery, with no current timetable for his return to play.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy expanded more than anticipated in the second quarter, achieving its fastest growth rate since September 2023. The country's GDP increased by 1.8% year-over-year, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6% and the previous quarter's 1.3%. This growth was primarily fueled by domestic spending, including household and government consumption, with net trade also contributing positively. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates and noted an easing of financial conditions, though it revised down its full-year economic growth forecast due to a lower outlook for productivity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California legislators have approved a bill mandating that schools notify families and teachers when immigration enforcement agents are present on campuses. This measure, authored by State Senator Sasha Renée Pérez, aims to inform and empower school communities amid the Trump administration's aggressive deportation campaigns. The legislation, which awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, would apply to K-12 schools, state universities, and community colleges, creating a system similar to existing emergency alerts. Supporters emphasize the importance of students feeling safe to learn, citing concerns over immigration agents arresting individuals near schools.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is entering an early-stage branding supercycle, suggesting a global embrace of Chinese brands beyond traditional consumer products. The success of Pop Mart's Labubu dolls, which are now forecasting US$4 billion in sales, demonstrates a shift in perception from 'cheap' to 'trusted.' The article highlights this brand muscle extending into industrial sectors like batteries (CATL) and electric vehicles (Xiaomi, BYD), where components are becoming recognized names. This signifies a broader change in the Chinese business mindset, moving from cost advantage to brand advantage.</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully used a discrete hand signal, popularized on TikTok, to escape a domestic violence situation at a 7-Eleven. A bystander recognized the gesture—tucking the thumb into the palm and covering it with four fingers—and called 911. Police quickly responded, arresting the suspect, John Palombi, who attempted to flee and was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. The Canadian Women’s Foundation created the signal in 2020 to provide a widely recognized, silent method for survivors to seek help during isolation.</p>

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, former chief of staff to Sir Keir Starmer, has questioned the government's decision to restrict a civil service internship scheme to students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." Gray, who comes from a working-class background herself, argued that a wider range of exposure is beneficial and sought the evidence base for the change. The government maintains the policy aims to diversify the civil service, while critics like Baroness Finn raised concerns about potential discrimination against other working-class children and reduced talent pools. This article highlights the debate over meritocracy and social mobility in public service.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B was cleared of assault charges by a Los Angeles jury in a civil lawsuit brought by a security guard. Emani Ellis had alleged that Cardi B scratched her face with a fingernail and spat on her outside an obstetrician's office in 2018, seeking $24 million in damages. Cardi B testified that the incident was a heated verbal altercation, denying any physical contact, and stated her pregnancy was not publicly known at the time. The jury deliberated for approximately one hour before finding the Grammy-winning artist not liable for assault, battery, or emotional distress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled against the U.S. Department of Justice's most severe proposed penalties in a landmark antitrust case against Google, allowing the company to retain its Chrome browser. The judge, Amit Mehta, stated that the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) significantly "changed the course of this case." While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court determined that the highly competitive and rapidly evolving AI market prevents Google from using similar anticompetitive tactics. The ruling bars exclusive contracts involving payments but mandates sharing search data.</p>

          <p>A divided U.S. appeals court has allowed Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, to resume her role, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to remove her. The District of Columbia circuit court ruled 2-1 that FTC commissioners cannot be fired by a president without cause, citing nearly a century of clear legal precedent. Slaughter, who was appointed by Trump in 2018 and later to a second term by Biden, expressed eagerness to return to work. This article highlights the ongoing legal dispute over the independence of regulatory agencies, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser but must share information with competitors and cease exclusive contracts. The decision follows a years-long antitrust battle over Google's dominance in online search. While Google can continue paying distributors for default placement, it is barred from entering exclusive agreements for its search engine, Chrome, Google Assistant, or Gemini app. Google hailed the ruling as a victory, suggesting the rise of AI influenced the outcome, though competitors like DuckDuckGo argue the remedies do not go far enough.</p>

          <p>A new book, 'Power and the Palace' by Valentine Low, has revealed several anecdotes about the British royal family, including Queen Camilla's experience of fighting off a sexual assault as a teenager. The book recounts Camilla telling Boris Johnson in 2008 how she used her shoe to defend herself and ensured the perpetrator's arrest. This revelation aligns with Queen Camilla's public campaigning against domestic abuse and violence against women. The article also touches on Queen Elizabeth II's private views on Brexit, royal funding negotiations, and the government's push for a 'maximalist' Coronation ceremony.</p>

          <p>Hawaii’s Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, spewing lava 330 feet into the air from its summit crater. This marks the 32nd eruption episode since December 2024, with all lava currently contained within the Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma continuously rises from the Earth's interior, building pressure until it forces out older, degassed magma, creating the dramatic fountains. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes, and while scientists can predict eruptions days in advance, the ultimate duration or changes in its activity remain uncertain.</p>
