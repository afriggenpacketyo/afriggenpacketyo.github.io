          <p>A federal judge in New York dismissed Justin Baldoni's lawsuit against Blake Lively, which stemmed from a legal feud that began in December 2024. Judge Lewis J. Liman dismissed Baldoni's $400 million countersuit against Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds, and others, including a defamation claim against The New York Times. Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a "total victory" and plan to seek attorneys' fees and damages against Baldoni. The case originated from Lively's complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us," which he denied.</p>

          <p>Canada has committed to meeting NATO's 2% defense spending target within a year, significantly boosting its military budget.

This decision comes amid increasing global threats and concerns about Canada's military preparedness, with plans to invest in new submarines, aircraft, ships, and other equipment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The clean energy transition is heavily reliant on the availability of critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for producing clean energy technologies. Demand for these minerals is expected to surge in the coming years, but their uneven distribution and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. The US is a major consumer but not a significant producer of these minerals, leading to concerns about economic and national security. Efforts are underway to increase domestic production, find alternative materials, and improve recycling processes to address the critical mineral constraints.</p>
