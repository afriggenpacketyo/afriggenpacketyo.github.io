          <p>HSBC has proposed a deal to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private, valuing the Hong Kong lender at over $37 billion. The offer represents a significant premium over Hang Seng's recent average share price, causing its shares to surge nearly 30%. HSBC stated the move underscores its commitment to Hong Kong as a key financial hub and aims to unlock new growth opportunities for both banks. The privatization is seen by some analysts as a positive step to resolve governance issues associated with parent-subsidiary dual listings. (not investment advice)</p>

The agreement entails the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed-upon line. Following the announcement, the Israel Defense Forces began operational preparations to implement the ceasefire and adjust their deployment.

After earning four points from their first two matches, the team aims for victories in upcoming home games against Greece and Belarus. Achieving these wins would elevate their points total to ten, which could be enough to secure at least second place in their group. The outcome also depends on Greece's performance in their next matches, but a successful run for Scotland would put them in a commanding position.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Gaza Ceasefire Represents Major Breakthrough but Path to Lasting Peace Remains Uncertain</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas marks a significant diplomatic breakthrough, largely attributed to the personal intervention of Donald Trump. While the first phase involves releasing hostages and withdrawing some troops, the article notes that crucial, unresolved issues could derail a permanent peace. Key challenges include the disarmament of Hamas, the future governance of Gaza, and political pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from his ultranationalist coalition partners. The agreement brings hope but does not guarantee an end to the two-year conflict, as both sides still have deep-seated suspicions and conflicting long-term goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a pioneering solar thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring a world-first dual-tower design that feeds a single turbine system. The plant uses nearly 27,000 mirrors to focus sunlight onto two 200-meter towers, heating molten salt to store energy and generate electricity even after sunset. This configuration is estimated to be 25% more effective than a single-tower design while requiring fewer mirrors, a significant cost saving. The project represents a notable advancement in concentrated solar power technology, enhancing China's renewable energy capabilities.</p>

The article provides a rare glimpse into the secretive deliberation process, highlighting the pressure the committee faces from international lobbying efforts. While Trump has been nominated and has touted his role in brokering peace deals, experts suggest his withdrawal from international agreements and polarizing rhetoric make him an unlikely choice.
