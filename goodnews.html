          <h2>Europe Embraces Rail Travel While America Remains Stuck in Traffic</h2>

          <p>Dan Richards' guest essay in the New York Times contrasts the revitalized sleeper train network in Europe with the declining state of long-distance public transport in the United States. In Europe, night trains are making a comeback due to climate concerns and efforts to compete with short-haul flights, while the U.S. continues to prioritize cars and underfund public infrastructure. The article highlights the correlation between car dependence and decreased happiness in American drivers, and criticizes the U.S.'s focus on unproven transportation projects rather than investing in rail networks. The piece advocates for revitalizing railways in America as a means to foster community, connection, and a shared sense of purpose.</p>

          <p>A rare and intense dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, including Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings. The storm, driven by winds up to 70 miles per hour from thunderstorms, originated near Bloomington, Illinois, and created a dramatic scene as it moved into downtown Chicago. This event marked the first time the Weather Service had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago itself. The dust storm was attributed to exceptionally dry soil conditions in the region, reminiscent of the Dust Bowl era, and is referred to as a haboob due to its origin from thunderstorm winds.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a hiker who went missing for weeks in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, recounted her survival story after being found in a cabin. She said she was trapped by an avalanche and immobilized by a fall, during which she splinted her leg and reset her knee. Slaton survived by foraging for wild leeks and melting snow for water, also making tea from manzanita and pine needles. She lost her tent and sleeping bags, relying only on a lighter and a knife, before being rescued by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, driven by the United States' shift away from global leadership under President Trump.

Despite challenges in negotiating the new relationship, the overarching theme is to push ahead in a world where the United States is pulling back.

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fiber-optic gyroscope that offers enhanced stability across a wide temperature range, making it suitable for use in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, improves the accuracy of inertial navigation systems, which are vital for military and security applications because they do not rely on external signals and are immune to interference. The device uses the movement of light in optical fibers to sense orientation and turning rates, offering a simpler structure and higher resolution compared to traditional mechanical gyroscopes.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly considering expanding unpaid work for convicted criminals, potentially assigning them tasks such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to make community service more impactful, with earnings from offenders' work going to a fund for victim's groups. This proposal comes amid overcrowding in prisons, pushing the government to explore alternative punishments. The plan would involve collaboration between probation teams and local councils, as well as private companies employing offenders, in an effort to ensure that "crime doesn't pay."</p>

          <p>Journalism came from behind to win the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes, with jockey Umberto Rispoli becoming the first from Italy to win any of the Triple Crown races. Journalism burst through the lane and shrugged off contact with other horses to secure the victory. The win comes after Journalism finished second in the Kentucky Derby, and the trainer said that this victory symbolizes so much about life, and the horse's guts to win.</p>

          <p>There could be a second Scottish independence referendum if the public show "overwhelming support" for one, according to Michael Gove. Last week, First Minister John Swinney said that he wanted to achieve "demonstrable support" for independence. Surprisingly, Mr Gove has found himself sharing the same position as First Minister John Swinney on the issue of an independence referendum. Gove was part of a government that rejected requests from the Scottish government for a second referendum.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, the men who murdered their wealthy parents by shooting them 16 times, are possibly about to get the sympathy and forgiveness of the masses. Thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters. This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. Their fate will then be in the hands of California's Parole Board and, ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>
