          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing to include their dogs in their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral members of the family. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, flower girls, and official greeters, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are seen as providing significant emotional support. To meet this demand, specialized dog chaperone services have emerged, which handle all aspects of the pet's involvement, from transportation to grooming and practicing their role. This trend highlights the deepening bond between humans and their pets, with many owners considering their dogs to be like children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk and his social media company, X, have reached a settlement in principle with former employees who sued for $500 million in unpaid severance. The lawsuit was filed after Musk's 2022 takeover of the platform, then called Twitter, led to the termination of approximately 6,000 workers. The former employees argued they were denied promised severance packages, with some receiving only one month's pay or nothing at all. While details of the agreement have not been made public, the parties have requested a postponement of a court hearing to finalize the terms, potentially closing a significant legal chapter from the tumultuous acquisition.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, may have set a new junior world record after catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass. The catch occurred during a family fishing trip in Tomales Bay and outweighs the young angler by only about 15 pounds. The family is now working with the International Game Fish Association to certify the catch, which would break the previous junior record of 59 pounds set in 2002. The impressive feat has brought local fame to the eighth-grader, highlighting a memorable moment of skill and luck in the world of sport fishing.</p>

Investors expect the speech to provide crucial signals regarding the central bank's future policy, particularly whether a rate cut is likely in September. Powell is navigating a complex environment, balancing inflation concerns against a softening labor market, all while facing political pressure from the Trump administration. His address will also touch upon the Fed's long-term policy framework review, potentially indicating shifts in its approach to managing inflation and unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Miami has ordered the closure of the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility within 60 days, citing severe and irreparable damage to the Florida Everglades. Judge Kathleen Williams's ruling blocks any new detainees from being brought to the remote tented camp and requires the removal of construction materials and fencing. The decision is a significant victory for a coalition of environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe, who argued the facility's hasty construction violated environmental protection laws. The ruling represents a setback for the Trump administration's immigration detention and deportation agenda.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has eradicated a large-scale illegal marijuana cultivation site within Sequoia National Park, removing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The operation caused significant environmental damage, including diverting a creek, clearing natural vegetation, and contaminating the area with hazardous pesticides like methamidophos, which is banned in the U.S. This raid is part of a decades-long effort to combat illicit grows operated by drug-trafficking organizations in the park's remote wilderness. These farms pose a severe threat to the park's delicate ecosystem, wildlife, and downstream water sources.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new voluntary guidelines for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt content and cease promoting snack products for infants under one year old. The guidance also aims to restrict marketing claims that suggest health benefits without scientific backing. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given 18 months to comply with the new recommendations, with the government stating it will consider alternative measures if the industry fails to make sufficient changes.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed confusion over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite a strong quarterly performance and an upgraded full-year forecast. He described the quarter as exceptionally good for any retailer, noting that the company is successfully growing its top line and expanding margins while absorbing tariff impacts. Simon suggested that investors may have overreacted to a narrow earnings miss caused by one-time expenses rather than systemic issues. He now believes Walmart's value proposition is effectively retaining the high-income shoppers it attracted during the peak of inflation. (not investment advice)</p>
