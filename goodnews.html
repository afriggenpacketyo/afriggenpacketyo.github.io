          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, about the length of an index finger, had a pencil sharpener-like mouth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing a more complex structure than previously known in radiodonts. The well-preserved fossil showed the Mosura's open circulatory system and swimming style similar to modern stingrays. </p>

The Spaniard's showing was his team's best of what has so far been a difficult year and it comes as a result of a major upgrade on the car that has - at least partly - been influenced by their new managing technical partner, Adrian Newey, the design legend who joined in March. He emphasized that while he was "happy to be fifth", it was not close to his or the team's ambitions. </p>
