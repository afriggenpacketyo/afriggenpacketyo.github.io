          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are set for a generally positive opening as investors await a crucial slate of economic data from China. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast China's third-quarter GDP growth to slow to 4.8% year-on-year, a decrease from the prior quarter's 5.2%. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index futures indicate a stronger start, contrasting with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 opening slightly lower. US markets closed higher on Friday, influenced by a more conciliatory tone regarding trade talks with China and a recovery from regional bank concerns.

          <p>Max Verstappen of Red Bull secured a dominant victory at the United States Grand Prix in Austin, further intensifying the championship battle against McLaren drivers. Lando Norris finished second, with Oscar Piastri in fifth, reducing Piastri's championship lead to 14 points over Norris. Verstappen's win, his seventh at this event and fifth of the season, came after converting pole position into an early lead, despite a different tire strategy from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. The race saw a virtual safety car period due to a collision, and Norris eventually overtook Leclerc with five laps remaining. The score reflects a strong performance.</p>

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing rapid growth, expanding three times faster than the firsthand market, projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. This surge highlights the critical role of authentication, as sophisticated counterfeits, or "superfakes," make verification challenging even for luxury brands. Resale platforms like Carousell and Bunjang are investing heavily in proprietary authentication systems, combining visual inspections, scientific equipment, and AI to ensure product legitimacy. This focus on trust is boosting business, particularly among younger consumers who value affordability, rarity, and the ability to resell items, reshaping how people engage with luxury goods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area utilized by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the finding, while the Secret Service released a photo of what appeared to be a platform or hunting stand high in a tree. Sources indicate the stand was over 200 yards away, across a highway, and likely present for months, only becoming a concern as Trump resumed using that part of the airport after construction. Officials stated there was no impact on movements and no individuals were present, contrasting with a previous assassination attempt near Trump's golf club.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Five Year Plan (2026-2030) is expected to outline key national goals, building on historical plans that have profoundly reshaped the global economy. This article examines three pivotal plans: the 1981-84 "Reform and Opening Up" that fueled China's rise as a manufacturing hub, leading to the "China shock" and the outsourcing of Western jobs; the 2011-15 focus on "strategic emerging industries" like green technology, establishing China's dominance in renewables and critical mineral supply chains; and the current 2021-2025 "high quality development" plan, aiming for technological leadership and challenging US dominance. These plans demonstrate China's long-term strategic policy-making.</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a "light sprain" to his right wrist during a preseason game but is expected to be ready for the regular-season opener. The injury occurred after a hard fall following a dunk from a Luka Doncic lob, highlighting the ongoing adjustment for new bigs to Doncic's unique passing style. Despite the injury, the chemistry between Hayes and Doncic is developing strongly, with Hayes even pursuing Slovenian citizenship to potentially join Doncic on the national team. Coach JJ Redick noted missed assist opportunities, indicating the team is still refining its coordination with Doncic.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce new vocational V-level courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify England's "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels are intended to replace Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with ministers also proposing an alternative to GCSE maths and English resits. While subjects are yet to be fully detailed, the initiative seeks to boost vocational training, aligning with a target for two-thirds of young people to pursue university or technical routes. However, concerns exist about whether V-levels will adequately fill the gap left by BTecs, emphasizing the need for clarity in implementation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the current multipolar world, marked by the transition from American unipolarity, requires managed accommodation rather than rigid alliances to prevent catastrophic conflict, drawing lessons from Richard Nixon and Zhou Enlai's 1970s diplomacy. The author identifies two distinguishing factors: nuclear weapons making total war irrational, and technological interdependence creating immense costs for systemic rupture. Despite the inherent complexities of modern supply chains and financial ties, the article suggests these factors create powerful incentives for major economies to avoid a breakdown, advocating for patient statecraft over confrontation in navigating great power competition.</p>
