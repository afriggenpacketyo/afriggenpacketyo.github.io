        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seventy years after Ruth Ellis was hanged for murder, her grandchildren are seeking a posthumous pardon, arguing she was a victim of severe domestic abuse. Ellis, a nightclub hostess, shot her "abusive" lover, David Blakely, in 1955. Her legal team contends that modern understanding of trauma and slow-burn provocation would likely have resulted in a manslaughter charge, not murder. The case, which inspired films, significantly influenced public opinion against the death penalty in the UK, leading to its eventual abolition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has approved Julia Koch's purchase of a 10% stake in the New York Giants, valuing the team at $10.3 billion, marking the highest valuation for a minority NFL team sale. This deal, along with other limited partner sales for the New England Patriots and San Francisco 49ers, highlights a sharp increase in NFL team values. The escalation is attributed to expectations of significantly higher media rights deals and the recent introduction of private equity investors, boosting valuations and liquidity in the league.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly considering tax system changes that could increase payments for lawyers, accountants, and doctors using limited liability partnerships (LLPs). The proposed measure would impose a new charge, aiming to align their taxation closer to employees' National Insurance contributions. This move is anticipated as Reeves seeks to raise taxes in her November Budget to meet fiscal rules, focusing on "those with the broadest shoulders." While potentially raising billions, critics warn it could disincentivize work and negatively impact small practices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A south-west London council has reversed a £150 fine issued to a woman for pouring a small amount of coffee down a road gully. Burcu Yesilyurt was stopped by enforcement officers, unaware that such an action was illegal, believing she was preventing littering. The council reviewed body-worn footage and cancelled the fine, acknowledging the contravention was "minor" and that her appeal would likely succeed. Yesilyurt welcomed the decision and called for clearer public signage regarding such obscure regulations.</p>

          <p>GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik has held multiple discussions with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman regarding OpenAI's power requirements, underscoring the critical role of energy for AI growth. Strazik confirmed GE Vernova's position as a key power equipment provider for major hyperscalers, with electrical equipment orders from this sector nearly doubling year-to-date. Despite strong demand and topping third-quarter expectations, GE Vernova's shares fell, partly due to the company not raising its 2025 forecast and ongoing challenges in onshore wind. The company is also expanding its portfolio with a significant acquisition in transformer manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>
