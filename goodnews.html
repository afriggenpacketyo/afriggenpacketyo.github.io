          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S√°nchez held their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrity guests including Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates. The lavish, multi-day event took place on the historic island of San Giorgio Maggiore, with festivities beginning on Thursday. However, the celebration also sparked the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, as local residents protested the influx of ultra-wealthy tourists, which they argue contributes to rising costs and over-tourism in the city. The event highlights a growing tension between high-profile tourism and local community interests in popular European destinations.</p>

His peaceful surrender marks the capture of the ninth of ten inmates who broke out of the Orleans Justice Center in May.

Cramer expressed concern for Constellation Brands, suggesting its sales may be impacted by the rise of weight-loss drugs, the growing preference for cannabis, and the effects of immigration policy on its core Hispanic consumer base.

Hazlewood's impressive spell, which earned him figures of 5-43, was instrumental in dismantling the West Indies' batting lineup and securing the emphatic win for Australia with two full days of play to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. This move is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. Supported by Governor Gavin Newsom and industry unions, the legislation aims to reverse job losses and solidify California's status as the heart of the entertainment industry by making it more financially attractive for studios to film locally.</p>

Edelman also argues that increased human longevity makes the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio obsolete, creating a need for higher-growth potential assets like crypto for effective long-term planning.
