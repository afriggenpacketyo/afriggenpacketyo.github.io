          <p>South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung has vowed to prioritize pragmatism to address the crises resulting from the martial law declared by his predecessor. In his inaugural address, Lee emphasized unity, flexible pragmatism, and restoring the nation's economy and security. He also stressed the importance of strengthening cooperation with the United States and Japan, while seeking practical relations with neighboring countries. Lee faces immediate challenges, including trade negotiations with the US and navigating relations with North Korea, while remaining prepared for any potential military provocations.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has achieved a fuel-efficient orbit synchronized with the Earth and moon's motion, but claims of it being the first to do so are disputed. The 3:1 resonant orbit is seen as a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, including navigation systems for interplanetary exploration. Experts from the US and Canada argue that NASA's IBEX probe achieved a similar orbit in 2011. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1 can definitively claim the title of the first spacecraft to achieve this feat.</p>

          <p>The Okhotsk Tokkari Center, Japan's only seal sanctuary, rescues and rehabilitates injured seals with a unique approach: staff avoid naming or direct contact to minimize emotional attachment before releasing them back into the wild. Despite these efforts, staff still form bonds with the seals they care for. The center, established in the 1980s, has rescued over 200 seals, but only about 40% are successfully returned to the sea. The center also educates the public about seal ecology and conservation, hoping to inspire greater interest in animal and environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce ¬£15 billion in funding for transport projects in mayoral authorities across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country. The investment will focus on tram, train, and bus projects, with significant allocations for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. This move marks a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the south-east. The funding aims to address regional inequalities and provide improved transport infrastructure in areas facing economic challenges.</p>
