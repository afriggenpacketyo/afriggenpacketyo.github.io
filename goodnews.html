          <h2>American Alcohol Consumption Declines to Record Low, Gallup Poll Indicates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll reveals that only 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, marking a record low since 1939. This decline is linked to increasing public awareness of alcohol's health risks, even in moderation. Younger demographics, aged 18-34, show a particularly strong trend towards abstaining and perceiving moderate drinking as harmful. Experts suggest societal shifts, like the popularity of alcohol-free challenges and the cost of alcohol, also contribute to this generational change.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Virginia Tech have published a study showing that pet dogs can effectively detect the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. This pest poses a significant threat to various plants and agriculture, prompting states to urge their eradication. Dogs, with their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in outdoor, real-world conditions, outperforming human searches. This breakthrough offers a promising new method for controlling the spread of this destructive insect.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports a significant increase in chikungunya virus cases in the UK, with over 70 reported in the first six months of the year, more than double the previous year. All cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region, including India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius, where an outbreak is ongoing. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe fever and joint pain that may persist for years. The UKHSA advises travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits with black, horn-like growths have sparked alarm online, leading to descriptions like "zombie-rabbits." Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, attributing the growths to the relatively harmless Shope Papilloma Virus. This disease, spread by fleas and ticks, is common in the Midwest and causes papillomas that typically disappear as the rabbit's immune system fights the virus. While not transmissible to humans or pets, the phenomenon is believed to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully contained a small brush fire that burned one acre in Ernest E. Debs Regional Park in Highland Park on Wednesday afternoon. The blaze, fanned by light winds, posed no immediate threat to nearby homes and required no evacuations. One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion while responding to the incident amidst summer heat. Helicopters assisted by dropping water on the dry brush, and hand crews remained on scene to clear any hotspots. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record-breaking glacier-related flooding from the Mendenhall River, which peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. The waters have since receded, and the immediate flood threat has ended, largely due to the effectiveness of newly installed "Hesco" barriers. This annual phenomenon, caused by water escaping Suicide Basin near the Mendenhall Glacier, has previously caused widespread damage and swept away homes. City officials expressed relief that the temporary barriers protected hundreds of properties, preventing a catastrophic event.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones on work trips. This trend, known as "bleisure," allows professionals to reclaim family time and enjoy cost savings by combining work with personal travel. Travelers often cover additional leisure expenses themselves and may not openly disclose these arrangements to their companies. While generally accepted if business objectives are met and costs are managed, some corporations view it as a "policy grey zone" regarding expenses and liability.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is significantly closer to losing his Infowars show and brand, as a Texas state judge ordered the company's assets to be turned over to a receiver. These assets will be sold to pay the families of Sandy Hook victims, who won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones for spreading false conspiracies. The ruling paves the way for the seizure of Infowars' property and brand, potentially leading to its quick end. This development marks a major step towards accountability for Jones's "monstrously cruel harassment," though he vows to continue broadcasting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. Based on data from 148,500 people in Sweden, the research found medication linked to reductions in first-time instances and recurrent events across these categories. Researchers believe these benefits stem from medication's ability to reduce impulsive behavior and improve concentration. The findings provide crucial evidence of wider long-term benefits, helping patients weigh treatment options, despite known side-effects and access challenges.</p>
