        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in a 4-3 decision, has struck down the state's 176-year-old abortion ban. The liberal-majority court ruled that the 1849 law, which made performing an abortion a felony, was superseded by a 1985 law that permits abortions until fetal viability. The ruling provides legal certainty for abortion access in the state, which had been in question since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The decision resolves a lawsuit filed by the state's Democratic attorney general and solidifies the legality of abortions that had resumed after a lower court's 2023 ruling.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 10:17:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as a source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce their reliance on China, which dominates the global market. A recent report indicates Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in early 2025, a shift driven by security concerns and China's tightening of its own drone export controls. While a complete decoupling from China is considered unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and chips. This trend reflects a broader European effort to achieve defense autonomy and build "non-red" supply chains independent of Chinese influence.</p>

          <p>After a period of record-breaking high temperatures, cooler and more comfortable weather conditions have set in across the United Kingdom, marking an end to the recent heatwave. While Tuesday was the hottest day of the year so far, forecasts for the next ten days do not predict a return to heatwave conditions, with temperatures expected to be significantly lower. A yellow weather warning for thunderstorms has been issued for parts of Scotland and northeast England. The shift provides relief, but concerns about low water levels and potential drought remain after an exceptionally dry spring.</p>

The princess emphasized that cancer is a "life-changing experience" for both the patient and their families, and that finding a "new normal" is a rollercoaster that takes time. This was her first public engagement since she withdrew from Royal Ascot to better balance her return to public duties.</p>

          <p>A report from market research firm Yole Group forecasts that mainland China will overtake Taiwan in semiconductor foundry capacity by 2030. China's global share is projected to grow to 30 percent by the end of the decade, up from its current 21 percent. This growth underscores the significant progress of Beijing's push for technological self-sufficiency, despite ongoing U.S. tech restrictions aimed at curbing its semiconductor industry. The report highlights the increasing role of domestic Chinese fabs in meeting this goal, signaling a major shift in the global chipmaking landscape. (not investment advice)</p>
