          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and author, as the new Surgeon General after Dr. Janette Nesheiwat withdrew her nomination due to scrutiny over her medical credentials. Means, known for her advocacy against the pharmaceutical and food industries, co-authored the book 'Good Energy' and founded Levels, a company offering continuous glucose monitors. She has expressed concerns about some vaccines and the FDA, and participated in a roundtable on American health hosted by Senator Ron Johnson. Means is expected to work closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to implement Trump's health agenda.</p>

          <h2>Salt Lake City and Boise Adopt Official Pride Flags to Circumvent Republican Bans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:43:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to Republican-led state legislatures banning 'unofficial flags' on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted inventive workarounds by changing their official flags. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed and the city council approved three new city flags, each featuring the city's traditional sego lily design imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag after the state legislature passed a similar ban. These actions are a direct response to what local leaders see as an attack on LGBTQ+ rights by the Trump administration and conservative legislatures.</p>

          <p>Nvidia shares increased after the Trump administration announced plans to rescind the 'AI diffusion rule,' which would have imposed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce stated that the rule was overly complex and bureaucratic, hindering American innovation. Nvidia welcomed the decision, stating it would allow America to lead the next industrial revolution. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need for a balance between national security and boosting the American chip industry, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed concerns about being locked out of the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly stated that Canada has been 'over reliant on the US for too long' and aims to forge closer ties with the UK, EU, and other nations. This comes after tense relations between the US and Canada, with Trump imposing tariffs on Canadian industries. Joly emphasized the importance of asserting Canada's sovereignty while seeking a 'new trade and security partnership' with the US. The Prime Minister is assembling his cabinet and has invited King Charles III to formally open parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty.</p>
