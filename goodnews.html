        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from the UK's Department for Education suggest a strong correlation between student attendance in the first week of the school year and their attendance for the remainder of the term. The data shows that over half of pupils who were partially absent during the initial week in September 2024 later became "persistently absent," missing at least 10% of school. In response, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging schools and parents to prioritize full attendance from the start of the new term to combat the high absenteeism rates that have persisted since the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has decided not to run for reelection in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. First elected in 2014, Ernst was the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and the first woman from Iowa in the chamber. Her departure will create an open seat, and Representative Ashley Hinson is reportedly planning to enter the race. Ernst's tenure included leadership roles and notable moments, such as her controversial vote to confirm Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and her outspoken advocacy for federal budget cuts.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to global diplomacy. Amid a dysfunctional international system often paralyzed by competing national interests, Indonesia's status as an economic powerhouse with ties to multiple ideological camps allows it to act as a bridge. The author argues that Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a corrective model for international relations. This approach prioritizes practical cooperation over ideological confrontation, potentially offering a new road map for a more functional world order.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, fulfilling a lifelong dream for the filmmaker. The ambitious Netflix project stars Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation, exploring the story from both characters' perspectives over a 149-minute runtime. Del Toro emphasized his desire to portray the creature with beauty and as a newborn, rather than a disfigured victim. Early reviews are mixed, with some praising its epic scale and artistry, while others found it lacked the necessary emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>The current US Open has been marked by a series of notable player outbursts, including incidents involving Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, and Jelena Ostapenko. This article explores the potential reasons for the heightened drama, suggesting a combination of factors such as the intense New York City atmosphere and the passionate, vocal crowds. Players like Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff also point to the stress of it being the final Grand Slam of a long and grueling season. Many of the players involved also have a history of volatile on-court behavior, which is amplified by the high-stakes environment.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article examines how remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could foster better bilateral relations. It highlights a forgotten aspect of the war where American airmen and Chinese villagers supported each other against the Japanese army, creating a bond of mutual assistance. The piece suggests that recalling these historical instances of collaboration could provide a foundation for improving ties from the ground up. This historical perspective is presented as a potential formula for navigating current geopolitical complexities between the two nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a proposal to silence its historic town clock during nighttime hours. The request came from the owner of the Wynnstay Hotel, who cited regular complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, especially after a recent £55,000 restoration of the 150-year-old landmark. The hotel owner expressed disappointment with the decision and is considering gathering wider community feedback for a future proposal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article synthesizes expert consensus on safe screen time limits for children, emphasizing that guidelines should align with developmental stages. Pediatricians and psychologists generally recommend a "screen-free until age three" approach to allow for crucial exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. For older children, the focus shifts from a strict time limit to the quality of content and ensuring digital interaction does not replace essential real-world social skills, imagination, and physical activity. Parents are advised to engage with their children about their digital lives and establish clear rules for the whole family.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded Jack Grealish's performance after the player, on loan from Manchester City, delivered another man-of-the-match display in a 3-2 win at Wolves. Grealish, who has provided multiple assists in consecutive games, has quickly become a key player for Everton after spending much of last season on the bench at his parent club. Moyes described Grealish as "better than I thought" and a "maverick" who adds a creative edge to the team. The player's resurgence in form has raised questions about his potential return to the England national team squad.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Powys, organized a rescue effort to move thousands of fish after a local waterway, Aberhafesp Brook, dried up due to prolonged dry weather. A local man, Dave Lister, discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a small remaining puddle and, after not receiving an urgent response from Natural Resources Wales (NRW), rallied friends to help. They successfully relocated salmon, trout, and other species to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm than good, but the rescuers felt it was better than leaving them to die.</p>
