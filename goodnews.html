          <p>Pope Leo XIV, the first American-born pope, led Mass on Sunday, calling for peace and wishing everyone a Happy Mother's Day. He represents both continuity and change for the Catholic Church. He is described as a tennis-loving, Wordle-playing, White Sox fan from Chicago, and a former math major. Pope Leo XIV has identified artificial intelligence as one of the biggest threats and is embracing his predecessor's ideals of a more inclusive church. He spent 20 years in Peru as a missionary and became a citizen there.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to require firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country. The changes are expected to cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled visas over the next year and will include raising the threshold for skilled visas and narrowing exceptions for temporary shortage visas. These changes are intended to encourage training and employment of UK residents.</p>

          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem "Infant Longing" explores themes of love, loss, and the cyclical nature of the world, which begins and ends with the slaughter of the innocent. The speaker expresses a deep longing and seeks solace in a kiss that both seals and opens their mouth, eyes, and soul. The poem reflects on the speaker's mother, who found and buried her own among the slaughtered, and offered her longing as sustenance. It delves into the connection between the speaker and a lover, and their ability to transcend time and see the infinite longing beyond beginnings and ends.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges of balancing parenthood and friendship, and how some families are choosing to create a village of support by living near their friends. Charlotte and Raffi Grinberg moved next door to their best friends, and another couple bought a home in the same row, to share child-care responsibilities and build a stronger community. The article highlights the benefits of alloparenting, or relying on adults who aren't biological parents, and how it can alleviate the pressures of raising children in a country that lacks structural support for families.</p>

          <p>Today's New York Times Magazine cover story explores the influence of siblings on each other, often as significant as parental influence. The article references Susan Dominus's upcoming book, "The Family Dynamic", and highlights that the sibling spillover effect is more powerful in disadvantaged families. Research also indicates that personality traits associated with birth order don't hold up in well-conducted studies. The research suggests that parents are sometimes poor judges of their own children, affecting their development, and that genes versus environment is too simplistic a binary.</p>

          <h2>How UCLA's Andy Hill Spawned the Plus-Minus Stat, an Ode to Team Play and John Wooden</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Andy Hill, a former UCLA basketball player under John Wooden, created the plus-minus stat, now widely used in basketball to measure a player's impact on the team's score while on the court. Hill developed the concept in 1976 while coaching at Santa Monica College, seeking a way to reward players who contributed to winning beyond scoring. Coaches such as Mick Cronin and Lakers coach JJ Redick use plus-minus to assess player performance, though some, like Ken Pomeroy, caution against overreliance on the stat. Hill credits his concept to Wooden's emphasis on teamwork and doing the little things right.</p>
