          <p>The government of Congo and the M23 rebel group, which is backed by Rwanda, have signed a declaration of principles in Qatar aimed at ending their long-running conflict. This agreement commits both sides to a permanent ceasefire and outlines a plan to sign a comprehensive peace deal by mid-August. The conflict in eastern Congo has led to one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises, displacing seven million people. Key unresolved issues include the withdrawal of rebels from seized cities and the cessation of Rwandan support for the M23 group.</p>

          <h2>Charities Advocate for Council Tax Exemption for Terminally Ill Individuals in the UK</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:06:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two leading end-of-life charities in the UK, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for local councils to exempt people with a terminal diagnosis of less than 12 months from paying council tax. This campaign follows a pioneering move by Manchester City Council, which recently became the first authority to implement such a policy. Proponents argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a significant income shock while increasing costs, such as for energy to run medical devices. Exempting households from this major bill would provide crucial financial and emotional relief during an incredibly difficult time.</p>

          <p>Conservationists have successfully confirmed the breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years, thanks to the use of artificial intelligence. After reintroducing frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula, scientists used a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings from the relocation sites. The AI detected the distinct mating calls of mature male frogs, which had been pushed out of the state decades ago due to habitat loss and other pressures. This technological breakthrough marks a significant milestone in the effort to restore the threatened species.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-protein snacks flood the market, nutrition experts advise consumers to look beyond marketing claims. Many products labeled as "high-protein" may also contain significant amounts of sugar or be highly processed. Experts suggest a simple calculation to assess protein quality: multiply the grams of protein by four and divide by the total calories to see the percentage of calories from protein, with 30% or more being a good benchmark. They also recommend prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, or cottage cheese, which provide protein along with other essential nutrients without excessive additives.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch is rerecording its most popular songs after discovering their former label, Prospect Park, sold the master recordings to their first seven albums without their knowledge. Inspired by Taylor Swift's successful rerecording strategy, the band decided to reclaim their work, releasing the first collection titled "20 Years of Five Finger Death Punch — Best of Volume 1." Guitarist and founder Zoltan Bathory expressed frustration at not being given an option to buy the masters themselves but sees the project as a strategic move to regain control over their musical legacy.</p>

This move is part of a broader strategy by Nestlé to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee. By innovating in the cold and customizable coffee space, Nescafé aims to shift its brand perception from a hot, morning-only drink to an all-day beverage, even positioning it as a sophisticated alternative to alcohol.</p>

          <p>To help people avoid impulsive or emotionally-driven purchases, financial therapists suggest asking a series of self-reflective questions before buying something. Key considerations include whether the purchase fits within your budget without drawing from essential funds and whether it's an attempt to fill an emotional need, such as hunger, anger, or loneliness. Consumers are also encouraged to research products to ensure quality and value, rather than assuming price equals performance. By being more intentional and aware of the motivations behind spending, individuals can make more mindful financial decisions.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being celebrated by many Muslim and South Asian Americans as a sign of a new era in political representation. His campaign, which focused on affordability and Palestinian rights, resonated with a diverse coalition of voters, including working-class South Asians and Indo-Caribbeans. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen as a hopeful moment in a city with a history of post-9/11 surveillance of Muslim communities.

          <p>A team of Chinese medical researchers has developed a new, more affordable method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious diseases. Instead of producing the therapeutic cells in a lab, this new technique uses gene therapy tools to generate the anticancer cells directly inside the patient's body. The approach is reportedly easier to program and available at a fraction of the conventional cost, which can exceed $139,000 per treatment. The team has successfully used this method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma, a common blood cancer.</p>
