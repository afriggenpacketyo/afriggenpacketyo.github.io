          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform that has expanded into crypto, has priced its IPO at $52 per share, raising nearly $310 million and valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. The company's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will indicate the public market's appetite for risk following a period of tariff uncertainty that previously stalled IPO plans. BlackRock has expressed interest in purchasing $100 million in shares at the IPO price, and the funds will be used to expand the company's offerings and grow the userbase. Revenue from crypto assets has more than tripled in 2024, demonstrating the growing significance of the company's crypto business. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage demand from homebuyers has increased for the second consecutive week, driven by a rise in available homes for sale despite economic uncertainty and concerns over tariffs. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, total mortgage application volume rose 1.1% last week, with purchase applications increasing by 2% and 18% higher than the previous year. This suggests that potential buyers are more motivated by the growing supply of homes than deterred by higher interest rates, which averaged 6.86% for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The increase in home inventory is supporting more transactions, providing additional properties for buyers.</p>

The company is gradually restoring its systems in a safe and controlled manner and is working with suppliers to restock both in-store and online. Experts caution that the cyber-attack will have lasting reputational and financial effects on the Co-op, requiring ongoing investment in security systems and efforts to rebuild customer trust.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is set to eliminate out-of-pocket payments associated with child delivery, possibly from April 2026, to address the country's declining birthrate. The policy, approved by a panel of experts, involves fully covering expenses for normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes normal childbirth as it is not considered a medical condition. If childbirth becomes qualified for public coverage, a unified price will be set nationwide, though obstetricians have expressed concerns about the financial strain on medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>
