          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 12:22:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent New York Federal Reserve survey indicates that Americans' concerns about inflation diminished in May after President Trump softened some of his tariff proposals. The one-year inflation outlook dropped by 0.4 percentage points to 3.2%, while the three-year outlook fell to 3%. Despite remaining above the Fed's 2% target, these figures suggest a positive shift in sentiment, possibly influenced by Trump's revised tariff approach which included a 90-day negotiation window. The survey also revealed improved employment expectations and increased confidence in the stock market, painting a more optimistic economic picture. (not investment advice)</p>

Farage explained that Yusuf "lost his rag" but regretted his comments the following morning, prompting Farage to forgive him. Yusuf will now lead the party's Doge unit, inspired by US initiatives to cut wasteful spending in councils controlled by Reform.</p>
