          <p>Australians cast their votes in a general election amidst a backdrop of economic challenges and evolving geopolitical dynamics. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite Australia's historical reputation as a recession-proof nation. While the Labor Party, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, is projected to secure a second term, there's a noticeable shift towards independent candidates and minor parties, reflecting dissatisfaction with the major parties' approaches to addressing pressing issues. The article also touches on cultural divides and the influence of global politics, including comparisons to Trumpian policies, on the Australian political scene.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tim Friede, a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has aided scientists in developing an "unparalleled" antivenom. Antibodies in Friede's blood have shown the ability to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. This work could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom, potentially saving up to 140,000 lives annually and preventing numerous amputations and disabilities caused by snakebites. The research identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies capable of targeting two classes of neurotoxins, offering hope for a more effective treatment for snakebite victims worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the strength of the Hong Kong dollar, which had risen above its trading band against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA stated it will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative "revolution" led by party chief To Lam, aimed at modernizing the state, jumpstarting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms include trimming bureaucracy, reorganizing state agencies, and eliminating around 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes also address dysfunction created by the party's anti-corruption campaign and aim to strengthen political governance in the face of external pressures such as potential US tariffs. The restructuring is also seen as a power play by To Lam ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>
