          <p>The Office for Students (OfS) in England has issued guidance to universities emphasizing the importance of upholding free speech on campuses, even if it means exposing students to views they may find shocking or offensive. Arif Ahmed, from the OfS, stated that such exposure is part of the educational process, as a new law designed to protect free speech comes into effect in August. The guidance covers various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, and aims to ensure that universities do not penalize academics or students for expressing their opinions, as long as they do not violate the law.</p>

          <p>Democrats are becoming increasingly focused on politics, while many voters are more interested in other activities, creating a disconnect. The author argues that Democrats need to reconnect with these voters by demonstrating interests outside of politics, citing examples of past presidents who successfully balanced their political roles with personal hobbies. The party needs to build audiences through entertainment and then occasionally bring on candidates as guests, drawing inspiration from non-political figures who have gained credibility through their hobbies. To be successful, Democrats should take a page from those who focus first on interests, then issues, and only years later turn to elections.</p>
