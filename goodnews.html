          <p>The Republican-led House passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," critical to advancing President Trump's tax and immigration agenda, by a single vote. The bill includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending. The bill now goes to the Senate, where revisions are expected. The bill's passage comes after weeks of internal GOP wrangling and includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and the SALT deduction.</p>
