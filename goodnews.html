          <p>World No. 1 Jannik Sinner secured a swift victory against Alexander Bublik in the fourth round of the US Open, marking his quickest win in a Grand Slam match. The match, lasting only an hour and 21 minutes, ended with a decisive 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 score. This dominant performance extends Sinner's winning streak at hard-court Grand Slams to 25 matches and sets up the tournament's first-ever all-Italian men's quarter-final, where he will face Lorenzo Musetti.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House of Representatives, has announced that he will not seek reelection in 2026. In an interview with The New York Times, the 78-year-old Democrat cited the "necessity for generational change in the party" as a primary reason for his decision. Nadler, who was first elected in 1992 and previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee, stated that he believes a younger successor could better serve the party's interests.</p>

          <p>A new study published in *Earth and Planetary Science Letters* suggests that major geological events, like mass extinctions, are not random but follow a complex, multifractal pattern. Researchers analyzed the Phanerozoic Eon and found that catastrophic events occur in hierarchical clusters separated by long periods of calm. This discovery could improve models for predicting future planetary changes by revealing a deeper, structured logic to how Earth's systems evolve over vast timescales.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit alleging the government was bypassing legal protections for minors seeking humanitarian aid. The Justice Department stated 76 children were scheduled for removal before the judge's 14-day restraining order halted the process.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating, places the skull in the Middle Pleistocene era and strengthens the theory that it belongs to *Homo heidelbergensis*. The findings suggest this more primitive human species coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of the human family tree.</p>
