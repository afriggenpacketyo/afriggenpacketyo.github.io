        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence tools to improve their online dating prospects. Apps like Rizz and Keepler function as AI-powered "wingmen," helping users craft witty messages, navigate conversations, and even handle difficult situations like ghosting. While these services can boost confidence for those who struggle with writing, their rising popularity raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest the technology is useful as a supplement to human connection but caution against it becoming a substitute.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached the Wimbledon final, marking a remarkable comeback after taking an extended break from the sport in 2023 to address her mental health and burnout. Once a teenage prodigy, the 23-year-old stepped away from the tour, stating it had become "unbearable," and focused on living a normal life. Her successful return to the top of the sport, culminating in her first Grand Slam final appearance, is being hailed as an inspiring example of prioritizing personal well-being in a high-pressure professional environment.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high, briefly topping $118,000 before settling slightly lower. This significant rally is being fueled by a massive influx of institutional investment, with Bitcoin ETFs recording their largest single day of inflows for the year at $1.18 billion. The market's bullish sentiment is also supported by expectations that the next Federal Reserve leadership will adopt a more dovish stance on interest rates, which is often seen as a positive catalyst for alternative assets like cryptocurrency.

          <p>Fast bowler Jofra Archer made a triumphant return to England's Test cricket team after an absence of more than four years due to injury. In his first match back, playing against India at Lord's, he made an immediate impact, taking the key wicket of Yashasvi Jaiswal with just his third delivery, which reached speeds of 90mph. His exhilarating performance, marked by raw pace and hostility, has been celebrated as a significant boost for the England squad, demonstrating that he can still perform at the highest level after a long and difficult recovery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from press rights organizations, which argued that reporters were being deliberately targeted and injured while exercising their First Amendment rights. The judge cited clear evidence, including video of an officer appearing to aim at a reporter, in his decision to grant the injunction and protect media members from harm.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant deviation from the trend of swelling deficits. The Treasury Department reported that a primary driver for this unexpected surplus was a sharp increase in receipts, which were substantially boosted by a 301% year-over-year surge in customs duties from new tariffs. Despite this monthly positive, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains high at $1.34 trillion, and the cost of servicing the national debt continues to be a major expense. (not investment advice)</p>
