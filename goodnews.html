          <p>Broadcom's second-quarter results exceeded expectations, driven by strong growth in its AI business, leading to an increased price target despite a slight dip in after-hours trading. Revenue increased by 20% year-over-year to $15 billion, with adjusted earnings per share rising 44% to $1.58. CEO Hock Tan anticipates continued robust growth in AI revenue into fiscal year 2026, fueled by custom AI chips and networking solutions. The company is benefiting from its VMware acquisition, transitioning customers to subscription-based accounts, and returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that anti-discrimination laws apply equally to all employees, regardless of whether they are white or Black, gay or straight. The justices rejected the view that "members of a majority group" must show more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a discrimination lawsuit brought by a heterosexual woman who said she was discriminated against by a lesbian supervisor. The decision clarifies that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits workplace discrimination against "any individual."</p>
