          <p>SoftBank Group's shares experienced a significant surge, closing over 10% higher and reaching a record high following a fiscal first-quarter profit that greatly surpassed expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark reversal from the previous year's loss and well above analysts' consensus estimates. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, attributed to successful investments in companies like Grab and Swiggy. While some analysts are optimistic about its AI-focused strategy, others caution that the company's shares may be overvalued due to the market's high valuation of its subsidiary, Arm Holdings.

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistaking a team of charity rowers for "illegal migrants" off the coast of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Lowe posted on social media about a "dinghy" arriving, stating he had alerted authorities and would seek deportation if they were migrants. It was later confirmed by the HM Coastguard that the boat was carrying a crew raising money for Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research. After realizing his error, Lowe pledged to donate £1,000 to their charity, while the rowing team, which includes a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious" and noted it brought more attention to their fundraising efforts.</p>

          <p>The recent integration of Paralympic events into the US Track and Field Outdoor Championships marks a symbolic step towards equity, but questions remain about whether the U.S. is sufficiently investing in its para-athletes ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Paralympics. For years, para-athletes have competed in substandard venues and faced significant pay disparities compared to their Olympic counterparts. While some progress has been made, including equal medal bonuses, advocates argue that more funding and a better talent development pipeline are needed to compete with nations like China and Brazil. The formal merger of the para and able-bodied track programs is a positive development, but sustained commitment is required for future success.</p>

          <p>First-term Republican Senator Eric Schmitt of Missouri has emerged as a crucial ally for President Trump's agenda in the U.S. Senate. He recently played a pivotal role in advancing the president's effort to claw back billions in federal spending, including funds for NPR, PBS, and foreign aid. Schmitt, who was elected in 2022 with Trump's endorsement, has developed a close relationship with the president and is seen as an effective envoy for the White House in the upper chamber. His colleagues credit his negotiating skills and understanding of the America First message for successfully navigating the complex legislative process and uniting the Senate GOP behind the president's initiatives.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs has become a focal point of two high-profile lawsuits between Harvard University and the Trump administration, drawing public criticism from the president. Appointed by Barack Obama in 2014, Burroughs has a long and varied legal career as both a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney. Known for her direct and sometimes humorous courtroom demeanor, she has presided over several major cases, including one that led to the Supreme Court's decision on affirmative action. She is currently hearing cases concerning the administration's freezing of Harvard's federal research funding and its ban on international students, with her decisions expected in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to fast-track its plans to deploy a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030, aiming to power a future human base. Officials state that nuclear power is essential for long-term lunar occupation, as solar power is insufficient during the two-week lunar night. The plan is part of a broader goal to assert U.S. leadership in space amid similar ambitions from China and Russia. However, the ambitious timeline and estimated $3 billion cost raise concerns within the scientific community, especially given recent budget cuts and workforce reductions at NASA. Experts also note the technical challenges and safety considerations of launching and operating a nuclear reactor in space.</p>

          <p>Beijing is deepening its economic engagement with eSwatini, the last African nation to maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, by funding a major infrastructure project. A subsidiary of the state-owned enterprise PowerChina is constructing the US$146 million Mpakeni Dam, which will provide significant irrigation capabilities for the country. This project marks the first major engineering contract in eSwatini signed by a mainland Chinese enterprise. The move highlights China's strategy of using economic partnerships to build influence, even with countries that have not formally switched their diplomatic allegiance from Taipei to Beijing.</p>

          <p>A unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers" are providing researchers with valuable insights into resisting cognitive decline. These people, aged 80 and older, possess the memory capabilities of individuals who are decades younger, and their brains shrink at a much slower rate than their peers. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been studying this group for over two decades to uncover the secrets behind their remarkable brain health. A recent article summarizes their findings, offering clues as to how some brains can successfully fend off the effects of aging and diseases like Alzheimer's, which could inform future strategies for promoting healthy aging.</p>

          <p>The market for space company Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed signs of life after a recent lull, with several firms successfully going public this year. Companies like Karman Holdings, Voyager Technologies, and Firefly Aerospace have all had strong market debuts, signaling growing investor appetite for the sector. This trend marks a shift away from the SPAC mergers that were previously popular for taking space companies public. Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the alignment of space companies with national priorities and innovation makes them attractive investments, though they warn of increasing competition and potential supply chain vulnerabilities.
