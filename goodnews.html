          <p>While hummingbird feeders can supplement the diet of these birds, they can also be harmful if not properly cleaned. Spoiled sugar water attracts microbes that can cause infections in hummingbirds, such as candida. Wildlife rehabbers report that many hummingbirds require rescue due to feeder-related infections. To maintain a healthy feeder, it should be cleaned every two to three days with hot water, or with a vinegar and water mixture if mold is present, and filled with a solution of one part refined white sugar to four parts water.</p>
