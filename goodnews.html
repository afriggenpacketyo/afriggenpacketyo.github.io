          <p>Rupert Murdoch's family has reached a deal on the succession of his media empire, ensuring Lachlan Murdoch will take control of Fox News and the Wall Street Journal. The agreement resolves litigation among siblings who contested Murdoch's initial plan to install Lachlan as sole successor, with Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch ceasing their holdings in exchange for cash. The settlement is valued at $3.3 billion, to be split among the three siblings, with new trusts established for Lachlan and Rupert's younger daughters. This succession solidifies the conservative direction of Fox News. The article highlights the power dynamics within the Murdoch family and the future of the media empire. </p>

          <p>New league tables rating the performance of NHS trusts in England have been published, with specialist hospitals topping the list and Queen Elizabeth Hospital at the bottom. The tables aim to identify areas where urgent support is needed, allowing the public to check the performance of their local health services. While the Department of Health plans to offer greater freedom to top-performing trusts and enhanced support to struggling ones, concerns have been raised about the accuracy and potential unintended consequences of the rankings.
