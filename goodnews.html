          <h2>France Faces Fiscal Challenges Compared to Italy</h2>

          <p>France is facing increased scrutiny as its political instability and economic challenges are drawing unfavorable comparisons to Italy. France's debt and deficit figures are raising concerns among economists, particularly as Prime Minister Bayrou seeks to pass a contentious budget with significant cuts. The confidence vote on the budget is seen as an existential moment for France, with potential government collapse looming. Unlike Italy, which has found stability under Prime Minister Meloni, France's political turmoil is creating uncertainty and market nervousness. The yield on France's 30-year bond has risen, reflecting wider fiscal concerns.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose, tracking a tech rally on Wall Street, although economic concerns continue to weigh on equities. Japan's Nikkei 225 increased, driven by gains in domestic tech stocks, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed following positive household spending data. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed course and fell, and mainland China's CSI 300 also retreated. Global bond markets remain in focus, with long-dated borrowing costs under pressure. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield nudged above 5% after a court ruling on Trump's tariffs, raising questions about tariff revenues. Japan's 30-year bond yield reached a record high due to inflation and political uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martha's rule, which allows families to seek an urgent second opinion if concerned about a loved one's care, is being implemented in all acute hospitals in England. The initiative, spurred by the death of 13-year-old Martha Mills due to care failings, has been piloted in 143 hospitals since April 2024. Data from NHS England shows nearly 5,000 calls resulted in 241 potentially life-saving interventions. Martha's mother, Merope Mills, advocates for UK-wide access and highlights the need for improved doctor-patient relationships, with the expansion promising to save more lives.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, is under scrutiny after reports emerged that she saved £40,000 in stamp duty on her East Sussex flat. She claims she acted on expert advice but has since learned that arrangements involving her family home meant she should have paid a higher rate. Rayner has contacted HMRC to resolve the tax issue and referred herself for investigation by the prime minister's standards adviser. While mistakes were made, some believe she acted in good faith by consulting legal advice, while others call for her resignation. The investigation will determine whether Rayner took enough precautions when making the purchase.</p>

This jackpot is the third-biggest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the $2.04 billion and $1.765 billion jackpots won in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, with drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. The upcoming drawing will be the 42nd since the last Powerball jackpot was won on May 31, tying the game's record for consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he is seriously considering stripping actress Rosie O’Donnell of her U.S. citizenship, despite the Constitution not allowing it for those born in the U.S. Trump has made similar statements before, citing O’Donnell as "not in the best interests of our Great Country." O’Donnell, who has Irish grandparents, moved to Ireland with her daughter and is seeking Irish citizenship. The feud between Trump and O’Donnell dates back to 2006, with Trump often using derogatory terms to describe her. The article also mentions a recent apology from O'Donnell for incorrectly attributing a shooting to a MAGA supporter.</p>

          <p>Experts have determined that the Sycamore Gap tree, illegally felled in September 2023, was at least 100 to 120 years old. Historic England researchers counted the tree's rings in a cross-section of the trunk, narrowing down its age range. The tree was believed to have been planted between 1860 and 1890 by landowner John Clayton. Two men from Cumbria were jailed for cutting down the tree, sparking global outrage. The wood section will be preserved for further analysis, including advanced imaging techniques, to provide a more accurate count.</p>
