          <p>National Guard troops are slated to arrive in New Orleans by late November, extending their presence through New Year's Eve and Mardi Gras. New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick confirmed the deployment, emphasizing it as a partnership to support an understaffed police department, not a takeover. The assistance, requested by Governor Jeff Landry, aims to bolster security for major city events like the Bayou Classic. While crime rates are down compared to last year, the police department still requires approximately 300 more officers, making the Guard a crucial force multiplier for public safety.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Overall Exports Rebound in September, But US Shipments Decline Persists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:42:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a 4.2% year-on-year rebound in September, breaking a four-month decline, primarily driven by robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to fall by 13.3%, with auto shipments particularly impacted despite a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth. The data follows the appointment of Japan's first female Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, whose loose monetary and massive fiscal stimulus policies are expected to weaken the yen, potentially benefiting exporters and the Nikkei 225 index.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is set to close Terminal 5 on October 28 for a complete demolition and overhaul, part of a $30-billion renovation project leading up to the 2028 Olympics. This extensive upgrade aims to deliver a "brand new terminal and airport experience," improving efficiency and passenger flow. Airlines previously housed in Terminal 5 are being relocated, with JetBlue moving to Terminal 1, Spirit to Terminal 2, and American Airlines to Terminal 4. A new Midfield Satellite Concourse South has also opened, adding capacity and gates to help manage operations during the multi-year construction, which is expected to conclude just before the Olympic games.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner expressed optimism regarding the U.S.-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire plan, despite recent violence. Vance stated the plan is progressing "better than I expected," acknowledging the inherent difficulties in securing peace between long-standing adversaries. Efforts include the return of deceased hostages, with Israel identifying two more bodies. While the long-term viability remains uncertain, Vance emphasized a need for patience and flexibility, particularly regarding Hamas's disarmament, and confirmed no American troops would be deployed in Gaza. This article highlights the fragile nature of peace negotiations but also the commitment of US officials to the process.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier." The plan introduces automatic financial penalties up to £20,000 for minor offenses and simplifies punishment for more serious breaches by reducing the burden of proof. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the aim is to give the Environment Agency "teeth" to tackle rule-breaking, expecting to raise £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers. Critics, however, argue that even higher penalties and wholesale reform are needed to truly deter negligent firms from polluting rivers and short-changing customers.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Four Common Myths About Hair Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker debunk four common haircare myths, emphasizing that true hair health relies on basic care rather than expensive products or complex routines. They clarify that cold water doesn't enhance shine, and no product can repair damaged hair or split ends, which ultimately require a haircut. Furthermore, the notion of hair "self-cleaning" is false, as regular washing is essential to prevent oil and bacteria buildup. Dry shampoo is acceptable for occasional use but not as a substitute for washing, as overuse can lead to itchy and flaky scalp issues, underscoring the importance of proper hygiene.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study by King's College London and the University of Oxford has produced the first league table ranking the physical side effects of 30 different antidepressants. The research, involving over 58,500 patients, revealed significant variations in effects like weight gain/loss, heart rate, and blood pressure during the first eight weeks of treatment. Academics emphasize that these differences are clinically important and call for antidepressants to be closely matched to individual patient needs and health conditions. This initiative aims to improve treatment efficacy and patient adherence, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to mental health care, potentially benefiting millions.</p>
