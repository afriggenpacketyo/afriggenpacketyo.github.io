          <p>Electronic Arts (EA) stock experienced a significant 15% increase following a Wall Street Journal report that the video game giant is nearing a deal to be taken private. The potential acquisition, valued at approximately $50 billion, involves investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake. If finalized, this leveraged buyout would become the largest in Wall Street history, surpassing the 2007 deal for TXU Energy. EA, known for popular franchises like Madden NFL and The Sims, has seen its stock rise 32% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has restored the party whip to former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum, ending their year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs suspended after voting against the government's two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. This move follows the reinstatement of four other MPs from the same group seven months ago and comes amid growing pressure within the party to abolish the controversial cap. The policy is expected to be a major topic at the upcoming Labour conference.</p>

          <p>In an interview on the YouTube show "House Guest," Vice President Kamala Harris shared details about the day she learned President Biden would not seek reelection, effectively launching her own presidential campaign. She recalled the moment happening unexpectedly during a casual family pizza night, which quickly transformed into a campaign strategy session. Harris also discussed her forthcoming book, "107 Days," reflecting on the emotional toll of conceding the election, which she compared to the grief she felt after her mother's death.

She explained that her relationships, including her 26-year marriage to the late Eddie Van Halen, began more organically without a formal invitation. Bertinelli recounted meeting Van Halen backstage at a concert, after which they were inseparable and married eight months later. She has since been outspoken about the emotional abuse she endured in her second marriage to Tom Vitale, which ended in 2022.</p>

          <p>Sinclair Broadcasting has announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemption that began after host Jimmy Kimmel made controversial remarks about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The late-night show, which returned to the main ABC network after a six-day suspension, had remained off the air on stations owned by Sinclair and Nexstar. In a statement, Sinclair emphasized its commitment to providing programming that serves community interests while honoring network obligations. Nexstar has not yet announced its decision regarding the show.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Opening a CD in Early October to Secure Higher Rates Before Potential Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:41:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers to consider opening a certificate of deposit (CD) in early October to lock in currently attractive interest rates. With the Federal Reserve having already cut rates and a high probability of another reduction at the end of the month, banks may preemptively lower their CD yields. Acting quickly allows savers to begin compounding interest immediately at a fixed rate of around 4.50% before rates potentially fall further. Waiting is unlikely to offer any advantages, as banks often adjust their rates in anticipation of Fed policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

The FAA stated that it and Boeing will now issue the safety certificates on alternating weeks, a move indicating renewed confidence in the manufacturer's quality control. However, the agency will maintain its production cap on the 737 MAX, which was implemented after a midair incident in January 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments on a new home equity loan have become slightly more affordable. A $150,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term now averages around $1,847 per month, while a 15-year term averages about $1,452 per month. These costs are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, potentially saving borrowers around $1,900 over a decade. With more rate cuts anticipated, homeowners may find home equity a more attractive borrowing option, though careful calculation remains essential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco reported solid fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, though the results were not entirely perfect, leading to a slight dip in its stock price. The company's comparable sales grew by 5.7%, just missing the 5.9% estimate, and membership renewal rates saw a minor decline. Despite these misses, analysts highlighted strong points, including a 14% growth in membership fee income and impressive traffic, particularly given the challenging retail environment.

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils to Indonesia, including parts of the historic "Java Man." These fossils, the first known remains of the human ancestor Homo erectus, were excavated in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois when Indonesia was a Dutch colony. The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of the Netherlands' ongoing efforts to reckon with its colonial past and return cultural artifacts.</p>

In a separate operation, the Cutter Diligence seized 8,700 pounds of the narcotic north of Panama.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy gaining traction as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. This approach involves converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and emergencies. The strategy aims to balance financial security with flexibility, reducing stress from market volatility while potentially allowing for higher overall spending in early retirement.
