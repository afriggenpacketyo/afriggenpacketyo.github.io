          <p>San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey is listed as questionable for the season opener due to a calf issue, raising concerns among fans given his injury history. McCaffrey, however, expressed confidence to reporters, stating he feels "great" and plans to play against the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. This situation mirrors last season when a similar injury concern led to him being placed on injured reserve, but he insists this time is different and that missing practice was a precautionary measure.</p>

The ruling states that the Department of Homeland Security's decision to revoke their protected status was unlawful, especially since conditions in their home countries remain dangerous. This decision allows approximately 1.1 million people to continue living and working legally in the U.S., though the DHS has indicated it will appeal.</p>

A key new provision aims to prevent traditional securities, like stocks, from being regulated as commodities if they are converted into tokenized digital assets. The bill, championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, seeks to establish clear regulatory boundaries between the SEC and CFTC for digital assets and is hoped to be passed by the end of the year.

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, winners face a critical decision between taking a lump sum or receiving annual payments. A certified public accountant advises that while the lump sum offers investment control, it can be "dangerous" for those unaccustomed to managing vast wealth, noting many past winners have gone bankrupt. The annuity option is presented as a "safe bet" that makes it harder to overspend, though the net payout after taxes is significantly reduced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a formal designation for countries that wrongfully detain U.S. nationals, enabling the U.S. to impose punitive measures. This new policy provides the State Department with tools such as sanctions and travel restrictions to penalize nations that use American citizens as political leverage. The move is aimed at deterring hostage-taking and securing the release of Americans currently held abroad, and it has been praised by families of former detainees.</p>
