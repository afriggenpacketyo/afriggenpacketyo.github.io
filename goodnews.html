          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has contradicted Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s statement that COVID-19 vaccines would no longer appear on the childhood immunization schedule. The CDC maintains its advice that children may receive COVID-19 shots. This update counters Kennedy's policy, which had suggested a shift in the government's stance on the necessity of COVID-19 vaccination for children.</p>
