          <p>Washington officials expressed optimism following two-day trade negotiations with China in Geneva, with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promising a briefing on the outcome. The talks aimed to de-escalate tensions between the world's two largest economies after Trump imposed significant tariffs on China, which were met with retaliatory tariffs on US goods. The negotiations occur amid numerous WTO complaints against Trump's tariff approach, with the US team citing "substantial progress" and an agreement reached quickly, suggesting differences were not as large as thought. London and Washington also announced a trade deal, though no final deal has been signed.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" on de-escalating the trade war as high-level talks wrapped in Geneva, Switzerland. The talks were the first meeting since US President Donald Trump levied steep tariffs against China in January, but Bessent did not elaborate on what had been agreed to, but said details would be announced on Monday and that Trump had been updated. Trump praised the talks for engendering a "total reset" on the relationship between the two countries. The US has tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, and China retaliated with levies of 125% on some US goods.</p>

Harry‚Äôs emotional plea, made in a recent interview, resurfaced bitter ruptures within the royal family, which has yet to find its footing in the still-fledgling Carolean era. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal that rift, it could define his reign, undercutting the messages of tolerance and inclusiveness that he has long championed. The King‚Äôs younger brother, Prince Andrew, is still in internal exile, following the scandal over his ties to the disgraced sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

The joke was not only that a waiter would take things so far in flirting with the mothers, but that it was ridiculous that a guy like him could truly be hot for these silly, frumpy old moms. In a segment of ‚ÄúWeekend Update,‚Äù SNL reinforced the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality.</p>
