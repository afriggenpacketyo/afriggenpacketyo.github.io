          <p>Australians are voting in a general election where the rising cost of living and housing shortages are key issues. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeks a second term, while Peter Dutton's conservative coalition aims to unseat the first-term government, something not done since 1931. Early voting has been significant, with 8.6 million ballots already cast. Both parties have focused on addressing housing affordability and energy policy, with the opposition proposing nuclear power plants and Labor prioritizing renewable energy sources. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange endorsed Albanese, praising his efforts to secure his freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. The judge found that the order, which sought to penalize the firm for representing Hillary Clinton and its progressive employment policies, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions, which the judge described as an "unprecedented attack" on the American judicial system. The firm represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous "Steele Dossier."</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese e-commerce platform, has stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, now fulfilling all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's closure of a loophole that allowed low-cost Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import fees. The company said that pricing for U.S. consumers remains unchanged and that it is actively recruiting U.S. sellers to join the platform. The move is intended to help local merchants reach more customers and grow their businesses.</p>

          <p>Wall Street stocks rebounded after experiencing losses following President Trump's tariff announcements. Major US indexes saw gains, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rising 1.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increasing 1.4%. Shares saw gains for the ninth day in a row for the first time since 2004 after a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hope of US-China trade talks. The Department of Labor reported that US employers added 177,000 new jobs in April, surpassing analysts' predictions. China is considering an offer from Washington to hold trade talks with the US.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's dismissal of nearly 400 scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, two scientific groups, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, plan to publish a special collection of climate research. This effort aims to ensure that the scientists' work is accessible, given concerns that the next National Climate Assessment may be less extensive. The groups are inviting climate scientists and researchers to submit their work for this collection, which will complement the official assessment. The goal is to support solutions to climate change.</p>

M&S has reassured staff that they will be paid for all contracted hours. The cyber attack has forced Greencore to revert to manual systems, similar to how it operated 25 years ago.</p>

          <p>Fifteen-year-old Benjamin Qin Muji argued that artificial intelligence could indeed think and, therefore, was conscious, during the China trials for the International Philosophy Olympiad. Benjamin reasoned that AI, with its ability to process information and synthesize ideas, could think but could not feel pain because it lacked a biological body. His convincing reasoning earned him top place among over 70 competitors. Benjamin is part of a new generation grappling with the implications of AI, considering the legal aspects of conscious machines and the evolving definition of humanity.</p>

          <p>Andrea Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to take F1 pole in the Miami Grand Prix sprint race. Antonelli's impressive margin over Russell came despite the Briton joining Verstappen in being the only driver to use two sets of tires over two runs in the final session. Verstappen, who arrived in Miami late following the birth of his first child, said: "What we did in Q3 was good, the tires are holding on quite well, but from P1 struggling with a lot of understeer in the car and with all the low-speed corners, you lose quite a bit of lap time."</p>
