          <p>A 12-year-old girl sustained serious, but non-life-threatening injuries after an alligator encounter at Lake Waccamaw in North Carolina. The incident occurred while the girl was swimming with other children in about four feet of water, prompting immediate removal of the children from the lake. Authorities responded, with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) noting the alligator, a 12-foot male, caused lacerations and scratches on the girl's legs. As per protocol, the alligator was euthanized following the incident, which the NCWRC deemed unusual and non-predatory, also reminding residents and visitors to remain vigilant around water and to maintain a safe distance from wildlife. The NCWRC also asked to be notified of large alligators that are spending time around a pier or in the lake in daylight hours, also any alligator that regularly approaches people or is exhibiting a general lack of fear or aggressive behavior.</p>

          <h2>New Emissions Guidance Affects North Sea Oil and Gas Projects</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for assessing applications for North Sea oil and gas projects, requiring operators to evaluate emissions from burning the extracted oil and gas, not just production emissions. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling and will impact the controversial Rosebank and Jackdaw fields, with fresh approval needed for extraction. While Energy Minister Michael Shanks asserts the guidance provides clarity for the industry's future, climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely reduce the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels. The government will consider economic impacts alongside environmental concerns, with decisions expected by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>The UK experienced its hottest day of the year, with temperatures exceeding 32C, leading to the declaration of a heatwave in Suffolk. Amber heat health alerts are in effect across England, with potential strain on health and social care services. The rising temperatures are attributed to high pressure and a south-easterly wind drawing hot air from Western Europe, and regional fire services have issued water safety warnings. A change in wind direction is expected to bring cooler temperatures by Sunday, and those with heart conditions and older adults are advised to take precautions.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling nearly 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal. The brake pedal pivot pin may not have been properly staked during production, which could cause the pedal to move side to side and affect braking. The recall affects Acura TLX models from 2021-2025, Acura MDX models from 2023-2025, and Honda Pilot models from 2023-2025, and owners will be contacted to have their brake pedals replaced if necessary. The issue originated at a U.S. plant that is no longer operational, and production has been moved to Mexico with improved quality control measures.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States, derives its name from the combination of the words "June" and "nineteenth."

Celebrations of Juneteenth include parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops, and the holiday serves as a reminder of the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.</p>

Greener options need to be simple and affordable, rather than another thing for people to worry about, and for many, the increase in their home electricity bills can be a concern when making the move to an EV. New options such as subscription models are key to more of us embracing EVs in a cost-effective way, with the launch of a new subscription offering that removes significant upfront costs of around ¬£1,000 to install a home charger. Not only does a subscription spread the initial cost outlay, but included in the offering is cashback to cover the costs of up to 7,500 miles of charging, that‚Äôs the average mileage UK drivers cover each year, helping to offset the increase to home electricity bills.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to continue working closely with South Korea at a ceremony in Tokyo to commemorate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties.
