        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the state-owned rail operator, has permanently abolished peak time rail fares effective September 1st, a move designed to make train travel more accessible and encourage a shift from private vehicles. This initiative, championed by the Scottish Greens and announced by First Minister John Swinney, will result in significant savings for many passengers, with some key routes, such as Edinburgh to Glasgow, seeing nearly 50% reductions. The decision follows a successful pilot scheme and is part of a broader strategy to simplify ticketing, enhance flexibility, and reduce carbon emissions across Scotland, aligning economic relief with environmental objectives. This policy aims to boost public transport ridership.</p>

          <p>Scientists have made a significant discovery, identifying ancient brine shrimp, or Artemia, in an exceptionally saline water source within China's Taklamakan Desert in Xinjiang. These crustaceans, known for their extreme salt tolerance and widespread use in aquaculture feed, as well as their medicinal and cosmetic value, could potentially be a new species. Researchers from Tarim University are now conducting laboratory studies to confirm this and to explore the necessary scientific and technical support for developing commercial aquaculture in the region. This discovery not only highlights the unique biodiversity of Xinjiang but also presents a promising new avenue for economic and scientific development.</p>

          <p>The GOP-led House Oversight Committee has officially withdrawn its subpoena for former special counsel Robert Mueller to testify regarding the Jeffrey Epstein files, citing his health issues. A committee spokesperson confirmed this, and Mueller's family later informed The New York Times that he is battling Parkinson's disease, which prevents him from appearing before Congress. Chairman James Comer had subpoenaed Mueller, who served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013, believing his knowledge from that period was relevant to the committee's investigation into Epstein. This withdrawal effectively concludes the committee's efforts to obtain his testimony on this sensitive issue.</p>

This strategic move, reported by Bloomberg News, could mark a major step in Asia for OpenAI's ambitious "Stargate" artificial intelligence infrastructure push. The company has already registered as a legal entity in India and plans to open its first local office in New Delhi this year, recognizing India as its second-largest market by user base. CEO Sam Altman might announce the facility during an upcoming visit, highlighting India's increasing role in global AI development and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holdings' Hong Kong-listed shares surged nearly 19% following better-than-expected June quarter results, primarily driven by accelerated sales in its cloud-computing unit and a continued revival of its e-commerce business. The company reported a substantial 78% increase in net income, largely due to gains from equity investments and the divestment of a Turkish e-commerce firm. Strong AI demand fueled the Cloud Intelligence Group, with AI-related product revenue sustaining triple-digit year-over-year growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. Despite significant investments in China's competitive "quick commerce" sector, investors are showing confidence in Alibaba's strategic focus on AI and international market expansion.

          <p>Football icon Wayne Rooney has asserted that the current season is a pivotal "now or never" moment for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, implying an expectation for him to secure major silverware. Rooney's remarks came after Arsenal's 1-0 loss to Liverpool, a game where he felt the Gunners displayed insufficient attacking bravery. Despite substantial investment in the squad under Arteta, Rooney still considers Liverpool the favorites for the Premier League title, citing their recent championship experience. He criticized Arsenal's conservative approach in high-stakes matches, suggesting they often prioritize avoiding defeat over aggressively pursuing victory, thereby missing key opportunities.</p>

The scheme, backed by £15m in funding over two financial years, has already garnered over 10,000 applications for the required mytravelpass.

          <p>Hong Kong-listed shares of BYD declined by nearly 8% after the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer reported a 30% drop in its second-quarter net profit, largely attributed to an aggressive price war within China's EV market. Despite a 14% year-over-year revenue increase, bolstered by expanding overseas sales, the fierce domestic competition severely affected the company's profitability. Chinese authorities have previously cautioned automakers against exacerbating price cuts, which have led to a substantial 19% decrease in retail car prices over the last two years. Nevertheless, BYD still recorded a 14% rise in first-half net profit and continues its robust expansion into global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

While gains in overall output and new orders were modest, suggesting persistent weak domestic demand, average raw material costs rose at their quickest pace in nine months.
