          <p>In an interview, IBM Vice Chairman and former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn analyzed the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut. He explained that while the Fed sets the overnight bank lending rate, this doesn't directly lower borrowing costs for consumers, which are tied to longer-term market rates. Cohn also discussed the cooling labor market, noting that companies are reducing labor costs to maintain profit margins amid rising input costs, a trend he sees across the board. He also commented positively on a new executive order imposing a significant fee for H-1B visas, suggesting it will ensure the program is used for genuinely high-skilled workers.

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker won the men's 5,000m gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the bell but unleashed a devastating kick to overtake his rivals, finishing in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided a sense of vindication for Hocker, who had been controversially disqualified from the 1500m event earlier in the championships for jostling. The final night also saw the US win both the men's and women's 4x100m relays.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the American team could face pressure from their own home crowd at Bethpage Black. He pointed to the controversial decision for US players to receive a $500,000 payment for participating, a stark contrast to the European team who play for free. Donald speculated that if the US team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might express their displeasure. He affirmed that the European players are motivated by purpose and the tradition of the event, not monetary rewards.</p>

          <p>In response to global concerns over aeronautical production quality, the assembly line for China's C919 passenger jet is being highlighted as a model of futuristic manufacturing. The facility operates as a "smart factory," integrating 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker in a unified system. This "sensing-transmission-control integration" aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts by creating a single, intelligent feedback loop for data collection, communication, and control.

          <p>In a recent interview, President Donald Trump suggested that media executive Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan are likely to be involved in the investment group forming a deal to manage TikTok's US operations. Trump mentioned Lachlan Murdoch by name and stated that Rupert would probably be part of the group as well. He also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other prominent American "patriots" likely participating in the deal. These comments come as the final details of the agreement, which aims to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese ownership, are being finalized.</p>

          <p>Rail travel is currently booming in the United States, with Amtrak experiencing a notable increase in ridership and public interest. The national railway firm has been actively promoting its services, including on social media platforms like TikTok, to highlight new investments and upgrades. A key example is the recent launch of the "next-gen" Acela train, which operates on the busy Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor. This development, along with others, signals a growing momentum and a potential shift towards more modern, European-style train services in America.</p>

          <p>In a landmark event showcasing decades of environmental progress, about 300 people participated in the first official, organized swim in the Chicago River in almost 100 years. Once a notoriously polluted waterway used as a dumping ground for industrial and sewage waste, the river has undergone a remarkable transformation thanks to the Clean Water Act and local cleanup efforts. The event, long championed by organizer Doug McConnell, symbolizes the city's renewed connection to its river, which now supports dozens of fish species and other wildlife.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, Wall Street strategists are optimistic that the stock market's record-breaking run may not be over. Some analysts believe the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks still have room to grow, powered by the artificial intelligence boom and strong productivity gains that justify higher valuations. Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors argues that today's S&P 500, with its high-growth tech orientation, is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks. However, other experts caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Elissa Epel, an expert on well-being and aging, chronic stress can significantly accelerate the aging process at a cellular level. Stress shortens telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, which naturally shrink with age but do so more rapidly under constant duress. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage is reversible through lifestyle changes that create an "anti-inflammatory" environment for cells. She recommends practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, incorporating Omega-3s into one's diet, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to help restore cells and slow down aging.</p>

Johnson explained that after years of focusing on box office success, he felt unfulfilled and desired a dramatic role he could "rip myself open" for. He admitted to being nervous about the part, which required him to tap into past personal traumas, such as being evicted as a teenager, to convey the character's despair.

          <p>Neath Port Talbot council in Wales has implemented a voluntary ban on the use of plastic flying rings on its beaches to prevent harm to the local seal population. The circular toys pose a significant danger to young, curious seals, who can get the rings stuck around their necks, leading to severe injury, infection, and often death. The council's action follows similar moves by other local authorities and retailers across the UK who have stopped selling the products.

          <p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl explains the holiday's central theme of "Teshuvah," or "return." She describes this period not just as a time for individual resolutions, but as a season of communal atonement where congregations collectively take an accounting of their shortcomings. This act of communal confession, she argues, carries a fundamentally hopeful message: that people and societies can change for the better by returning to their "better selves." Rabbi Buchdahl suggests that this concept could be applied on a national level to address societal failings with shared responsibility and a focus on compassion.</p>

Other crucial behaviors involve treating mistakes as learning opportunities, teaching how to repair after conflict, and listening more than lecturing, all of which build a foundation for emotional intelligence and strong real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>As annual fees for premium travel credit cards rise, credit expert Brian Kelly of The Points Guy advises consumers not to automatically opt for no-fee cards, as they generally offer poor rewards. He highlights three common mistakes: choosing a card that doesn't match one's lifestyle, hoarding points instead of redeeming them, and failing to negotiate with the card issuer. Kelly suggests that users with large, unspent point balances may have the wrong card and warns that points can be devalued at any time. He also recommends calling the credit card's retention department to ask for discounts or bonus points before deciding to cancel or downgrade a card.</p>

          <p>Genetic analysis of two 7,000-year-old mummies discovered in a Libyan rock shelter has revealed they belong to a previously unknown human lineage. The remains are of female herders who lived during the "Green Sahara" period when the region was a humid savannah. Researchers were surprised to find that their DNA did not show the expected Sub-Saharan genes, but instead indicated they were part of a distinct North African group that diverged from other lineages much earlier. This finding suggests that pastoralism and farming likely spread through the region via cultural exchange rather than large-scale migration and genetic mixing.</p>

By creating a chemical fingerprint from mineral grains within the stone, researchers have determined that it likely came from the Orcadian Basin in northeast Scotland, over 466 miles away. This contradicts previous research that pointed to a source in Wales.
