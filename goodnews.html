          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 00:04:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese exports, which notably lowers the duty on automobiles from 25%. The agreement is also expected to prompt a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and open Japanese markets to more American goods, including vehicles and agricultural products. This development provided a political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and caused a substantial surge in Japanese automaker stocks, with companies like Toyota and Honda seeing their shares climb significantly.

          <h2>Japanese and South Korean Automaker Stocks Surge as U.S. Reduces Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal, shares of major Japanese automakers like Toyota, Honda, and Nissan experienced a significant surge, some by over 15%. The positive market reaction was a direct response to the U.S. lowering its tariff on imported Japanese vehicles from 25% to 15%, a key component of the broader agreement. The reduction provides crucial relief for Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy that had seen exports to the U.S. decline under the higher tariffs, and also boosted shares for South Korean carmakers Hyundai and Kia.

Both the manager and general manager indicated that the 31-year-old's condition had improved, preserving hope that the injury is not season-ending and he can return to contribute to the team's late-season and postseason efforts.</p>

          <p>England's women's football team, the Lionesses, has reached a third consecutive major final after a dramatic and challenging run at Euro 2025.

Their journey culminated in a chaotic 2-1 extra-time semi-final victory over Italy, where they scored a last-minute equalizer and a late winner, showcasing what their manager Sarina Wiegman described as unbelievable resilience and togetherness.</p>
