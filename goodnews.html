          <p>Actress Barbara Stock, who played Liz Adams on the hit series "Dallas," shared her experience of discovering she was being written off the show without prior warning. She realized her time was up when a crew member mentioned it was her last day, a fact she should have guessed from a script that had her character packing a suitcase. Despite her initial heartbreak, Stock holds no resentment and has fond memories of the cast, including Larry Hagman and Patrick Duffy. She later transitioned from acting to interior design to spend more time with her family.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy shared his concerns about the current state of the high court, describing some of its opinions as "a little bit too personal and confrontational." Reflecting on his career and new memoir, the 89-year-old discussed his role as a "swing justice" in landmark cases involving abortion rights and same-sex marriage. He expressed worry that a lack of civility in public discourse is endangering democracy and hopes the court will "settle down" in its approach.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages and their release is anticipated within the next 24 hours. This development is seen as a significant step towards peace in the Middle East, with President Trump scheduled to visit Israel and Egypt to mark the occasion. While the U.S. is establishing a coordination center in Israel to monitor the ceasefire, Vance clarified that the deployed troops are to support logistics and are not intended for ground operations in Gaza. This marks a pivotal moment in ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The United States has a uniquely rich history of modern invention, from the light bulb to the internet, raising questions about the source of its innovative spirit. The article points to figures like Thomas Edison, who pioneered the "invention factory" model of collaborative creation, as a starting point. Investors from the show "Shark Tank" and author Steven Johnson attribute this success to a combination of factors, including a pioneering immigrant spirit, a financial ecosystem that supports risk-taking, and a culture that glamorizes entrepreneurship and is more tolerant of failure.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the ethical conflict of being a Harry Potter fan while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the column suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the text's problematic elements. This engagement, especially in a community, can transform a personal dilemma into a socially productive conversation.</p>
