          <p>ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, disclosed internal data showing the median service length for its current employees is approximately three years. This revelation came during a company town hall meeting and appears to counter online speculation of much shorter employee retention periods. With a workforce of around 120,000, the figures suggest a relatively stable employment environment compared to the high turnover often associated with China's tech industry. The company notably shifted away from the demanding "996" work culture in 2021.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has expressed optimism regarding recent trade negotiations with China, stating that the meetings in Stockholm have advanced the talks. In a social media post, the secretary indicated a belief that a beneficial deal for both nations is achievable, attributing the positive direction to the relationship between the U.S. and Chinese presidents. While China's vice-minister of commerce suggested an extension of the current pause on new tariffs, the Trump administration has not yet confirmed this. The U.S. side appears to be taking a measured approach before announcing any new agreements.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for over 60,000 individuals, whose legal status and protection from deportation were set to expire. The judge found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in arguing the administration's decision was "preordained" and possibly motivated by racial animus, citing controversial statements by the President. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling and has stated its intention to appeal.</p>

He reported receiving "unbelievable" interest from various rugby clubs and expects to finalize a team soon.

          <h2>Appeals Court Appears Skeptical of Trump's Order Restricting Birthright Citizenship</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has signaled it may rule against the Trump administration's executive order aimed at limiting birthright citizenship. During a hearing, judges on the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intensely questioned the Justice Department's argument that the 14th Amendment does not automatically grant citizenship to U.S.-born children of undocumented parents. This follows a similar ruling from the Ninth Circuit and multiple lower courts that have found the order unconstitutional. The case is widely expected to ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court, making it a pivotal legal battle over U.S. immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who were legally paroled into the U.S. on humanitarian grounds. The ruling could hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts, particularly an operation that involves arresting migrants at their court hearings for expedited removal. The judge noted the plaintiffs had "played by the rules" by entering with government permission and attending hearings, only to be targeted. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including many who entered under Biden-era policies, though the Justice Department is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, this article suggests several strategic moves for savers considering long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). It advises savers to determine the maximum amount they can lock away for an extended period to take advantage of currently high, fixed rates. The piece also recommends using this period of rate stability to shop around for the best offers, particularly from online banks which often provide higher returns. Finally, it encourages a re-evaluation of where other savings are held, as moving funds from low-yield traditional accounts into higher-earning CDs could be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article forecasts a period of relative stability for gold prices in August, after a year of significant increases. It suggests that several factors are contributing to a potential plateau around the current $3,300 per ounce mark. The Federal Reserve's decision to pause interest rate changes removes a major catalyst for price movement in either direction. Furthermore, with inflation readings and stock market performance sending mixed signals, the immediate demand for gold as a safe-haven asset may level off, leading to a period of price stagnation for the precious metal.

          <h2>EU Court Ruling Delivers Setback to Italy's Migrant Processing Deal with Albania</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's highest court has dealt a significant blow to Italy's plan to process asylum seekers in offshore centers in Albania. The European Court of Justice ruled that Italy's method for designating a migrant's home country as "safe" for return violates EU law. This "safe country" concept is central to the fast-track processing system Italy intended to implement. The court stated that a country can only be deemed safe if protection is guaranteed for its entire population, a standard Italy's current list does not meet. This decision effectively halts the controversial plan until Italy revises its laws to comply.</p>
