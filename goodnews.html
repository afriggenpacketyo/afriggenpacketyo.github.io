          <p>The first day of NBA free agency saw surprising moves, with Myles Turner leaving the Indiana Pacers to sign a four-year, $107 million deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the signing, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will now be a free agent. The article also details other significant league transactions, including Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's record-setting $285 million extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Additional moves involved Duncan Robinson heading to the Detroit Pistons and Dennis Schr√∂der joining the Sacramento Kings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of a major domestic policy bill proposed by the Trump administration includes a significant boost for the semiconductor industry, increasing tax credits for US-based chip manufacturing from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron to expand their advanced production facilities within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The legislation, which still needs to pass the House, reflects Washington's ongoing efforts to onshore the chip supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. Analysts suggest the threat of tariffs combined with these enhanced credits will likely accelerate domestic investment from major chipmakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As copper emerges as a critical mineral for the global green energy transition, China is strategically increasing its investments in Africa to secure its supply. Chinese companies are heavily funding mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia, and are now expanding their focus to Botswana. This move is driven by the essential role of copper in technologies like EVs and solar power, as well as by Western restrictions on Chinese access to mineral assets in other regions.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change to the company's contract manufacturing business, potentially moving away from a key strategy of his predecessor. The proposed shift involves no longer marketing its 18A chipmaking process, a technology that cost billions to develop, to new external customers. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process, where it believes it can better compete with rivals like TSMC for major clients such as Apple and Nvidia. This potential pivot is part of an effort to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker's fortunes. (not investment advice)</p>
