          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office, after which ownership would transfer to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. This arrangement, expected to be announced during Trump's visit to Qatar, raises legal questions about accepting such a valuable gift from a foreign power. Lawyers from the White House counsel's office and the DOJ have reportedly drafted an analysis concluding the gift is legal and does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution's emoluments clause. The plane would initially be transferred to the Air Force for modifications before being given to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities in Fort Lauderdale has sparked controversy, with some residents alleging racial motives. The basketball courts, popular among a diverse crowd, were built shortly after the end of segregation on the city's beaches. Critics fear that converting the courts to pickleball will destroy a community tradition and exclude minority residents who frequent the area. Developers argue that pickleball has broader appeal, while opponents claim the decision reflects an effort to attract a more affluent, less diverse demographic to the beach.</p>

          <p>After a century of upward climb, US life expectancy has recently declined, prompting scientists to seek ways to reverse this trend. Dr. Eric Topol suggests adopting evidence-based steps, including knowing and lowering one's biological age, eating a Mediterranean-style diet, sleeping more deeply, engaging in strength training, and fostering social connections. The article cites studies showing the benefits of these practices, such as improved cardiovascular health, reduced risk of neurodegenerative diseases, and decreased mortality rates.
