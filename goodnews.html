          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:31:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the 2002 hit film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is in development. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha stated that the recent success of women's football, particularly England's Lionesses, makes it an ideal time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast, including Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, for what could be another film or a television series.</p>

          <h2>New Wearable Sensor Wirelessly Monitors Hydration to Help Prevent Heatstroke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:17:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Texas have developed a non-invasive wearable sensor that continuously monitors a person's hydration levels. The device uses bioimpedance, sending a small electrical current through the arm to measure tissue hydration, and transmits the data to a smartphone. This technology could provide a real-time, accessible alternative to traditional methods like blood or urine tests. The creators believe it has significant potential for athletes, individuals with chronic health conditions, and anyone at risk of dehydration, especially in extreme heat.</p>

          <h2>India Shows Resilience on Day Four of Fourth Test Against England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:16:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance against England on the fourth day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, closing on 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a formidable total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined performance has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>The question of how much coffee is healthy remains complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends on the individual. Recent studies have linked daily coffee consumption to benefits like healthy aging and improved heart health, while others show risks for those with hypertension or potential links to dementia. Most health experts, including the FDA, recommend a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups of coffee. They stress the importance of moderation and being mindful of personal tolerance and effects on sleep or anxiety.</p>

Despite his age and initial reluctance, the surgery was a success, and at 75, his lung capacity is now at 98%.

          <p>As the Trump administration alters federal student loan programs, more employers are offering loan reimbursement as a workplace benefit. This trend is bolstered by a provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that makes up to $5,250 in annual employer contributions permanently tax-free. Companies like Nvidia and New York Life are using these programs to attract and retain talent, offering a financial lifeline to employees burdened by debt. This private-sector solution is becoming more critical for borrowers as federal options for repayment and forgiveness are narrowed. (not investment advice)</p>
