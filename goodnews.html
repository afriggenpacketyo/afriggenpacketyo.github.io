          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily allowed President Donald Trump to continue collecting import taxes, suspending a lower court's ruling that deemed many of his global tariffs illegal. The White House argued that the lower court's decision improperly interfered with the president's authority over trade negotiations. The ruling stems from a challenge by small businesses and states, who argue that the tariffs, imposed on goods from China, Mexico, and Canada, exceed presidential powers. The appeals court decision allows the tariffs to remain in effect while the case is litigated further.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have discovered evidence of a process called "sputtering" that could explain the history of water loss on Mars. Using data from the MAVEN mission, researchers found that charged particles knock atoms out of the Martian atmosphere, contributing to its thinning. This sputtering effect helps explain why Mars lost its once-thick atmosphere, leading to the escape of liquid water into space. The findings provide insights into the conditions that may have made Mars inhabitable billions of years ago, helping to recreate the planet's past environment.</p>
