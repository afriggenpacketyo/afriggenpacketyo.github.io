          <h2>Companies Skirt Tariffs Through 'Tariff Engineering' Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 23:15:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are creatively altering products to fit into lower-tariff categories, a practice known as "tariff engineering." This legal tactic involves modifying a product's materials or dimensions to qualify for a different harmonized system code, potentially saving companies significant amounts in duties. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum to qualify for lower duties, while others are removing those elements to ship them separately based on tariff changes. Columbia Sportswear adds small zippered pockets to women's shirts to avoid higher duties, and Converse adds fuzzy felt to its All-Stars sneakers to classify them as slippers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new report from Zillow, choosing the right interior paint colors can boost a home's sale price by nearly $2,600. Olive green is currently the most desirable kitchen color, potentially increasing a home's value by up to $1,600. Buyers also favor classic navy walls in bedrooms, willing to pay approximately $1,815 more for a home with this color. Dark gray living rooms are also preferred over lighter colors, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors like lemon yellow in kitchens or scarlet red in bedrooms can decrease a home's sale price.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is increasingly strategically important, especially with continued higher U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, but he doubts that trade levies alone will revitalize the manufacturing sector. Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary after Trump reversed his initial opposition, with the company pledging to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh.

          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), stated that students should be prepared to encounter shocking and offensive views at university as part of their education. The OfS published guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech, emphasizing that universities must allow for the discussion of any topic, even if offensive, within legal boundaries. The guidance follows a fine issued to the University of Sussex for failing to protect free speech, underscoring the importance of balancing free expression with the need to prevent harassment and unlawful discrimination.</p>
