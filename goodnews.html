          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake, one of the strongest ever recorded, struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, prompting extensive tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. The powerful temblor caused some flooding and damage in the sparsely populated region near its epicenter. However, the tsunami's impact was less severe than initially feared in more distant, populated areas, with waves being relatively small and causing only minor flooding in places like Hawaii. Emergency officials remained on high alert as the series of waves continued for hours.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the MLB trade deadline, the Philadelphia Phillies executed a major move by acquiring hard-throwing closer Jhoan Durán from the Minnesota Twins in exchange for two top prospects. The deal was part of a busy day of trades that saw several contenders strengthen their bullpens for the playoff push. In other notable moves, the New York Mets landed submarine-style pitcher Tyler Rogers and reliever Ryan Helsley in separate deals, while the Cincinnati Reds acquired Gold Glove third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the Pittsburgh Pirates.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have finalized a trade deal that sets a blanket 15% tariff on South Korean exports, avoiding a threatened 25% rate. As part of the agreement, President Trump announced that South Korea would provide a $350 billion fund for investments in the U.S. However, the two nations appear to have different interpretations of the fund, with Washington emphasizing U.S. control and profits, while Seoul views it as a vehicle to support its own companies' entry into the American market.

          <p>South Korea has successfully negotiated a trade deal with the U.S., securing a 15% tariff rate and preventing steeper levies. A significant victory for Seoul was protecting its highly sensitive agricultural markets, as it did not have to further open its rice and beef industries to American imports. The agreement also includes a $350 billion investment from South Korea into the U.S., with $150 billion specifically designated for shipbuilding cooperation, leveraging one of South Korea's industrial strengths to address U.S. security and manufacturing concerns.

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has formally submitted a rival proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the long-held plans of the airport's own operator. The Arora Group's plan, named Heathrow West, centers on a shorter third runway that would be less expensive and avoid the highly disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. This development introduces competition into the massive infrastructure project for the first time, potentially offering a more cost-effective and less complex path to increasing the airport's capacity.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported impressive second-quarter financial results, with revenue jumping 45% year-over-year to $989 million, comfortably beating Wall Street forecasts. The growth was fueled by a significant increase in funded customers, which climbed by 2.3 million, and a near doubling of total platform assets to $279 billion. The company's push into broader wealth management services appears to be succeeding, as it continues to attract new clients and assets while also benefiting from strong net deposits and higher market valuations.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani was forced to leave his pitching start early during a game against the Cincinnati Reds due to cramping. On a hot and humid evening, Ohtani showed visible discomfort and lost command of his pitches in the fourth inning, prompting his removal from the mound as a precautionary measure. While his pitching outing was cut short after 51 pitches, he was able to remain in the game to continue his duties as the team's designated hitter.</p>

The Fed remains in a cautious stance, citing the need to further assess the uncertain impact of the administration's new tariffs on both economic growth and inflation before making a policy move.

          <p>This article uses the recent major earthquake off Russia's coast to explain the science behind tsunamis and how to stay safe. It details that tsunamis are typically generated by large, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor, displacing enormous volumes of water. These waves travel at incredible speeds in the deep ocean and only become towering and destructive as they slow down and pile up in shallower coastal waters, which is why immediate evacuation to higher ground upon receiving a warning is critical.</p>

These deep-sea ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor.</p>

While some experts continue to link rising depression rates to screen use, others suggest factors like loneliness are more critical and that technology, when used appropriately, can even enhance well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being one of the most powerful earthquakes ever recorded, the recent magnitude 8.8 temblor off Russia's coast resulted in surprisingly limited tsunami damage across the Pacific. Scientists explain that the tsunami's energy was primarily directed into a vast, open stretch of the ocean between Alaska and Hawaii, a sparsely populated corridor. This directionality allowed much of the energy to dissipate over the long distance, meaning that by the time the waves reached the U.S. West Coast and other populated areas, their size and power were significantly diminished.</p>
