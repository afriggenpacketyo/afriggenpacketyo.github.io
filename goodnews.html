          <p>This article explores the history and challenges of implementing the REAL ID Act, a law passed in 2005 following the 9/11 Commission's recommendations to improve identification security. The deadline for REAL ID enforcement has been repeatedly extended due to various concerns, including privacy issues and logistical difficulties. Critics initially worried about the creation of a national ID card and the potential for identity theft. While some concerns have been addressed, the author, who initially opposed REAL ID, now has one but still believes the federal government should repeal the law, emphasizing the importance of individual choice. The article provides context on the ongoing debate surrounding national identification standards.</p>
