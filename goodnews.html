          <p>Europe has secured a commanding 11½–4½ lead against the United States going into the final day's singles matches at the Ryder Cup, needing only 2.5 more points to retain the trophy. This historic lead marks Europe's largest ever pre-singles advantage. The event was marred by unsportsmanlike conduct from American galleries, who directed "thuggish, moronic, and personal insults" at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry, leading to ejections. Despite the controversy, Europe's exceptional performance has positioned them for a decisive victory.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he often served as the swing vote on pivotal cases. Kennedy expresses deep concern about the current state of American democracy, citing the replacement of reasoned discourse with antagonism, and even worries about the tone of some Supreme Court opinions. He details his evolving views on same-sex marriage and abortion, emphasizing that "liberty must be understood over time" and that a moral wrong isn't always a legal one. Kennedy also recounts a touching reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia before his death.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss citizens are voting on Sunday on a revised proposal to introduce electronic identity cards, after a similar plan was rejected in 2021 due to privacy concerns. The new proposal ensures the system remains public, stores data on users' smartphones, and is optional, with traditional ID cards still available. Supporters argue it will streamline online bureaucratic procedures, while opponents fear potential privacy erosion and data misuse for tracking or marketing. Despite Switzerland's strong privacy traditions, recent opinion polls suggest voters might now be more open to the e-ID, possibly influenced by their positive experience with Covid ID.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain following a cyber attack that halted production for weeks. The Business Secretary stated the loan aims to protect jobs in the automotive sector, which employs 150,000 people. JLR, owned by Tata Motors, has ceased placing orders with its 700 suppliers, with the shutdown costing an estimated £50 million weekly.
