          <p>The Republic of Ireland secured a vital 1-0 victory against Armenia in a World Cup qualifier, with Evan Ferguson scoring the decisive goal in the 70th minute. The game's major flashpoint saw Armenia captain Tigran Barseghyan dismissed seven minutes into the second half after headbutting Ireland midfielder Finn Azaz, who stated Barseghyan "lost his head." This red card provided Ireland with a crucial numerical advantage, which they leveraged to earn their first win in the qualifying campaign. The nervy victory moves the Republic of Ireland to third in Group F, just a point behind Hungary, intensifying their quest for a play-off spot with two games remaining.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is aggressively pivoting towards vertical integration, aiming to control every aspect of its AI business from infrastructure to consumer devices. The company partnered with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, signaling a move into chipmaking to optimize its models. This strategy, likened to Apple's M-series chips, aims for deeper control over its technology stack. Additionally, OpenAI's acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, indicates a push into consumer hardware, exploring AI-native devices beyond traditional screens. These blockbuster deals, including significant investments in Nvidia and AMD systems, are part of a coordinated campaign called Stargate, solidifying OpenAI's leadership in AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>NBA star Tyrese Haliburton, formerly a Milwaukee Brewers fan, is now actively rooting against them in the NLCS, stemming from a perceived snub. Haliburton, who hails from Wisconsin, explained on "The Pat McAfee Show" that the Brewers canceled his scheduled ceremonial first pitch last summer after his Indiana Pacers eliminated the Milwaukee Bucks from the 2024 NBA playoffs. Feeling like a "free agent" in baseball fandom, he has since publicly supported Brewers' opponents by wearing their jerseys, including the Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers. This personal story underscores the deep-seated rivalries and shifts in loyalty that can occur within the world of professional sports.</p>

          <p>Writer John T. Edge, acclaimed for his work on Southern food and culture, has released a new memoir, "House of Smoke: A Southerner Goes Searching for Home," which delves into his own troubled family history.
