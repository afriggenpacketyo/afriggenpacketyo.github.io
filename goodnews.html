        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Zurich are poised to vote on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums, driven by growing public concerns over noise and air pollution. If passed in Sunday's referendum, gas-powered devices would be entirely banned, and even electric ones would be limited to use only from October to December, with special permits needed for other times. Supporters argue these machines are detrimental to microorganisms and spread fine dust, advocating for traditional rakes as a more eco-friendly alternative. Opponents, however, decry the proposed ban as an 'anti-social culture of prohibition' that would create undue hardship, underscoring a local debate about environmental regulation's practical implications for citizens and maintenance workers alike.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has pledged to commence the construction of three new towns before the next general election, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in North London identified as initial promising sites. This initiative is central to Labour's vision for economic growth and aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, with at least 40% designated as affordable housing. A New Towns Unit will be established to secure funding for essential infrastructure like GP surgeries, schools, and transport. The plans, welcomed by the New Towns Taskforce, are inspired by post-war Labour housing booms, though local residents like those in Tempsford express concern over a lack of consultation regarding the scale of development.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's potential plan to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications could inadvertently benefit the Middle East, positioning it as a major winner in the global competition for AI talent. Gulf nations, particularly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, are aggressively investing billions in AI-focused national strategies, offering highly competitive compensation packages, tax-friendly environments, and long-term "golden visas" to attract top tech professionals. This strategic push, coupled with a business-friendly ecosystem, could see the region outflank the U.S., UK, and Europe in securing skilled foreign expertise. While concerns about stability and citizenship pathways exist, the Middle East is increasingly seen as a long-term hub for innovation and growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss voters are heading to the polls for a second time to decide on the introduction of electronic identity cards, after rejecting a similar proposal in 2021 due to privacy concerns. The revised plan ensures the e-ID system remains optional, publicly controlled, and stores data on individual smartphones rather than centrally. Supporters argue it will streamline bureaucratic procedures and daily transactions, making life easier for citizens. However, opponents, citing Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy protection, fear the measure could still undermine individual privacy and lead to data misuse. Despite these concerns, recent polls suggest voters may now be more open to the digital ID, influenced by their positive experience with the government's COVID ID.</p>

While the team has historically capitalized on dead-ball situations, securing a Carabao Cup win through a set-play last season, they've struggled to convert opportunities this season, scoring only once from corners or free-kicks. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledges the need for improvement, emphasizing his responsibility for the team's current lack of clinical execution in these areas. The article highlights Newcastle's evolving approach, including an increased use of long throws, as they aim to unlock their set-piece potential and challenge Arsenal, who currently lead the league in expected goals from dead-ball situations.</p>

          <p>An opinion article passionately refutes Donald Trump's problematic statements about autism, instead highlighting positive autistic traits as valuable lessons he could learn. The author emphasizes autistic individuals' profound capacity for deep, intense focus, their unwavering adherence to facts and logic, and a strong, often overwhelming, sense of empathy and social justice. These qualities are sharply contrasted with Trump's perceived scattergun approach to politics, his documented history of false claims, and his apparent inability to show empathy. The article also celebrates the exceptional memory and pure, uninhibited joy often expressed by autistic people, such as "stim" behaviors like hand flapping, advocating for a more accepting and nuanced understanding of autism.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with significant roster decisions for their upcoming best-of-three wild-card series, primarily due to ongoing health concerns among key players. Max Muncy, Will Smith, and Tommy Edman are battling injuries, leaving their availability for the postseason opener uncertain, though Edman did return as a designated hitter. Manager Dave Roberts faces tough choices, particularly within the pitching staff, as he evaluates numerous relief candidates to balance left-handed and right-handed depth. The team is also keeping its Game 1 starting pitcher a secret, with Shohei Ohtani being a strong option but also presenting strategic considerations for his two-way role. These final days are crucial for solidifying the roster.</p>

          <p>Rock Springs, Wyoming, a town long priding itself on its diverse immigrant history, has unveiled a significant new monument to commemorate the 1885 massacre of 28 Chinese immigrants. This statue, "Requiem," stands as a more prominent acknowledgment of a dark past rooted in labor tensions and anti-Chinese violence, replacing a previously understated plaque. Mayor Max Mickelson, an "Old School Republican," supported the monument, while also expressing frustration with current anti-immigrant policies, revealing a nuanced local political perspective. Descendants of the massacre, many of whom only recently discovered their familial ties to the event, participated in the commemoration, underscoring a crucial effort to educate the public and foster healing around this violent chapter of American history.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, has expressed confidence that his government can "pull this round" despite recent opinion polls indicating Labour trails Reform UK, as the party heads into its annual conference. Starmer plans to leverage the Liverpool conference to position Labour as a patriotic alternative, sharply criticizing Nigel Farage and Reform UK for their divisive policies, particularly the proposal to abolish Indefinite Leave to Remain. He argues that such a policy would "tear this country apart" by potentially deporting long-term residents who contribute significantly to society. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood further suggested exploring changes to ILR laws, aiming to link long-term settlement not just to economic contributions but also to wider community engagement.</p>

          <p>Singer Florence Welch has revealed she underwent life-saving emergency surgery in August 2023 after experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, a harrowing event she described as "the closest I came to death." Welch, 39, was unknowingly suffering severe internal bleeding while performing on stage and was diagnosed with a ruptured fallopian tube that necessitated immediate surgical removal. She had previously canceled planned concerts, vaguely citing reasons she wasn't "strong enough to go into yet," which are now understood. The article underscores the critical and potentially life-threatening nature of ectopic pregnancies, which affect one in 90 pregnancies in the UK if left undiagnosed. Welch is now recovering and preparing to release her new album, "Everybody Scream," in October.</p>

          <p>Lt. Col. George E. Hardy, the last surviving Tuskegee Airman who flew combat missions during WWII in Europe, has died at the age of 100. Hardy, who joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at 18, completed 21 missions in WWII, 45 in the Korean War, and 70 in the Vietnam War, earning numerous honors including the Distinguished Flying Cross. The Tuskegee Airmen, the first Black aviators of the U.S. Armed Forces, faced systemic racism in the U.S. but Hardy noted less segregation while stationed in Italy. He retired in 1971, considering his education his greatest achievement. His passing marks the end of an era for a group symbolizing courage, resilience, and perseverance against prejudice.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry secured a crucial point for Europe at the Ryder Cup, leading them to a commanding 11½-4½ advantage over the United States, despite facing intense hostility from the New York crowd. The European duo endured personal insults and disruptive shouts, with Lowry almost confronting a fan and McIlroy being forced to back away from shots. European captain Luke Donald acknowledged the 'challenging day,' noting the team had prepared for such an environment. The tension also spilled over into a verbal exchange between Justin Rose and Bryson DeChambeau's caddie. Europe now needs only three more points on Sunday to secure their first away victory since 2012.</p>
