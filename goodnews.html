          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell achieved a surprising pole position at the Singapore Grand Prix, outpacing Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Russell's performance marks his first pole since June and a significant result for Mercedes at the Marina Bay circuit. The qualifying session saw championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren take third, while his teammate and rival Lando Norris placed fifth. Verstappen expressed frustration, blaming a slow-moving Norris on his final lap for preventing him from potentially capturing the top spot.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has been instructed to "advance readiness" for the initial stage of a hostage release agreement proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. This development follows Hamas's statement that it would agree to the terms of the Gaza peace proposal, which calls for the release of all Israeli hostages. While preparing for implementation, the Israel Defense Forces emphasized that troop safety is a top priority and that forces have moved into a defensive-only posture within Gaza. President Trump has indicated a deal is close, setting a Sunday deadline for Hamas to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 achieving another record high despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Investors appeared to treat the shutdown as a "non-event," focusing instead on positive corporate news and sector-specific trends. The healthcare sector saw a significant rally following a deal between President Trump and Pfizer, which boosted stocks like Danaher and Eli Lilly. Technology and utility sectors also performed well, driven by the continued enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and its substantial power requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to increase their exposure to overseas markets to counteract a significant "home bias." Analysts suggest that international markets, particularly in emerging economies like China and India, may offer better long-term value and growth potential. The argument is supported by the strong performance of funds like the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF, which recently hit a 52-week high. India, in particular, is highlighted for its large population, favorable demographics, and rapid economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Judge Allows Inquiry into Whether Smuggling Case is Retaliation by Trump Administration</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has determined there is evidence that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García for human smuggling might be an act of illegal retaliation by the Trump administration. The judge granted a hearing to explore whether the charges were brought against Ábrego García because he successfully sued the administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The ruling highlighted public statements from administration officials that seemed to link the criminal charges to his legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the broader political conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>After undergoing a comprehensive, 20-year renovation, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in Egypt's Valley of the Kings has reopened to the public. Amenhotep III, who ruled during the prosperous 18th Dynasty, was one of ancient Egypt's most significant pharaohs. The extensive restoration project, led by a Japanese team, focused on preserving the tomb's intricate wall paintings depicting the pharaoh and various gods. This reopening is part of a broader Egyptian initiative to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency, ahead of the Grand Egyptian Museum's inauguration near the Giza Pyramids.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza have responded with a mix of shock, hope, and deep suspicion after Hamas issued a qualified acceptance of a U.S.-led peace proposal and President Trump appeared to welcome it. The carefully worded statement from Hamas accepted terms for hostage releases and a transition to a technocratic government but remained ambiguous on other points. While some Gazans see a historic opportunity to end two years of devastating conflict, others fear it may be a trap, allowing Israel to secure hostages before resuming military operations. The unexpected developments have left many uncertain about what the future holds.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of his decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a then-fledgling online bookstore called Amazon. He recalled that Bill Gates considered the move foolish, but he was convinced by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's vision and obsession with the customer experience. Bezos confidently predicted that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000, a goal it ultimately surpassed a year ahead of schedule. Risher played a key role in that early growth, helping expand Amazon's product categories beyond books into music, movies, and toys.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist recommends a unique practice for new parents: creating an email address for their newborn children. She uses these accounts to send messages, stories, and photos, creating a digital time capsule that her children can access when they are older. The emails capture everyday moments, birthday wishes, and even reflections during difficult times, preserving a legacy of love and connection. The expert suggests this practice not only provides a treasured keepsake for the child but also serves as a valuable journaling outlet for the parent.</p>
