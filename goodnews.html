          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region demonstrated a mixed but generally positive performance as investors monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. This occurred alongside uncertainty following a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined. The market sentiment reflects a cautious optimism, balancing potential diplomatic outcomes from the SCO meeting against ongoing trade policy disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who was born with a congenital disability, is highlighting the significant accessibility challenges within the historic Houses of Parliament. In an interview, she pointed out numerous physical barriers, from heavy doors with difficult handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. While some modernizations have occurred, Tidball argues that the building's structure and archaic procedures create obstacles that are unacceptable in a place that passed the Equalities Act. A parliamentary committee is currently reviewing these issues with a report expected later this year.</p>

Harris sustained an eye injury in a Fourth of July fireworks accident, which he described as a humbling experience, but clarified the injury was superficial. After being cleared for contact, he has been practicing with the team while wearing a tinted visor. Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed there is a possibility Harris will play, noting he has looked "really, really good" since returning to practice.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a historic treasure and a benchmark of national park architecture. Built in 1904 from approximately 10,000 trees, it was once advertised as the largest log cabin in the world. The inn's unique design, featuring twisted and gnarled wood, was crafted by architect Robert Reamer, who sought out "freaks of the forest" for its construction. For over a century, this iconic lodge has welcomed millions of visitors and is credited with popularizing the rustic architectural style seen in other grand national park lodges across the United States.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an emergency request from lawyers who argued the government was attempting to bypass legal protections for minors. The administration contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families and the Guatemalan government. The judge justified the extraordinary measure by noting the government's plan was being executed during the "wee hours" of a holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Musician Tom Odell has discussed the unexpected influence one of his 2016 concerts had on superstars Billie Eilish and Finneas O'Connell. Odell, who considered the show a personal failure, was unaware that the siblings were in the audience and that the performance inspired Finneas to pursue his own music career. This connection led to Eilish inviting Odell to open for her world tour, coinciding with his own career resurgence fueled by his song "Black Friday" gaining viral traction on TikTok. Odell reflects on this as a lesson that one never knows the positive effect they might have on others.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with the total outlay for the summer window surpassing £3 billion. This figure is significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion and exceeds the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The record was broken on deadline day, highlighted by Liverpool's £125 million acquisition of Alexander Isak from Newcastle. This unprecedented spending underscores the immense financial power of England's top football flight compared to its European counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool has shattered the record for the most money spent by a single club in a transfer window, with an outlay of £415 million, culminating in the £125 million signing of Alexander Isak. This marks a significant shift from the club's previously more conservative transfer policy under former manager Jurgen Klopp. The spending spree was fueled by a combination of factors, including restrained spending in previous windows, significant commercial growth, and over £200 million raised from player sales. The club aimed to capitalize on its recent Premier League title success to attract top talent and evolve the team's style of play.</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is receiving early Oscar buzz for his dramatic turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after feeling "pigeon-holed" as a blockbuster action star for years. Early reviews praise his performance as a "revelation," with critics noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal of Kerr's life, including his struggles with substance abuse. The film represents a significant departure from Johnson's typical big-budget fare.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political and security bloc including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. The move is seen by analysts as a strategic effort to insulate member countries from risks associated with the US dollar-dominated global financial system. By creating their own concessional lender, the 10 member nations aim to accelerate key infrastructure projects and foster greater economic independence. The official announcement confirms that consultations regarding the financial institution's operations will be accelerated, marking a significant step for the long-discussed initiative.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating, researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting estimates. The fossil, often grouped with the species Homo heidelbergensis, possesses features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new dating strengthens the theory that this more primitive human population coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to Europe's evolutionary history.</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, may be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days due to heightened solar activity. According to the Met Office, a recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has increased the likelihood of sightings farther south than is typical. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, there is a "decent chance" for a memorable display. The best opportunities for viewing are expected on Monday and Tuesday night, with the Midlands potentially having the clearest skies.</p>

          <p>Despite a year of unprecedented late-career achievements, questions remain about Novak Djokovic's physical durability as he advances in the US Open. The 38-year-old has become the oldest man in the open era to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in a single year. However, his recent major tournament appearances have been marked by physical issues, including a hamstring injury in Australia and other ailments during the current event. While his performance level has been high, his ability to withstand the grueling demands of two weeks of best-of-five-set matches against top opponents remains a significant concern.</p>
