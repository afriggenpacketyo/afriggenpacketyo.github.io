        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, to lead his team to a massive first-innings total of 587 in the second Test at Edgbaston. In response, England's top order collapsed, finishing the day at a precarious 77-3. Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope were dismissed on consecutive deliveries, followed shortly by Zak Crawley, leaving India firmly in control. After letting a winning position slip in the first Test, India now holds a commanding advantage as they seek to level the five-match series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite slower economic growth. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the federal workforce saw continued cuts. Despite the strong report, economists remain cautious about the second half of the year, citing potential impacts from tariffs, which may lead the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 15:03:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average U.S. mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth consecutive week, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.67%. This downward trend provides a potential opening for homebuyers in a market with persistently high prices. Experts note that while the Federal Reserve may not cut its benchmark rate in July, a cut is anticipated in September, which could further influence mortgage rates. For current homebuyers, this period presents an opportunity to check their credit, research real estate agents, and secure mortgage pre-approval to be better positioned if the market becomes more competitive.

          <h2>Review: 'Nobu' Documentary Focuses More on Brand-Building Than Culinary Arts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" profiles the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film is critiqued for emphasizing his global brand over his culinary genius. The review notes that the film is most compelling when it shows Matsuhisa's meticulous demand for quality or investor Robert De Niro's concerns about rapid expansion. However, it often resembles a gentle chronology of a humble man's rise, rather than a deep exploration of his revolutionary impact on high-end dining. While the food looks delicious, the documentary is said to lack sufficient testimony on the actual experience of eating at his restaurants.</p>

          <p>Actor John Leguizamo returns for a second season of his docuseries "Leguizamo Does America," exploring Latino communities in cities like Philadelphia, Phoenix, and New Orleans. The new season premieres on MSNBC in a different political climate under the Trump administration, where threats of mass deportations loom over Latino communities. Leguizamo describes the show as an "antidote" to the erasure and mistreatment of Latinos, aiming to highlight their history and contributions. The series, which focuses on everyday people making a difference, is seen by its creators as a form of resistance and a way to foster understanding.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Signs That Credit Card Debt Is Too Large for a DIY Payoff Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 14:42:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card interest rates exceeding 21%, many Americans find their debt growing into an overwhelming burden. This article outlines five key signs that a do-it-yourself payoff plan may no longer be sufficient. These red flags include being unable to pay more than the minimum, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards for essential living expenses. When these situations arise, it may be time to consider professional help, such as credit counseling or debt settlement programs, to regain financial control. (not investment advice)</p>
