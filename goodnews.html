        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the culminating bout of their epic trilogy, Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a majority decision victory over Amanda Serrano, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship. The fight, held at a sold-out Madison Square Garden, was a gripping, tactical affair that differed from their previous all-out brawls but remained intensely compelling. Two judges scored the contest 97-93 for Taylor, while one scored it a 95-95 draw. The event was particularly historic as it was the first all-female card hosted at the iconic venue, with Taylor acknowledging that she and Serrano are now "history makers forever" in the world of women's boxing.</p>

          <p>In a significant move amidst the competitive AI talent landscape, Google has announced a deal to hire Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff. The agreement, valued at $2.4 billion, primarily consists of licensing fees and compensation, with Google gaining a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology. This development follows reports that Windsurf had been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The deal highlights an intensifying talent war, where major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are aggressively acquiring key personnel and technology from promising AI startups to bolster their own development efforts.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Temporarily Halts Indiscriminate Immigration Stops in Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 23:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration stops in seven Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling by Judge Maame E. Frimpong came in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocacy groups, which accused federal agents of unconstitutional racial profiling by targeting individuals based on their appearance or location. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at day laborer sites. The order follows recent clashes between protesters and agents during raids.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing backlash for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted after Prada presented the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its cultural origins, sparking criticism from Indian fashion communities. In response, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful partnership between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities, prompting the Chamber to pursue a patent for the sandals.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward, marking a notable development in the legal battles against AI companies. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege their voices were cloned and used without proper consent after they were hired for what they were told were internal or academic projects. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the use of their voices in training data will proceed. The case highlights growing concerns from artists over the unauthorized use of their work by AI.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are increasingly establishing a global presence, driven by growing demand from Chinese companies expanding overseas and a supportive push from Beijing. As of last year, there were 208 overseas branches of Chinese law firms, a 70 percent increase from 2018. This expansion reflects a preference among Chinese businesses for legal support from their compatriots, whom they tend to trust more. However, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions. The trend underscores the vital role lawyers play in supporting the global ambitions of Chinese enterprises in a rapidly changing international landscape.</p>

          <p>With the patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, a wave of more affordable generic versions is anticipated. Currently, around 60 similar drugs are undergoing trials in China, positioning the country to become a major player in the global weight-loss market, which is projected to reach US$150 billion. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic manufacturers will enter the market, significantly driving down prices. This development could grant millions of patients with obesity and diabetes better access to these transformative treatments, which are currently too expensive for many who need them.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a major $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in activity attributed to rising tariffs and global trade uncertainty. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of new land and extend the quay to accommodate larger ships, aiming to boost cargo-handling capacity by 50%. Officials acknowledge the current period of uncertainty in the shipping industry but remain confident in the long-term demand for increased capacity. This move comes as both the Port of Long Beach and the nearby Port of Los Angeles have reported sharp drops in container movement and exports in recent months.</p>

          <p>Narciso Barranco, an undocumented immigrant and father of three U.S. Marines, is set to be released on bond after being held for 20 days in a federal facility. His arrest went viral after a video showed masked federal agents violently tackling and beating him outside a Santa Ana IHOP. An immigration judge ordered his release on a $3,000 bond, and his family plans to seek immediate medical care for injuries they believe he sustained during the arrest. Barranco, who has lived in the U.S. for decades and is married to a U.S. citizen, had applied for parole-in-place, a program for relatives of military members, before his highly publicized detention.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and former teenage prodigy Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the All England Club. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically had an uneasy relationship with grass but has found formidable form during the tournament. Anisimova is fulfilling her potential after a break for mental health and enters the final as a dangerous underdog with an aggressive game. With the two having never played at the tour level, the outcome will likely depend on who better manages the immense pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's nothing-to-lose freedom.</p>
