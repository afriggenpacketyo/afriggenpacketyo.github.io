          <p>The government is set to reveal a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at reducing energy costs for over 7,000 UK businesses, potentially slashing bills by up to 25%. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, exempting manufacturers from certain green energy levies, and increasing discounts on network charges for energy-intensive firms. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer described the strategy as a turning point for Britain's economy, while critics raised concerns about the costs of net zero and the impact of the Employment Rights Bill on growth. The strategy also focuses on upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, and streamlining planning processes to boost innovation and create new jobs. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy, which combines intravenous ketamine infusions with psychotherapy. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. Experts hope that making ketamine therapy available on the NHS will provide a more accessible option for patients with treatment-resistant depression. </p>
