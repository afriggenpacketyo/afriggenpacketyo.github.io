          <p>U.S. applications for unemployment benefits remained unchanged last week, indicating that layoffs remain low despite economic uncertainties related to President Trump's tariffs. The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid was 229,000 for the week ending May 10, aligning with analysts' forecasts. Weekly applications are viewed as a reliable indicator of U.S. layoffs and have largely remained within a healthy range since the COVID-19 pandemic. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of May 3 rose by 9,000 to 1.88 million, reflecting a stable labor market.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his disapproval to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India. Trump referenced Apple's $500 billion investment in the U.S. and stated he wants Apple to build in the United States, not India. Apple has been increasing its production in India, aiming to manufacture around 25% of its global iPhones there to reduce its reliance on China, where approximately 90% of its smartphones are currently assembled. Trump emphasized that the U.S. has accommodated Apple's plants in China for years and now expects the company to prioritize building in America.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta it purchased for $27.50 in 1946 is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. Researchers identified the document by comparing it to the other six known copies from 1300 and using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to examine faded details. The Magna Carta, originally ratified by King John in 1215, is considered a foundation of modern democracy. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to Appleby in Westmorland, England, highlighting its historical significance.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to changes in the economy and policy. Speaking at the Thomas Laubach Research Conference, Powell noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, with the era of near-zero rates unlikely to return soon. He indicated that more frequent and persistent supply shocks could pose a challenge for central banks, requiring a delicate balance between supporting employment and controlling inflation. Powell's remarks align with recent statements about the potential impact of tariffs on slowing growth and boosting inflation.</p>
