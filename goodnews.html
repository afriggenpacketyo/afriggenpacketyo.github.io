          <p>Morecambe FC has appointed 30-year-old Ashvir Singh Johal as their new manager, making him the first Sikh to manage a professional British club and the youngest boss in England's top five football leagues. This historic appointment follows the club's recent takeover by the Panjab Warriors consortium, which ended a period of financial uncertainty for the National League team. Singh Johal, who recently completed his Uefa Pro Licence, brings experience from roles at Leicester City's academy and as an assistant to figures like Kolo Toure and Cesc Fabregas. He aims to create a high-standard environment that fosters identity and daily improvement.</p>

          <p>According to the U.S. director of national intelligence, the UK has rescinded a controversial demand that would have compelled Apple to create a "back door" for accessing encrypted user data globally. The formal notice, issued under the Investigatory Powers Act, had prompted Apple to withdraw its Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market and initiate a legal challenge. Privacy advocates have cautiously welcomed the development, though they remain concerned that the legal powers enabling such demands still exist. The UK government has not officially confirmed the withdrawal, stating it does not comment on operational security matters.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre is projected to win a decisive victory in the Battle River-Crowfoot by-election in Alberta, securing his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre's win comes four months after his party's defeat in the general election, where he lost the Ottawa-area seat he had held for two decades. The special election was called after the sitting Conservative MP stepped down to allow him to run in the party's stronghold. Despite facing a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group, Poilievre's victory was widely expected and allows him to resume his role in Parliament this fall.</p>

          <p>China's National Radio and Television Administration (NRTA) has launched a new plan to improve the quality of television programming, with a focus on documentaries, animations, and mini-dramas. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to expand China's soft power and cultural influence on the international stage. The plan emphasizes providing more support for quality productions and strengthening the legal framework for copyright protection. The NRTA director highlighted that micro-dramas, in particular, have become a significant growth area for China's online audio and video industry, with their overseas influence increasing significantly.</p>

          <p>As the back-to-school season begins, many American families are shopping earlier and focusing on essential items to mitigate the impact of inflation and potential tariffs on imported goods. According to the National Retail Federation, families are projected to spend an average of $858, slightly down from last year but significantly higher than in 2019. The cost of school supplies is at a record high, prompting consumers to seek discounts, compare prices online, and consider refurbished electronics. Experts suggest buying store-brand products and providing teens with gift cards to manage budgets effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Open has reimagined its mixed doubles event, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek with large cash prizes and a shorter format, but the move has polarized the tennis world. Supporters believe the star power will draw more fans and promote the sport, while critics, including doubles specialists, argue it devalues a Grand Slam title and becomes a "glorified exhibition." The winning pair will earn $1 million, five times more than last year's champions, a point of contention for doubles players who are largely excluded from the new 16-team field. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between tradition and commercialization in professional tennis.</p>

          <p>Following a summit in Washington, President Trump announced that European nations, in coordination with the U.S., would provide security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a potential peace deal to end the war with Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the development as a major step forward, stating that the agreement would be formalized within 10 days and include a significant purchase of American weapons. While details remain scant, the guarantees are expected to involve strengthening the Ukrainian military and having reassurance forces from countries like the UK, France, and Germany. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that many uncertainties and obstacles to a final peace agreement persist.</p>

          <p>Helsinki has become one of the largest European cities to record zero traffic fatalities in the past year, a success attributed to its comprehensive Traffic Safety Development Programme. Key measures include reducing speed limits to 30 km/h on more than half of the city's streets, particularly around schools, and enhancing infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists. The city uses extensive data collection on crashes and driving speeds to identify and redesign dangerous areas. This proactive approach, which aligns with the EU's "Vision Zero" goal, combines smart planning, improved public transport, and effective speed enforcement to create a safer urban environment.</p>

The article explains that a car's performance differs between qualifying and race day primarily because peak tire grip in a single lap can mask underlying balance and downforce flaws. These flaws lead to faster tire degradation over a long race stint. Additionally, the piece clarifies that engine and gearbox components are sealed by the FIA, and breaking these seals to perform unauthorized work constitutes a replacement that incurs penalties.</p>

The campaign received widespread support, including a £1.89 million grant from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and over 2,800 public donations. The acquisition was made possible after a temporary export bar was placed on the artwork, recognizing its national importance and providing an opportunity for a UK institution to purchase it.</p>

          <p>A writer shares her complex experience of being advised to adopt a healthier diet for high cholesterol after spending years recovering from anorexia. She describes how her recovery involved rejecting food restriction, but this led to physically unhealthy habits that she initially viewed as a sign of mental wellness. The diagnosis forced her to confront how society's health messaging often conflates weight with health and can be triggering for those with a history of eating disorders. She reflects on the challenge of pursuing physical health without relapsing into disordered eating patterns, criticizing a culture that is poorly equipped to support this delicate balance.</p>

His 89-second fight against Peter McNeeley, promoted as "He's Back," shattered pay-per-view records, earning $96 million despite its farcical and anticlimactic ending. The event demonstrated that spectacle and celebrity could trump competitive substance, setting a precedent for modern boxing events featuring social media influencers and crossover stars.
