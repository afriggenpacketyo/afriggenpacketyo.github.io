Meanwhile, Amazon refuted negative speculation by announcing its recent Prime Day was the largest in its history, setting new records for sales.

          <p>The U.S. Pentagon has signed a contract to use Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot from Elon Musk's company, xAI. The agreement, part of a new $200 million deal, will make Grok's capabilities available across the federal government through a "Grok for Government" suite of tools. This move aligns with the Trump administration's push for greater AI adoption in national security. The announcement follows recent controversy where Grok generated antisemitic content, an issue the company stated it has since addressed and patched.</p>

          <h2>Examining the "Age 75 Rule" for Purchasing Annuities in Retirement Planning</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the "age 75 rule," a common but informal belief that retirees should wait until age 75 to purchase an annuity to secure higher monthly payouts. While it is true that payouts increase with age because insurers anticipate a shorter payment period, the rule oversimplifies a complex financial decision. Waiting until 75 may not be optimal for everyone, as it ignores the immediate income needs of many retirees and the risk of developing health issues that could limit options later. The best time to buy an annuity ultimately depends on individual retirement goals, risk tolerance, and overall financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have uncovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, dating back 3,500 years, at a site on the northern tip of Guam. The discovery was made in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery within a cave. Experts believe the rice was not for daily consumption but played a role in specialized rituals, given its association with rare rock art and formal burials in the cave. This finding suggests the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a remarkable 2,300-kilometer open-ocean journey.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has released a preview of Kiro, a new artificial intelligence tool designed to assist developers in writing software. CEO Andy Jassy stated the program could "transform how developers build software" by simplifying the process of so-called vibe coding, where code is generated with minimal human direction. Kiro aims to improve on existing tools by helping users define requirements and system design before writing code, creating diagrams and task lists to track progress. The move places Amazon in direct competition with similar AI coding tools from Microsoft and Google.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, this article provides guidance on choosing between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. It advises students to exhaust federal loan options first, as they offer fixed interest rates and crucial borrower protections like income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. However, federal loans have strict borrowing limits. Private loans can fill the funding gap but often require a strong credit history or a co-signer and lack the flexible repayment options of their federal counterparts, making a balanced approach essential.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for use in foods and beverages, derived from the fruit of the gardenia flower. The color is created by refining a compound from crushed gardenia fruit and is approved for use in products like sports drinks, teas, and candy. This marks the fourth naturally sourced color approved by the FDA in the last two months, aligning with a push from health officials to phase out petroleum-based dyes.

          <p>Two recent federal court rulings in cases brought by authors against AI firms Anthropic and Meta have provided a complex, and at times contradictory, initial legal perspective on AI training. Both judges found that using copyrighted books to train AI models constitutes "fair use" because the resulting technology is transformative and does not directly compete with the original books. However, the judges disagreed on key points, such as whether AI-generated content poses a significant market threat to authors. The rulings also left the companies vulnerable to litigation over their use of "pirate libraries" to acquire the training data.</p>

The rally has helped Bitcoin's market capitalization exceed one trillion dollars again.
