          <p>President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil has arrived in China for a state visit focused on establishing new partnerships and signing cooperation agreements across multiple areas. Lula emphasized the strategic importance of Brazil's relationship with China, its largest trading partner since 2009, as he aims to bolster ties through a gathering of Latin American leaders in Beijing. China is actively seeking to enhance its relationships with Latin American countries amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States, where high-level negotiators are convening in Geneva to discuss tariffs, although no major breakthroughs are anticipated. The visit underscores China's broader strategy to deepen its economic and diplomatic influence in Latin America.</p>

          <p>China is shifting its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, Chinese investments in Africa's energy sector, including renewables, totaled $66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. The adoption of Chinese wind and solar tech in Africa is driven by its global competitiveness and the continent's growing energy needs. This trend aligns with China's global commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas and reflects Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>

          <p>The government is implementing new immigration plans focused on deporting migrants who commit crimes, marking the biggest overhaul of immigration laws since Brexit. The Home Office will be notified of all foreign nationals convicted of any offence, granting officials broader powers to remove them from the UK. The changes aim to prevent foreign criminals from abusing human rights laws to avoid deportation, with Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stating the new rules are essential to regain control. The plans also seek to reduce reliance on foreign workers and increase employment among young British citizens, driving down the reliance on foreign workers while getting soaring numbers of unemployed, young Brits into jobs.</p>

          <p>Wayne Dopson, a project manager in Brisbane, Australia, shares his experience of swapping his gas truck for a Chinese BYD Shark hybrid pickup, praising its luxurious interior, smooth drive, and powerful performance. He highlights the cost-effectiveness of running the hybrid, particularly with solar panels providing free daytime electricity, and the convenience of power outlets for on-site tools. However, Dopson expresses concerns about the resale value due to rapid advancements in EV technology and the potential for the Shark to become obsolete within five years. Despite these concerns, he believes that increased competition from Chinese EV brands in Australia is beneficial, offering longer warranties and better quality cars.</p>

Despite being unpopular among his fellow Greenlanders, Boassen's advocacy for closer U.S.-Greenland ties has positioned him as a key figure in the debate about the island's future. He now works for an organization promoting this alliance, driven by a belief that Denmark has failed to adequately defend Greenland. Boassen's transformation from bricklayer to political player began with his prolific social media posts supporting Trump, catching the eye of a former Trump advisor.</p>

          <p>A Chinese team has developed a unique algorithm enabling first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers, surpassing human capabilities in intense flight missions. Published in Science Robotics, the breakthrough involves high-risk maneuvers traditionally avoided in conventional flight. This biological inspiration, transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards,' holds the key to redefining traditional drone flight paradigms. Aerial acrobatics, vital for species like sparrowhawks and falcons, allow rapid speed and direction adjustments for hunting or obstacle avoidance, showcasing the potential for drones to excel in complex flight scenarios.</p>

The museum, which relies heavily on Canadian tourists, has seen a significant decline in visitors since President Trump initiated tariff wars and questioned the U.S.-Canada border treaty. Faced with 145% tariffs on Chinese-made rubber ducks, the owners are moving the museum across the border to Canada, where they can avoid the tariffs and continue serving their customer base. The move highlights the economic consequences of international trade disputes on small businesses.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial, led by Chinese and US scientists, indicates that a new oral medication called zongertinib shows promise as a safe and effective treatment for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The medication outperformed the standard treatment option, intravenous antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) therapy, while also carrying fewer risks of adverse effects. The study, conducted across 82 sites globally, included 188 NSCLC patients, with Asian populations accounting for a majority. Researchers suggest that zongertinib has the potential to establish a new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC, offering a more effective and less harmful alternative to existing treatments.</p>
