          <p>A 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the New York City area. While the quake was minor, it startled residents, with some reporting it felt like a car hitting their house. Officials confirmed there were no reports of significant damage or injuries. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while earthquakes are rare on the East Coast, this event was not considered significant and caused little reason for alarm, referencing a larger 4.8 magnitude quake from April 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia's Krasheninnikov Volcano, located on the Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash cloud nearly 27,000 feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck the region. While the event prompted an aviation alert, the area is sparsely populated and poses no immediate threat to local communities. Seismologists speculate the earthquake's seismic waves may have triggered the eruption in the geologically active region, shaking loose the magma system.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained the top-grossing film at the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million. This represented a significant 66% drop from its debut, a steeper decline than other recent superhero films. The debut of the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" took second place with $22 million, while the new "The Naked Gun" film opened in third with $17 million. Despite the drop for "Fantastic Four," analysts note that the overall summer box office is still tracking ahead of last year.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has indicated a willingness to make significant acquisitions to accelerate the company's AI roadmap, with reports suggesting a potential deal for the AI chatbot company, Perplexity. Perplexity, valued at around $18 billion, offers a real-time, direct-response AI search engine that aligns with Apple's user-experience focus and could provide an established model for monetizing AI services. While Apple typically makes smaller acquisitions, a deal for Perplexity would represent a major strategic investment to bolster its position in the competitive AI landscape.

          <h2>Florida Emerges as a Leader in Utility-Scale Solar Energy Growth</h2>

          <p>Florida has unexpectedly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is attributed to streamlined state regulations that speed up project development and the increasing economic advantage of solar over natural gas. Despite a state policy that removed climate change from official language, the purely economic case for solar is fueling the boom. However, the industry faces future headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the existing power grid. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India at The Oval is set for a tense conclusion, with the outcome hanging in the balance. England needs just 35 more runs to secure a historic series win, while India needs to take four more wickets. The fourth day saw brilliant centuries from England's Joe Root and Harry Brook, which put their team in a winning position before a late surge from India's bowlers tightened the contest. The match will resume on the fifth day with all possibilities still on the table in a classic nail-biting cricket finale.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on manufactured runs and solid pitching rather than power hitting. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game despite a tense ninth inning. The Dodgers' runs came from aggressive baserunning, a swinging-bunt single, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly, highlighting a shift to situational hitting amid a team-wide slump. The victory gave the Dodgers a winning 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip, providing some needed momentum.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts likely to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not finding hidden commissions unlawful, did deem excessively high commissions to be unfair. The FCA will consult on a formal scheme, estimated to cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion, with the first payments expected next year. The regulator advises affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly to make a claim. (not investment advice)</p>

The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for presentation, not due to any political pressure.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix, closing the championship gap on his teammate Oscar Piastri, but admitted he is "not making life very easy" for himself.

The victory was rewarding but highlighted the small margins and self-inflicted challenges in his tight title battle.
