          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The airport was closed to all flights for much of March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation, but the cause of the fire is still under investigation. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence of suspicious activity. This article discusses the disruption caused by the shutdown and the ongoing investigation into the incident.</p>
