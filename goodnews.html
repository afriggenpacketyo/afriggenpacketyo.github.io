          <p>This article discusses how voters in countries allied with the U.S. are favoring stability over radical change, even after experiencing the disruptive policies of the Trump administration. It references Elon Musk's public criticism of Peter Navarro, highlighting the clash between different approaches to domestic and foreign policy under Trump. The article suggests a broader trend of voters seeking a return to normalcy and predictability in uncertain times, and that voters have been 'shell-shocked' by the recent political climate. The article notes that Musk's reputation has suffered as a result of his leadership of Tesla, while voters in allied nations prefer governments which are more stable.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is expected to announce the framework of a trade agreement with the UK, marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs last month. The specifics remain unclear, and congressional approval is needed for any formal agreement.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has prioritized a separate agreement with the EU, potentially aligning British standards with European ones.</p>

          <p>An avatar of Agatha Christie, created using AI, is set to "teach" an online writing course, sparking debate about the ethics of using AI to reanimate deceased figures. The course, offered by BBC Maestro, uses a digital prosthetic over a real actor's performance, based on Christie's writings and archival interviews. While Christie's family supports the project and emphasizes that it uses her own words, some ethicists raise concerns about consent and the potential for misrepresentation, while others say that it is a useful tool for providing instruction from a creative person.</p>
