          <p>Actress Jessica Alba recently shared a series of summer photos on Instagram, including one of herself in a bikini, shortly after her ex-husband Cash Warren was publicly seen with a new partner. Warren was photographed with model Hana Sun Doerr in Beverly Hills, while Alba has also been linked to actor Danny Ramirez since her divorce filing. Alba announced her separation from Warren in January after nearly 17 years of marriage, citing irreconcilable differences in the official divorce documents. The former couple shares three children and has been awarded joint custody.</p>

          <p>China is considering its first revision to a 1998 pricing law to address "involution," a term for hyper-competitive, often loss-making business practices that have plagued industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed amendment, drafted by top economic planners, aims to combat cutthroat price wars that have led to substantial industry losses and oversupply. For instance, the solar industry has seen a recent 20% price rebound following official calls to end such destructive competition. The revision seeks to establish a more sustainable market equilibrium by regulating pricing and preventing companies from engaging in unsustainable, aggressive price-slashing tactics.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League play-off, marking their first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory mood was bittersweet, however, as the club's star midfielder, Eberechi Eze, was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure post-match, shifting focus to the need for new signings before the transfer window closes. The win represents a significant milestone for the club, which also recently won the FA Cup and Community Shield, as they navigate a new chapter both in Europe and domestically.</p>

          <p>The Colorado Rapids MLS team is allowing fans to exchange jerseys of their former star player, Djordje Mihailović, for a new one following his unexpected trade to Toronto FC. The move comes as the Rapids announced the club-record signing of Paxten Aaronson as his replacement. Mihailović requested the transfer for personal reasons but also implied his new club had a greater commitment to winning, which surprised fans of the playoff-contending Rapids. The jersey exchange program, a rare gesture in professional sports, is intended to show the club's commitment to its supporters and mark a fresh chapter for the team.</p>

          <h2>Wealthy Investors Utilize ETF Conversions to Defer Capital Gains Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 17:28:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging stocks from a portfolio into shares of a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is publicly launched. This allows the investor to postpone paying taxes on the profits until they sell the ETF shares. The process has strict diversification requirements, mandating that no single stock can exceed 25% of the contributed assets. While effective, the strategy has high investment minimums and can limit future investment flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Market Dynamics Shift as Investors Re-evaluate Impact of Fed Rate Cuts on Tech and Cyclical Stocks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-21 17:07:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market activity has challenged the traditional view that lower interest rates primarily benefit high-growth tech stocks. Instead, investors have been rotating out of momentum-driven tech names and into value-oriented, cyclical stocks like Home Depot when the possibility of more aggressive Fed rate cuts increases. The new focus is less on how lower rates impact future earnings valuations and more on which companies will see immediate upward revisions to their current earnings estimates. Economically sensitive sectors stand to benefit more directly from cheaper borrowing costs, while the growth of major AI-related stocks is seen as less dependent on monetary policy.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is considering a petition from the DEA to potentially reclassify psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in "magic mushrooms." Currently a Schedule I narcotic, the most restrictive class, psilocybin could be moved to Schedule II, which recognizes medical value despite a potential for abuse. This federal review follows years of stalled efforts at the state level, including in California, to legalize the substance for therapeutic use. The move was prompted by a long-running legal effort from a Seattle doctor seeking to use psilocybin for end-of-life care for terminally ill patients.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's sold-out concert residency in San Juan has inspired a wave of tourism and a corresponding surge in demand for tattoos related to the artist and Puerto Rican culture. Local tattoo studios are experiencing an unexpected boom, with both locals and visitors seeking permanent souvenirs like the island's national flower, the coquí frog, and lyrics from his new album. Tattoo artists are using the opportunity to educate clients, particularly non-Puerto Ricans, about the cultural significance of the symbols they choose. The trend highlights the deep connection between the artist's music and the island's cultural identity.</p>

          <p>Actress Kirsten Dunst has publicly stated her interest in joining the sequel to the highly successful "A Minecraft Movie," citing a desire to participate in a financially lucrative project. In a recent interview, she half-jokingly remarked, "Maybe I can make a movie where I don’t lose money?" Dunst, whose career began at age three, recently starred in the critically acclaimed but moderately profitable film "Civil War." In contrast, "A Minecraft Movie" grossed over $955 million worldwide, a figure that surpasses the combined box office of her last three films, underscoring the financial appeal of major studio blockbusters.</p>

          <p>During immigration raids in Los Angeles this summer, protesters targeted hotels where ICE and CBP agents were staying, leading the U.S. military to compile a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." Public records show that military officials sought to prevent their personnel from being "harassed" by activists who staged "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside the establishments. The documents, obtained by a government transparency group, suggest the protests were effective in disrupting the Trump administration's immigration operations. Activists view the military's response as confirmation that their strategy of pressuring hotels successfully hindered the federal agents' activities in the city.</p>

          <p>Jordan Cox and Sam Curran delivered spectacular half-centuries to power the Oval Invincibles to a stunning six-wicket victory over the Trent Rockets in The Hundred cricket tournament. Chasing a target of 172, the Invincibles were struggling before Cox and Curran launched an incredible counter-attack, scoring 103 runs from just 28 deliveries. Their explosive partnership included a 32-run, five-ball set that was the most expensive in the competition's history. The victory virtually secures a play-off spot for the two-time defending champions and solidifies their position as the team to beat in the tournament.</p>
