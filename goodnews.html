          <p>The White House has detailed a preliminary deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok, placing its American operations under a new U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members. Under the plan, tech firm Oracle will oversee all security operations, including the app's powerful content algorithm, to ensure it is not used for malicious purposes. A senior official stated the deal will not involve the U.S. government taking an equity stake or a "golden share" that would grant it veto power. The administration is confident that China has approved the framework, and President Trump is expected to sign an executive order extending the ban deadline to finalize the agreement.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel-Fattah became a symbol of the 2011 uprising and his detention, which the UN deemed arbitrary, drew international condemnation. The pardon, which also included five other individuals, followed a petition from a state-affiliated human rights council and a court decision to remove him from the country's terrorism list. The British government had repeatedly advocated for his release, and his mother recently ended a long hunger strike held to demand his freedom.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool for greater independence. The technology allows users to connect to the "Be My Eyes" app, which links them with volunteers who can help identify objects and navigate daily tasks in real time. Additionally, the glasses feature optical character recognition that can read text from menus, signs, and mail aloud. While users and advocates like the National Federation of the Blind praise the technology as a significant step forward, they also note it is still a work in progress with limitations like battery life and occasional inaccuracies.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Reduces Monthly Payments on Large Mortgages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 11:41:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has pushed the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate down to 6.13%, its lowest level in nearly three years. This shift provides significant savings for homebuyers, particularly those with large loans. For a $1 million mortgage, the current rate translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $6,079, which is about $600 less per month compared to the average rates seen in January 2025. Over the entire 30-year term, this difference could save a homeowner more than $200,000 in total interest costs, highlighting the substantial financial impact of borrowing at a lower rate.

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. more than doubled after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's stock surge, recommended it as his new pick. Jackson's firm, EMJ Capital, touted Better Home as "the Shopify of mortgages," suggesting it is revolutionizing the industry with artificial intelligence. He highlighted that the company trades at a significantly lower multiple than newly public competitor Figure Technology Solutions, despite growing faster. Jackson projected that Better Home could be a "potential 350-bagger in 2 years," causing the stock to leap to an intraday high of $94.06. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pfizer has announced a deal to acquire Metsera, a developer of obesity treatments, for up to $7.3 billion, as the pharmaceutical giant aims to secure a position in the rapidly growing weight-loss drug market. The acquisition follows setbacks in Pfizer's own development pipeline and addresses investor pressure to compete with successful drugs from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Metsera brings a portfolio of experimental oral and injectable treatments, including a GLP-1 drug that showed promising early-stage trial results. Analysts believe Metsera's candidates could generate over $5 billion in peak annual sales and will significantly accelerate Pfizer's entry into the lucrative market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn, has appointed Evelyn Palla as its new CEO to lead a new era focused on improving the notoriously unreliable train service. For years, the system has been plagued by delays, cancellations, and dilapidated infrastructure. The transport minister introduced Palla along with a revised, more realistic target of achieving 70% punctuality for long-distance trains by 2029, abandoning a previous, unachievable goal. The plan involves a multi-billion euro investment to completely renovate dozens of critical routes by 2036, addressing decades of underinvestment in the country's 33,500-kilometer rail network.</p>

          <p>The organizers of the World Conker Championships in Northamptonshire feared the event might be canceled due to a shortage of viable conkers. An unusually hot and dry summer caused horse chestnut trees to shed their nuts prematurely, before they could fully mature. However, after a public appeal for help, organizer Charles Whalley is now confident the event will proceed, having received offers of conker supplies from across the country. While this year's conkers will likely be smaller than average, preventative measures like freezing have been taken to preserve the available stock for the beloved annual contest.</p>

At one point, they feared they would be executed. Their release was secured through "good, old-fashioned diplomacy," with assistance from the government of Qatar. While detained, they were held in harsh conditions, including basement cells, and cuffed with violent criminals when taken to court.</p>

The initiative, named Operation Transom, was launched in 2023 to address growing resident concerns about illegal motorbikes racing through streets and damaging public spaces like parks and golf courses. The force utilizes drones, a fixed-wing plane, and its own off-road bikes to track and pursue offenders. In an effort to educate young people about the dangers, one of the seized bikes has been donated to a local college to be used as a practical teaching tool.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's recent match against Arsenal saw manager Pep Guardiola employ a surprisingly defensive approach, a radical departure from his signature possession-based style. City registered just 34% possession, the lowest ever for a Guardiola-led team, and finished the game with numerous defensive players on the pitch. This tactical shift has raised questions about whether Guardiola is adapting to a more physical, cautious trend in top-level football or if he lacks trust in his current squad's ability to dominate possession against elite opponents. The move stands in contrast to league-leading Liverpool, which has found success with a more aggressive, attack-focused strategy.</p>

She then hydrates with warm water and a pinch of salt to enhance cognitive response after overnight dehydration. Next, she gets a few minutes of natural morning light to set her body's internal clock, which she says supports better energy and sleep. Finally, she incorporates light physical movement to release dopamine and norepinephrine, boosting mood and sharpening focus for the hours ahead.</p>

          <p>The number of solopreneurs, or businesses with no paid employees, is rapidly growing in the U.S., contributing $1.7 trillion to the economy. Experts attribute this boom to lowered barriers to entry, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and the reach of social media platforms like TikTok. These technologies allow individuals to launch businesses quickly, create business plans, and connect with global customer bases that once required significant marketing budgets. The trend also reflects a broader shift in workforce values, with many prioritizing the flexibility, autonomy, and purpose that solopreneurship offers over traditional corporate career paths.</p>
