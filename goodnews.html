          <p>A federal district judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard and Marine troops in Los Angeles during immigration enforcement protests was illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling blocks the administration from using military personnel for tasks like arrests and crowd control within California. The judge stayed the injunction until September 12 to allow time for a potential appeal.</p>

He defeated two of the party's sitting MPs in the leadership contest, signaling a desire for a more radical direction among the party's membership. Polanski's platform includes strong support for a Universal Basic Income and nationalizing key utilities.</p>

The fast-food giant announced the return of deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal and an $8 Big Mac meal, starting September 8. This move comes after the company's CEO acknowledged a significant drop in traffic from low-income consumers, who have been cutting back on dining out. The focus on value aims to address sluggish sales, particularly during breakfast hours.</p>

          <p>Australian authorities have arrested and charged three Sydney dockworkers after discovering over 1,100 pounds of cocaine hidden in a shipping container. The drugs, with an estimated street value of $107 million, were concealed behind a false wall in a container that arrived from Europe. The arrests are part of a broader investigation by a multi-agency task force targeting "trusted insiders" within supply chains who facilitate organized crime. The accused men, two of whom were forklift drivers, face potential life sentences if convicted.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, banking experts suggest that now is an opportune time for savers to lock in currently high Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. As rates are likely to decline by the end of the year, securing a CD now could maximize returns. The article also discusses the benefits of no-penalty CDs for flexibility and CD laddering to balance access to funds with earning potential. Experts advise shopping around at different financial institutions to find the best available rates and terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Highlight Potential for 0% Capital Gains Tax Under New Trump Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:13:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. The 0% bracket applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 or married couples up to $96,700 for 2025. This article suggests this creates a window for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets are sold tax-free during lower-income years. This could be particularly beneficial for rebalancing portfolios or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:02:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark US legal case, an identical twin has been convicted of a crime based on subtle differences in his DNA. A jury found Russell Marubbio guilty of a sexual assault that occurred in Virginia in 1987, a cold case that was reopened using advanced genetic genealogy. Scientists at Parabon Nanolabs were able to identify minute somatic mutations that distinguish between the DNA of identical twins. This pioneering technique allowed investigators to definitively link Marubbio, rather than his brother, to the DNA evidence left at the crime scene nearly four decades ago.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has asserted that the company's future valuation will be overwhelmingly driven by its humanoid robot project, Optimus. In a social media post, he predicted that the robot will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's value, reiterating previous claims that Optimus could turn Tesla into a $25 trillion company. This focus on future AI-driven products like robots and robotaxis comes as Tesla faces a current sales slump due to increased competition and an aging electric vehicle lineup.

          <p>Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global, contends that the conventional investment model favoring public markets is "broken" and that private markets offer a better path for diversification and growth. He argues that public stock indexes are now dominated by a few mega-cap tech companies, reducing their effectiveness as a broad market investment. Rowan believes the historical view of private markets as risky and public ones as safe is outdated.

However, for those casually searching, waiting until after the Fed's decision could result in a more favorable rate. Experts stress the importance of personal financial situations, such as credit scores and budget flexibility, in making the right decision rather than trying to perfectly time the market.
