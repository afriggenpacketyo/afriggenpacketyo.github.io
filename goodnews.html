          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent women's rights symbol in France, has received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony about the decade of abuse she suffered, where her ex-husband drugged and sexually assaulted her, and invited others to do the same. Her case, which led to the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Singapore successfully avoided a technical recession, reporting 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 5.5% expansion in the manufacturing sector. Despite these positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The government has already downgraded its full-year GDP forecast and is rolling out grants to help businesses manage global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:16:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the job market continues to weaken. In an interview, Bailey stated he believes the path for rates, currently at 4.25%, is downward, citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and reducing pay increases. This follows a recent national insurance hike for employers and data showing the UK economy contracted in both April and May. The governor's comments suggest a proactive stance to stimulate the economy amid growing concerns about a potential slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different priorities than previous generations. He notes that today's travelers, often already well-traveled with their parents, are jaded with standard sightseeing and seek deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities. This shift from 'checklist' tourism to experiential travel is supported by studies showing younger generations are more willing to splurge on unique experiences. Ho also highlights the rise of 'rainbow tourism,' with travelers now coming from a diverse range of developing nations.</p>
