Experts remain cautious about whether this momentum will lead to broader dialogue on issues like military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation.

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, which charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, is showing early signs of success by reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit. Since its implementation, the policy has led to a decrease in vehicles entering the congestion zone, faster bus routes, and improved public transit ridership. However, the program has faced opposition, including potential revocation by the Trump administration and lawsuits from outside the city, raising concerns about its long-term viability and the precedent it sets for states' rights. Despite the challenges, the program is currently thriving and has gained acceptance among many residents.</p>

Instead of face-to-face interactions, relationships often begin and remain in the digital realm, characterized by ambiguous "talking stages" and situationships with unclear boundaries. Many young people express a desire for genuine connection and intimacy but struggle to navigate the confusing rules of modern romance, leading to emotional risk-aversion and a preference for the safety of online interactions. Despite the challenges, Gen Z teenagers still yearn for romance and meaningful relationships, even if they feel ill-equipped to pursue them.</p>

          <p>Richard Ellmann's biography of James Joyce, published in 1959, is examined for its impact on literary studies and its role in establishing Joyce as a canonical author. The article delves into Ellmann's meticulous research, his ability to bring Joyce's character to life, and his skillful weaving of biographical details with critical interpretations of Joyce's works. While Ellmann's approach has been critiqued for downplaying Joyce's political interests, his biography remains a landmark achievement, offering insights into Joyce's creative process and making his complex works accessible to a wider audience. The biography's enduring influence highlights a shift in literary studies towards specialization and single-author focus.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Hawaii are using drones to release live, male mosquitoes infected with a bacteria called wolbachia, which prevents the hatching of eggs when they mate with local females, to combat avian malaria. The non-native mosquito-borne disease is decimating the state's iconic forest birds, particularly honeycreepers, as climate change allows mosquitoes to move into higher elevations. The approach, known as the incompatible insect technique (IIT), aims to reduce the mosquito population and slow the spread of malaria without harming the local ecosystem. This method has been used for human health, and there is optimism it will help save the endangered bird species.</p>

They argue that women should not have to choose between family and professional fulfillment, and they criticize the "tradwife" movement for limiting women's potential. These voices often embrace progressive-leaning views on family policy, such as federal parental leave and remote work, while still maintaining conservative values. This shift reflects a practical calculation that supporting women's career aspirations may be necessary to raise fertility rates and discourage abortion.</p>
