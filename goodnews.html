          <p>On the tenth anniversary of nationwide marriage equality, a Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their pioneering legal battle. They were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage, a fight that, while unsuccessful in court, helped pave the way for eventual legalization in Maryland in 2012. The couple shared their story of facing obstacles as parents and their emotional wedding day, expressing both pride in the progress made and concern over new efforts to roll back LGBTQ rights. Their journey highlights the personal stakes of the fight for equality.</p>

          <p>A team of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has invented a specialized printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine capable of printing on plastic labels that commercial braille printers could not handle. The student-designed device features open hardware, making it accessible for BISM's blind and low-vision employees to operate. The invention has already been used to produce 400 labels for a charity beer, streamlining a previously manual process.</p>

Investor focus also shifted to potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with markets now pricing in a higher likelihood of three cuts by year-end.

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where women held significant power. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that men likely moved into their wives' households upon marriage, and female offspring remained in their birth homes. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal social structures in ancient societies.</p>

          <p>An ancient city was most likely ruled by females living in a "matriarchal society" more than 9,000 years ago, according to a study published in Science this week. Researchers extracted the ancient genomes of more than 130 skeletons from 35 different houses at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, an ancient city considered one of the most well-preserved Neolithic settlements in southern Anatolia in Turkey. About 395 skeletons, a mix of males and females, were found in grave pits under the floors of the city's mudbrick houses. Occupied for more than 1,000 years (9000 to 8000 BCE), the city was known for its female figurines, possible representatives of a "Mother Goddess" cult and signs of a matriarchal society. A team of geneticists, archaeologists, and biological anthropologists used cutting-edge technology to analyze the DNA of skeletons over 12 years and found that maternal lineage had a key role in connecting household members, as represented by burials within each building. During the early years in √áatalh√∂y√ºk, family members were buried together, but over time, habits changed, and researchers found many of the dead had no biological connection. Where there was a genetic connection, it was through the female line, suggesting husbands relocated to the wife's household upon marriage, researchers said. Using genetic sequencing, researchers estimated that 70 to 100% of the time, female offspring remained connected to buildings, whereas adult male offspring may have moved away. There was also a clear pattern of preferential treatment toward females, with findings showing five times more grave goods offered to females than to males. "We need to move away from our Western bias that assumes all societies are patrilineal. Many cultures, including some Indigenous Australian groups, pass identity, land rights, and responsibilities through the mother's line ‚Äî a matrilineal system," study co-author Dr. Eline Schotsmans, a research fellow at Australia's University of Wollongong's School of Science, said in a statement. These findings come several months after researchers studying social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion gathered genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery and found that women were closely related, while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage. Using an examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England, their study, published in the journal Nature, shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. This suggests that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, researchers said. Researchers said upon the release of their findings, "It is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities." contributed to this report.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. She sustained minor, non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. While the woman did not see what bit her, experts who analyzed photos of the wounds believe they are consistent with a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and officials will continue drone and lifeguard patrols to monitor the waters.</p>

The caller claimed to have seen the stranded cub along a remote stretch of Highway 166. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the unusual sighting, they discovered the animal in question was not a large feline but a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was then notified to handle the removal of the bird, leaving the reason for the zoological mix-up a mystery.</p>
