          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has not yet endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor. While praising Mamdani's successful campaign focus on the cost of living, Jeffries stated they do not know each other well and need to discuss Mamdani's vision for the city. Jeffries also noted that the nominee would need to clarify his positions on Israel and antisemitism to gain the trust of Jewish communities. The hesitation highlights potential ideological divides within the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article details how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a political shift that elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. The piece also explores how Buckley's intellectual and cultural politics paved the way for the modern Republican Party and, ultimately, the rise of figures like Newt Gingrich and Donald Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has significantly altered its proposed welfare reforms to avoid a large-scale rebellion from its own Labour backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that initial plans to cut Personal Independence Payment (Pip) had been mishandled, and concessions were made after substantial concerns were raised. Key changes include limiting Pip cuts to new claimants and allowing the health component of Universal Credit to rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a defeat for the Prime Minister.</p>

          <p>The upcoming film "Superman" aims to present a more "down-to-Earth" version of the iconic hero, according to director James Gunn and star David Corenswet. In a departure from portrayals of an indestructible character, this iteration will show Superman as vulnerable, lonely, and seeking connection with humanity. Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, embraces the challenge of playing a more relatable hero. The film, the first from the newly formed DC Studios, hopes to offer a fresh perspective on the classic character.</p>

          <p>British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk. The meeting was prompted by reports that Lotus's Chinese owner, Geely, was considering moving production to the U.S., a move that would have threatened 1,300 jobs. Production at the UK plant was recently paused due to U.S. tariffs, but is expected to resume as those tariffs are reduced. The government expressed its commitment to supporting the UK's automotive sector and was reassured of Lotus's dedication to its UK operations.</p>

Jack Draper, ranked fourth, leads the men's hopes, while Emma Raducanu returns as the British women's number one.

          <p>A new report from Vanguard shows a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 have a median balance nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The data indicates that despite economic uncertainty, Americans are continuing to save for retirement. The report also highlights the effectiveness of automatic enrollment in boosting savings, as participants in such plans have substantially higher balances than those who enroll voluntarily.
