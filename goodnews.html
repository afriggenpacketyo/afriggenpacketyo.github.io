          <h2>Arsenal Nears Completion of Deal for Sporting Striker Viktor Gyokeres</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 14:38:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting CP for a reported £63.5 million. While personal terms have been agreed upon, negotiations over the structure of add-on payments have slightly delayed the official announcement. The signing addresses manager Mikel Arteta's long-standing search for an elite center-forward to bolster his team's attack. Gyokeres has been in high demand after an exceptional season with Sporting, where he scored 54 goals in 52 games, and his arrival is seen as a significant move to help Arsenal compete for top honors in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has finalized a significant trade and military deal with the Philippines, though Manila has not yet confirmed the agreement. According to Trump's social media post, the deal includes a 19% tariff on Philippine goods imported into the U.S., while American goods will face no tariffs. The announcement followed a White House meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who cited the need to modernize his country's military due to regional tensions. This development is part of Trump's broader strategy of using tariff letters to negotiate what he considers new bilateral trade deals with various nations, aiming to create more favorable terms for the United States.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows a $20,000 CD Earns Less Interest Now Compared to a Year Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 14:35:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering a certificate of deposit (CD), a new analysis reveals that a $20,000 deposit earns substantially less interest today compared to the higher rates available one year ago. For example, a 3-year CD opened in 2024 at 5.75% would earn over $1,000 more than one opened in 2025 at a 4.15% rate. While the returns are still significant compared to the near-zero rates of the early 2020s, the decline highlights a shifting interest rate environment. The article suggests that with the potential for further rate cuts looming, the current moment may still represent a valuable opportunity for savers to lock in fixed, predictable returns before rates fall further.

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has officially identified the remains of U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Willis R. Hall, nearly 60 years after he was killed in action. Hall was one of 11 American soldiers who died when their remote radar site in Laos was attacked by Vietnamese commandos on March 11, 1968. His remains were unrecoverable at the time. After decades of efforts, including joint recovery operations with Laos and analysis of evidence found on the mountain, DPAA scientists used anthropological and DNA analysis to confirm his identity. Hall's family has been briefed, and he will be buried in Kansas, bringing long-awaited closure to his loved ones.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic cola sweetened with cane sugar for the U.S. market this fall. This move follows a social media post by President Trump claiming he had urged the company to make the switch from high-fructose corn syrup, which has been the standard sweetener in U.S. Coke since the 1980s. The company stated the new product is designed to expand consumer choice, complementing its existing portfolio. The cane-sugar-sweetened "Mexican Coke" has already gained a cult following in the U.S., suggesting a ready market for the new domestic version, which will be made with U.S.-produced cane sugar.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo is entering the growing market for functional beverages with the announcement of a new prebiotic cola set to launch this fall. The drink is designed to appeal to health-conscious consumers, containing prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and only 30 calories per serving, with no artificial sweeteners. This move comes shortly after PepsiCo's nearly $2 billion acquisition of Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand, signaling a strategic shift towards healthier alternatives. The launch reflects a broader industry trend where consumers are seeking out gut-healthy options, and PepsiCo aims to capture this demand without sacrificing the familiar taste of its flagship brand.</p>

          <p>A recently signed bill has created a new federal student loan repayment plan called the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), which will become available by July 2026. This income-driven repayment option calculates monthly payments on a sliding scale from 1% to 10% of a borrower's adjusted gross income, with a minimum payment of $10. Unlike previous plans, RAP offers loan forgiveness after 30 years, a longer timeline than the typical 20-25 years. As other repayment plans are phased out, RAP will become one of only two options for new borrowers, alongside the standard 10-year plan, significantly changing the landscape for future student debt management.

Badenoch stated the reshuffle aims to bring more experience to her top team as the party enters a "new phase." The changes also include new appointments for the shadow transport and health secretaries, as the party attempts to improve its standing after a difficult period with polls consistently placing them behind Labour and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old British man from Essex has been found guilty of attempting to spy for Russia under the UK's National Security Act. Howard Phillips offered to provide personal information about former Defence Secretary Sir Grant Shapps to individuals he believed were Russian intelligence agents. In reality, the agents were undercover British officers. Phillips, who his ex-wife said was "infatuated" with espionage and dreamed of being like James Bond, met with the officers and offered his "100% loyalty and dedication" to a foreign power. His conviction highlights ongoing counter-espionage efforts by UK authorities to address threats from hostile states and protect national security.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of working Americans with a side hustle is shrinking, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report shows that 27% of workers have a second income stream, a significant drop from 36% in 2024 and the lowest level recorded since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and several years of wage growth outpacing inflation, which has eased some economic pressure on households. This shift suggests that fewer people feel the need to take on extra work to cover basic living expenses, a contrast to the post-pandemic period when side hustles peaked amid record-high inflation.

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, has successfully campaigned for the fitness company to create more inclusive age categories for its oldest riders.

In response to her persistence, Peloton has now added new 90-plus and 100-plus age groups, allowing senior athletes to compete more fairly with their peers. Dorion's story is a testament to her lifelong commitment to fitness and her belief that one should never give up on advocating for what is right.</p>
