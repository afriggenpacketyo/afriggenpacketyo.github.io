          <p>A U.S. District Judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling the move was unlawful. The judge's order stated that the administration used allegations of antisemitism on campus as a "smokescreen" to arbitrarily terminate grants based on political motivations. While the ruling is a victory for Harvard, the judge also noted that the university should have done more to address the issue of antisemitism, which she described as a real problem on campus.</p>

The proposed legislation combines several previous proposals and has garnered support from across the political spectrum, reflecting growing public pressure to address potential conflicts of interest. Supporters argue the measure is crucial for restoring public faith in government, while some opponents claim it could deter experienced individuals from the private sector from seeking public office.</p>

The DOJ had sued the state to invalidate registrations that lacked a driver’s license or partial social security number. Following intervention by the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups, a proposed consent order will now allow these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchising them.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have uncovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, a bizarre ankylosaur that lived over 165 million years ago, revealing it was far more armored than previously known. The car-sized herbivore possessed an array of spikes across its body, including meter-long spikes on its neck and ribs fused with outward-projecting barbs—a feature never seen before in any vertebrate. The discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these complex armor systems, likely used for defense and display, developed much earlier than scientists believed.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for New York state, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing can be used as evidence in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer. This is the first time such cutting-edge whole genome sequencing from degraded hair samples will be permitted in a New York court, setting a major legal precedent. Prosecutors consider the ruling a significant victory, as the technology linked Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on multiple victims, though the defense immediately challenged the decision.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.4 billion, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize. Due to varying state income tax laws, a winner in a no-tax state like Florida or Texas would receive a much larger payout than a winner in a high-tax state like New York. The article also breaks down the odds of winning (1 in 292.2 million) and identifies the most and least frequently drawn numbers in recent drawings, providing context for players ahead of the next drawing.
