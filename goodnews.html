          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a significant milestone in underwater communication. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system that maps signal clusters in noisy environments without prior knowledge of seabed topography. This advancement could pave the way for the real-life use of long-range undersea messaging, with profound civilian and military applications.

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more than most of their global counterparts, averaging 1.8 days a week of remote work. Hybrid working has become the dominant model in advanced economies, particularly in English-speaking countries. The popularity of home working in the UK is attributed to the cost and length of commuting. While some companies have introduced strict return-to-office mandates, home working levels have stabilized in the UK since 2023. The study also finds that men and women work from home at similar rates, with a stronger preference for hybrid work among parents and for office work among younger employees.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Evolutionary biologist Yara Haridy and her colleagues found that the anatomy of ancient invertebrate armor resembled the teeth of vertebrates. By scanning fossilized bumps and analyzing the tooth-like scales of modern-day fish embryos, they discovered nerves, suggesting that ancient fish used their armor to sense the water around them. The article explores the evolutionary origins of tooth sensitivity and the surprising connections between ancient creatures and modern-day humans.</p>
