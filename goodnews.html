This partnership will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and enable JetBlue customers to earn frequent flyer miles on United, with reciprocal loyalty benefits. The deal, subject to regulatory review, aims to provide travelers with more choices and value across both airlines' networks. This collaboration differs from JetBlue's previous alliance with American Airlines, which was blocked on antitrust grounds, and the airline's failed attempt to acquire Spirit Airlines.</p>

Democrats are criticizing the bill, predicting Medicaid cuts will cost Republicans seats in the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans argue the bill does not cut Medicaid for the most vulnerable but targets benefits for illegal immigrants, ineligible recipients, and able-bodied adults not working. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that 8.6 million people will lose health insurance by 2034 due to the reform. (not investment advice)</p>
