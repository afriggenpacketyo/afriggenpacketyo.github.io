        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid parliamentary deadlock in France, remembrance politics have gained traction with initiatives addressing historical injustices. The National Assembly voted to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus to brigadier general, recognizing his wrongful conviction and subsequent exoneration. Additionally, a law was passed to compensate returnees from French Indochina who faced harsh conditions in temporary camps after the end of colonial rule. Furthermore, the Assembly adopted a resolution addressing Haiti's "double debt" to France, calling for recognition, repayment, and reparations for the economic burden imposed on Haiti after its independence. While some view these initiatives as social maturity, others see them as symbolic gestures in a politically paralyzed legislature.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir David Attenborough expressed his dismay to Prince William regarding the destructive impact of certain fishing methods on ocean floors, particularly bottom trawling, during an interview conducted at the premiere of his new documentary, Ocean. This interview preceded a key UN Oceans conference in Nice, where global leaders will discuss ocean protection amidst threats from plastic pollution, climate change, and over-exploitation. Attenborough emphasized the critical role oceans play in sustaining planetary life and hopes the conference will underscore their importance to global citizens. The UN aims to secure ratification of the High Seas Treaty by 60 countries, which would protect 30% of the ocean by 2030, though concerns remain about the effectiveness of MPAs if bottom trawling continues within them.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf, who resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party to lead its "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Yusuf initially cited that working to get the party elected was no longer "a good use of my time," before quickly regretting his decision. Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will now take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media for the party. Yusuf explained his earlier departure as a decision born of exhaustion after 11 months of building the party from scratch.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist, Dr. Andrew Freeman, recommends oatmeal as his go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it lower in calories, and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal is high in minerals, vitamins, and beta-glucan, which helps maintain healthy cholesterol and blood glucose levels. Dr. Freeman also advises against consuming eggs and processed pastries for breakfast due to their high cholesterol, fat, and sugar content.</p>

Merz's approach to Germany's policy toward Israel marks a significant shift, as he openly criticized Israel's actions in the Gaza war, a stance that former Chancellor Scholz avoided. This change in tone raises questions about the extent of Germany's commitment to Israel's security. While practical changes may be limited, the shift in style suggests a new direction in German politics.</p>
