          <h2>Trump Announces Framework of U.K. Trade Deal with Tariffs Remaining on Some Items</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump unveiled the broad terms of a trade deal with the U.K., potentially easing the impact of tariffs and providing a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal aims to increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, including agricultural products, and reduce non-tariff barriers. While a 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate, with additional vehicles facing higher tariffs. Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Developed nations are recognizing the need to diversify tungsten supply sources after China restricted exports, causing panic in the industry. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list, impacting industries like defense. US defense contractors face a deadline to stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027. Tungsten is crucial for cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies. China dominates global tungsten ore mining, with the US lacking commercial mining for a decade.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports, in return for arrangements such as allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff. While a 10 percent baseline tariff imposed in April remains, the United States will remove additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum. This deal signals that Trump intends to maintain the 10 percent universal tariff, with only the country-specific part of his so-called reciprocal tariffs being negotiable.</p>
