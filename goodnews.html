          <p>Japan's top tariff negotiator is planning a trip to the United States to continue ministerial-level talks aimed at securing concessions on tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. This marks the sixth round of such discussions, highlighting the ongoing efforts to address trade imbalances between the two countries.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in Pediatrics reveals that teen skin care routines promoted on TikTok often involve elaborate and potentially harmful products. Researchers analyzed 100 TikTok videos and found that the average routine contained 11 active ingredients, many of which could cause skin allergies and increased sun sensitivity. The average cost of these routines was around $168 per month, raising concerns about unrealistic beauty standards and the influence of social media on young people. Dermatologists recommend simple routines with gentle cleansers, moisturizers, and sunscreen for children under 18.</p>
