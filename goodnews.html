          <h2>UK to Extend Statutory Bereavement Leave to Cover Miscarriage at Any Stage</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government is set to change the law to provide statutory bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage at any point during pregnancy. Currently, this legal right is only available for pregnancy loss that occurs after 24 weeks. The amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will ensure that parents have a legal right to take time off work to grieve, a move welcomed by campaigners and the Miscarriage Association as a significant acknowledgment of pre-24-week loss.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to offer tax-free payments of £4,500 to attract and retain qualified early years teachers in 20 of England's most disadvantaged areas. This incentive is a key component of a £1.5 billion 'Best Start in Life' strategy, which aims to elevate educational standards and reduce the achievement gap among preschool children. The initiative, announced by Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, also includes provisions for more frequent Ofsted inspections of nurseries.</p>

Dunham also touches on learning from past controversies, stating that she has developed a greater understanding of the need to take time and space for herself.</p>
