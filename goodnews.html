          <p>An article discusses how to identify and manage friendships with 'energy vampires' – individuals who drain your emotional and mental energy. These friends often monopolize conversations, complain excessively, or offer backhanded compliments, leaving you feeling depleted. Psychologists and journalists suggest common signs include an excessive need for attention and a lack of interest in your life. To handle such dynamics, the article advises open communication about unmet needs, setting clear boundaries on time and topics, and trying different activities like walks or exercise to shift the focus from intense emotional sharing, helping to protect your well-being.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations to become a hub for green marine fuels hinge on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has made progress with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a reliable upstream-to-downstream network, including tax-free imports from mainland China. Wang highlighted this during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. Despite green methanol costing four times more, its usage is expected to increase from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has achieved a decisive victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections crucial for the country's path to the EU. Sandu had warned of 'massive Russian interference,' with bomb scares reported at polling stations and arrests made over alleged plots of unrest. Despite claims of victory by pro-Russian opposition leader Igor Dodon before results, Sandu's party secured a clear majority. The election outcome reinforces Moldova's European trajectory, though challenges like spiraling prices, corruption, and Russian influence in Transnistria persist.</p>

          <p>The growing popularity of weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro is raising concerns that obesity management could become a wealth issue, deepening health inequalities. While some of these drugs are NHS-prescribed, access is tightly restricted by varying regional eligibility thresholds, creating a 'postcode lottery.' Consequently, over 90% of the estimated 1.5 million UK users pay privately, with monthly costs ranging from £100-£350, a sum out of reach for many, particularly in deprived areas where obesity rates are higher. Experts fear that without broader NHS access and investment in prevention, health disparities will worsen, making good health a luxury.</p>
