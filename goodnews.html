          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong growth, with exports climbing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% compared to the previous year, beating economists' forecasts. This performance has provided significant support to the nation's economy amid ongoing trade tensions and a potential tariff truce with the U.S. nearing its deadline. Despite the positive trade figures, China's factory activity recently slowed, indicating that the momentum from businesses front-loading shipments may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging test flight on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The mission experienced several technical issues, forcing Wilmore and his crewmate Suni Williams to remain on the International Space Station for over nine months, far longer than the planned eight days. Despite the troubles, Wilmore consistently maintained that he was prepared for the risks associated with a test mission and expressed confidence that the spacecraft's issues would be resolved.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to crack down on the non-surgical cosmetic industry by introducing a new licensing scheme for practitioners. Under the proposals, clinics offering treatments like Botox and dermal fillers will need to meet strict safety and training standards to obtain a license. Furthermore, the most high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only, aiming to protect the public from harm and exploitation.</p>
