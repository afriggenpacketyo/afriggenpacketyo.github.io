          <p>Ryan Garc√≠a's year-long hiatus from boxing proved detrimental as he suffered a defeat against Rolando Romero in New York. Garc√≠a, visibly lacking his usual spark and punch volume, struggled after being knocked down in the second round, ultimately losing by unanimous decision. Romero capitalized on Garc√≠a's cautious approach, securing the WBA welterweight title. Garc√≠a acknowledged the impact of his inactivity and mental struggles, while Romero expressed his ambition to face any opponent at 147 pounds, emphasizing his pursuit of championships over monetary gains. </p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic pressures and a complex geopolitical landscape. Voters are concerned about the rising cost of living and housing affordability, despite Australia's reputation as a stable, prosperous nation. The election pits Prime Minister Anthony Albanese against opposition leader Peter Dutton, with both offering measures to address economic concerns. The election also reflects a shift away from major parties, with voters increasingly turning to independent candidates, and the failure of a referendum to enshrine Indigenous rights in Parliament, and the association of one of the candidates with President Trump's policies, impacting voter sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar against the US dollar, driven by increased demand related to equity investments.

This action comes ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts are expected, which could further increase capital inflow into Hong Kong.

          <p>Saturday's British newspapers are dominated by two main stories: Reform UK's impact on local elections and Prince Harry's BBC interview. Reform UK's gains have sent shockwaves through the political establishment, while Prince Harry discusses his strained relationship with the royal family and concerns about his father's health. The Prime Minister acknowledged voters weren't feeling the benefits of his policies, while other papers highlighted Reform UK's pledges to cut local authority spending and stop council employees from working from home. The interview with Prince Harry included his reflections on losing an appeal over his security in the UK.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. While President Trump eased the measure in response to business concerns, the tariff aims to encourage carmakers to increase manufacturing in the US. However, analysts predict that any immediate expansions in the US will likely come at the expense of production elsewhere, while also leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Some car companies have already warned of increased costs due to the tariffs, while others have withdrawn financial guidance for the year ahead, citing the uncertainty of the situation.</p>

          <p>The elimination of tariff exemptions for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is affecting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. The expansion of tariff-free shipments had enabled the rise of low-cost online retailers like Temu and Shein, which heavily invested in digital advertising. President Trump's decision to eliminate the exemption for goods valued at less than $800 has led to reduced advertising spending by these companies. Temu has already stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, and Shein has not yet responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <h2>Denver Fire Station 3: A Legacy of Black Firefighters</h2>

          <p>Denver Fire Station 3, the city's oldest serving firehouse, holds a significant place in history as the station where Denver's first Black firefighters were assigned. Until desegregation in 1957, it was the only station for Black firefighters. The standards set at Station 3, known as the 'Pride of the Points,' had a profound impact across Denver, and Black firefighters served the community while overcoming racial hurdles. Their contributions to the fire service span over a hundred years, and there's a need to continue addressing areas to ensure equitable service to the community.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Strikes Down Trump Order Targeting Law Firm Perkins Coie</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:44:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the American legal system. The ruling permanently blocks the order, which imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients Trump dislikes. Judge Howell framed the targeting of Perkins as an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The executive order suspended security clearances for the firm's employees, barred its attorneys from access to government buildings and officials, and ended government contracts with the firm.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Backtracks on Renaming Veterans Day</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 21:31:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has clarified that President Donald Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was incorrect, stating it will be an additional proclamation and not a full replacement. Trump also intended to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or observance requires congressional approval. The clarification follows criticism and confusion regarding the initial announcement.</p>
