          <h2>Therapy Culture Linked to Generational Childlessness, Essay Argues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-30 16:59:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York Times opinion piece explores the potential link between the rise of therapy culture and increasing childlessness among millennials and Gen Z. The author suggests that heightened awareness of childhood trauma and the emphasis on emotional well-being have contributed to an elevated, possibly unattainable, standard for parenting. This generation may be hesitant to become parents themselves, fearing they will not meet these standards and potentially inflict harm on their children, while societal factors such as economic pressures and climate change concerns also play a role. The essay highlights how redefined notions of harm and abuse have influenced perspectives on parenthood.</p>

          <p>Loretta Swit, best known for her role as Major Margaret "Hot Lips" Houlihan on the TV series M*A*S*H, has died at the age of 87 in her New York home, with her representative citing natural causes as the likely reason. Swit garnered two Emmy Awards and multiple nominations for her portrayal of the Army nurse in the Korean War-era comedy, which ran for 11 seasons. She sought to bring depth to her character, moving beyond the "Hot Lips" moniker and exploring Houlihan's evolving personality as the show progressed. Swit's career spanned both stage and screen, but it was her role on M*A*S*H that solidified her legacy in television history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a rally at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, a week after suggesting he approved a controversial merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. Investors and union members are keenly awaiting details about the structure of the deal, which Trump has described as a "partnership." While U.S. Steel has portrayed the agreement as a merger, where it becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, questions remain about how the deal will be structured and how U.S. interests will be protected. Pennsylvania Senator Dave McCormick has indicated that the U.S. government will have a "golden share" to ensure U.S. control and production levels.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article argues that denying visas to Chinese students, particularly those pursuing STEM degrees, could ultimately backfire on the United States. While protecting borders from espionage is essential, the article suggests that blanket denials based on nationality could hinder American innovation and competitiveness. By limiting access to talented individuals from China, the U.S. may miss out on valuable contributions to its scientific and technological advancements. The piece emphasizes the importance of striking a balance between national security concerns and fostering an environment that attracts and retains global talent.</p>

          <p>Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin signed a bill into law that restricts cellphone use for all public elementary, middle, and high school students in the state. The law aims to reduce distractions and disruptions in the classroom, building upon Youngkin's previous executive order on cellphone-free education policies. Research suggests that cellphone use in classrooms can negatively impact students' grades, social skills, emotional development, and mental health. The legislation requires school boards to develop policies to limit cellphone use during the school day, with exceptions for students with specific educational or health needs.</p>

While DOGE's cost-cutting efforts have reportedly saved around $170 billion, some analyses suggest the initiative could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and other factors. Musk, who wore a DOGE baseball cap and "DOGEfather" t-shirt, will continue to serve as an advisor to the president.

          <p>Costco reported strong third-quarter results, with net sales increasing by 8% to $61.96 billion and earnings per share rising to $4.28. Analysts attribute Costco's success to its ability to absorb tariff and inflation pressures due to its scale, resulting in an 8.1% increase in adjusted comparable sales. The company's performance has led to positive reactions from analysts, with some suggesting a potential stock split. Costco's ability to pass through costs without affecting traffic highlights the strength of its membership model and positions it for continued market share gains, even amidst a challenging consumer environment.

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times discusses Elon Musk's departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and the need for further fiscal changes. While DOGE identified approximately $175 billion in savings, the contributor argues that more is needed to address America's soaring deficits and national debt. The author emphasizes the importance of Congress enacting the DOGE cuts into law and calls for entitlement program reforms, particularly Medicare and Social Security. The contributor suggests that both Republicans and Democrats must work together to address these challenges, highlighting the need for bipartisan cooperation on fiscal policy.</p>

          <p>The remains of 19 Black New Orleanians, whose skulls were dismembered and shipped to Germany in the late 1800s for racist research, are being returned to New Orleans for memorialization and burial. The skulls were sent to Leipzig University for research aimed at proving the debunked theory that Black people's brains were smaller than those of other races. After failing to locate any descendants, the city of New Orleans will hold a memorial and jazz funeral before laying the remains to rest at the Hurricane Katrina Memorial. The event is intended to honor the victims and confront a dark chapter in medical and scientific history.</p>
