          <p>The Supreme Court has granted a temporary injunction, restoring Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby's right to vote in the state house after she was censured for a controversial social media post about a transgender student athlete. The post included the student's name and photo, leading to concerns about safety and privacy after Libby refused to remove it. The Maine House stripped Libby of her voting rights, prompting a lawsuit arguing that her punishment silenced her constituents. Justice Jackson dissented, criticizing the Court's increasing use of the 'shadow docket' for emergency rulings, but the majority sided with Libby, raising First Amendment concerns over the censure.

          <p>President Trump has unveiled plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense system, designed to protect the United States from foreign missile threats, drawing inspiration from Israel's Iron Dome. The project is estimated to cost $175 billion, with an initial $25 billion allocated to begin construction, and aims to integrate advanced technologies across land, sea, and space, including space-based sensors and interceptors. The system is projected to be fully operational before the end of Trump's term in 2029, with construction planned in states including Alaska, Florida, Georgia, and Indiana. The announcement follows a Pentagon intelligence assessment warning of increasing missile threats from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating a federal law mandating that truck drivers must be proficient in English to ensure roadway safety. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy signed an order directing the Department of Transportation to enforce the law, emphasizing that it prioritizes public safety over political correctness. The move follows President Trump's executive order requiring English literacy tests for truckers, addressing communication issues between drivers and officials. Secretary Duffy stated that drivers unable to read stop signs or understand instructions pose a threat to all Americans on the road, leading to immediate removal from service for non-compliant truckers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of Walmart for blaming tariffs on impending price increases has sparked debate among economists about corporate responsibility. While mainstream economists argue companies must pass along the cost of tariffs, populist thinkers suggest corporations have more pricing power than acknowledged. The debate centers on whether companies should absorb tariff costs to protect consumers or if raising prices is an inevitable response. Some argue large companies could mitigate price increases by accepting lower margins or shifting supply chains, while others suggest companies exploit inflation concerns to manipulate prices.

This partnership positions Warby Parker as a competitor to the Meta-EssilorLuxottica alliance, known for Ray-Ban smart glasses. Google's return to the glasses market follows the launch of Google Glass in 2013, which raised privacy concerns. The partnership also involves collaborations with developers and device makers, including Samsung, Qualcomm, and Sony.</p>

          <p>A recycling plant in South L.A. accused of emitting toxic waste onto Jordan High School will be permanently closed under a plea deal. The plant's owners, Matthew and Gary Weisenberg, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor and felony charges, agreeing to pay fines and restitution totaling over $1 million. The agreement also prohibits the Weisenbergs from operating a metal processing or recycling facility on the property. The closure follows years of allegations from community activists and school officials about the plant's harmful emissions, including explosions, metal projectiles, and elevated lead levels.</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Halts Temecula School District's Ban on Critical Race Theory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 15:58:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California appeals court has temporarily blocked the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory, citing concerns that the policy is unconstitutionally vague and intimidates teachers. The court found that the district's definition of CRT was subjective and lacked clarity, leading to anxiety and self-censorship among teachers. The ruling reverses a lower court's decision and underscores the legal challenges to policies restricting discussions on race and inequality in schools. The Trump administration has similar policies regarding critical race theory, but state law and court decisions are taking precedence.</p>
