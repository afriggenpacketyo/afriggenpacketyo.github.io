          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a recent phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump as "very important and fruitful," focusing on strengthening Ukraine's air defenses and potential joint weapons production. Trump confirmed the "very strategic call," expressing his disappointment with a separate conversation with Russian President Putin, whom he believes is not seeking to end the conflict. The discussion also touched upon the possible sale of more Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, which Trump indicated he is considering to help the nation defend itself against intensified Russian airstrikes. Both leaders agreed to have their teams meet for further detailed talks on defense and diplomatic cooperation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived as a monument to the end of slavery in the United States, not as a beacon for immigrants. This historical context is often overlooked in favor of its modern interpretation, which was largely shaped by Emma Lazarus's poem "The New Colossus." The statue's meaning transformed with the opening of Ellis Island and the passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, which ended restrictive ethnic quotas. This evolution turned Lady Liberty into a powerful "mother of exiles," a symbol of promise and hope for millions seeking refuge and a new life in America.</p>

          <p>While geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China persist at the national level, many American local governments continue to welcome Chinese investment to stimulate their economies. According to the China General Chamber of Commerce, city leaders, particularly in the Midwest, are actively seeking Chinese-invested manufacturing projects to create jobs and economic growth. This local-level receptiveness contrasts sharply with the rhetoric from national politicians, creating a complex landscape for Chinese companies. These firms are weighing the economic opportunities in the U.S. market against the risks posed by the broader political climate.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive coach and human behavior expert warns that certain common phrases can unintentionally make a person seem judgmental, potentially damaging professional and personal relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can come across as dismissive or condescending, even when the speaker's intent is to be helpful or correct. The article suggests alternative wording that promotes curiosity, collaboration, and humility. For instance, instead of offering an immediate solution, one could ask, "What have you tried so far?" to show empathy before providing advice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political and economic footprint in the Western Balkans, using a strategy described as "infrastructure imperialism." This involves funding major projects like the Namazgah mosque in Albania, which serves as a tool of soft power, alongside investments in railways, ports, and hotels across the region. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan positions Turkey as the heir to the Ottoman Empire, using historical and religious ties to build a sphere of influence. This approach aims to project Turkey as a modern regional power, extending its reach from the Balkans to Central Asia and Africa.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal came ashore in South Carolina early Sunday, bringing maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and threatening heavy rainfall across the Carolinas. The National Hurricane Center issued tropical storm warnings for the coast from the South Santee River, South Carolina, to Surf City, North Carolina. Forecasters predict the storm will produce two to four inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to six inches, creating a risk of flash flooding as it moves inland. The storm is expected to weaken rapidly now that it has made landfall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite hyperbolic predictions of either a "golden age" or an "economic catastrophe," the U.S. economy has remained remarkably stable five months into President Trump's second term. Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not shifted dramatically, and GDP growth continues at a modest pace. Trump's most aggressive tariff policies were quickly moderated, preventing a major trade war, while his other economic promises have had little immediate effect. However, consumer sentiment remains low, and long-term policies like reduced research funding and a war on renewable energy could pose future risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FIFA has dramatically slashed ticket prices for the Club World Cup semi-final match between Chelsea and Fluminense at MetLife Stadium. Standard tickets, which were priced as high as $473.90, were reduced to just $13.40. This move is part of a dynamic pricing strategy used for the tournament and follows similar price drops for quarter-final matches in other cities. In contrast, tickets for the other semi-final between Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid remain significantly higher, starting at nearly $200, suggesting a response to demand for specific matches.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has finalized the signing of Spanish international midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee of nearly £60 million. The 26-year-old, who has signed a five-year contract, is the club's second major summer acquisition. Zubimendi, a key player for both his former club and the Spanish national team, was a long-term target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, who values his passing ability and football intelligence. The deal was reportedly secured last summer, with Arsenal successfully warding off interest from other top clubs, including Liverpool and Real Madrid.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent New York City mayoral primary serves as a powerful case study for the benefits of ranked-choice voting (RCV). The system allowed a little-known progressive candidate, Zohran Mamdani, to rise from 1% in early polls to become the Democratic nominee. RCV incentivized a more positive, coalition-building campaign, where candidates cross-endorsed each other and focused on issues rather than negative attacks. This led to historic voter turnout and high voter satisfaction, demonstrating that RCV can empower voters, increase choice, and foster a more engaging and less polarized political environment.</p>

          <p>The American flag and symbols of patriotism hold a complicated meaning for many Black Americans, a relationship that is being newly explored by prominent artists like Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar. For generations, the flag has represented both the nation's founding ideals and the systemic oppression enacted under it, creating a deep ambivalence. This article explores how the relationship is evolving, with some Black Americans reclaiming the flag as a symbol of their ancestors' contributions and their rightful place in the nation. This reclamation is a signal that "this is home," while still acknowledging the country's racial injustices and the long road to true equality.</p>
