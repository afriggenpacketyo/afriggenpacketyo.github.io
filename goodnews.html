          <p>Former NFL quarterback Michael Vick has publicly dismissed speculation that he is a candidate for the head coaching position at his alma mater, Virginia Tech, following the dismissal of Brent Pry. Vick, currently in his first season as head coach for Norfolk State, emphasized that his complete focus remains on his current team and their upcoming game against Sacred Heart. He urged his players to ignore media rumors, reinforcing his commitment to the task at hand rather than potential future opportunities in his coaching career.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, establishing a company valuation of $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of its previously announced range and marks the culmination of a multi-year effort to go public, which faced delays due to market volatility. The company, which will trade on the NYSE under the symbol "STUB," reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue but also a widening net loss compared to the previous year.

          <p>Strong winds in Washington state have stirred up volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, causing hazy conditions and diminished air quality in the region. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, is occurring due to persistently dry weather and severe drought conditions. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that this is not a new eruption, but they have warned that the airborne ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant shift in strategy under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the previous season's attack-focused approach. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. While the team's defense was praised for not allowing a single shot on target, the pragmatic style resulted in limited offensive excitement, with Spurs only registering one shot on target themselves.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has officially announced his campaign for a third consecutive term, a feat no governor has achieved in the state's 167-year history. In his announcement, the Democrat highlighted his administration's progressive policy achievements while acknowledging recent challenges, including high-profile gun violence. Walz, who was Kamala Harris's running mate in the 2024 presidential election, faces political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose a third term and scrutiny over his administration's handling of a major fraud case.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini has claimed the number one spot for free applications on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT. This surge in popularity follows recent updates to Gemini, including a new image editing feature called Nano Banana, which reportedly attracted 13 million new users in just four days. The achievement signals that Google is gaining significant ground in the consumer generative AI race, a development that has also drawn positive attention from investors, contributing to Alphabet's recent entry into the $3 trillion market valuation club.</p>

Analysts attribute this shift primarily to persistent inflation, which has eroded the savings of many households and increased the cost of essentials.
