          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting Ximena Arias Cristobal, an undocumented college student, on May 5th. The officer pulled Arias Cristobal over for an improper turn and driving without a license, leading to her detention by ICE. However, after reviewing dashcam footage, officials dismissed the charges on May 12th, realizing the mistake. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE custody on bond on May 22nd, and faces deportation proceedings along with her father, who was also detained by ICE after a traffic stop in April. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that both should face consequences for being in the U.S. illegally.</p>

          <p>Stuttgart secured their fourth German Cup title by defeating third division champions Arminia Bielefeld 4-2 in the final at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. Despite a late scare from Bielefeld, who scored twice in the last 10 minutes, Stuttgart held on to win the trophy for the first time since 1997. Bielefeld, who had an impressive run to the final, overcame four Bundesliga sides, but ultimately fell short. Stuttgart's success comes after years of struggling, with the team having appointed Sebastian Hoeness as coach in April 2023, leading them to a second-place finish in the Bundesliga and a Champions League spot.</p>

          <p>French authorities suspect arson may have caused a major power outage in southeast France, threatening the Cannes Film Festival's closing celebrations. Power was restored hours before the ceremony, but investigations are ongoing into a fire at an electrical substation and a collapsed high-voltage line. About 160,000 households in the Alpes-Maritimes area lost electricity, disrupting traffic and closing shops. Cannes Film Festival organizers confirmed the outage affected early activities but assured that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, using an independent power supply.</p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. About 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas lost power early on Saturday, before supply was restored in the afternoon. Officials said an electricity substation had been set on fire and a pylon at another location damaged. Organisers of the international film festival say the closing ceremony will go ahead as planned as they have an alternative power supply.</p>

          <p>Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years. The ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama "Sentimental Value," and Kleber Mendon√ßa Filho's Brazilian political thriller "The Secret Agent" won two big awards.</p>

          <p>DMVs across the country are warning drivers about a new batch of fake, phishing text messages designed to scam respondents out of their personal and financial information. The messages warn drivers of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threaten steep penalties, including additional fines and suspension of driving privileges if the reader does not comply. These phishing scams by text, otherwise known as "smishing," or SMS phishing, have been on the rise in recent months. Experts advise registering phone numbers to the National Do Not Call Registry, avoiding clicking links from unknown numbers, and remaining skeptical when personal information is requested.</p>
