        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asian longhorned tick, an invasive species, has been identified in Maine for the first time, marking its farthest northeastern spread in the United States since its initial discovery in 2017. This tick poses a serious threat to livestock and can transmit diseases like Rocky Mountain spotted fever to humans. A unique danger of this species is that females can reproduce asexually, allowing a single tick to rapidly create a large infestation. Officials are emphasizing the importance of surveillance and advise the public to take precautions by checking for ticks after being outdoors and using appropriate repellants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with large cash reserves, deciding between opening a single jumbo CD or multiple standard CDs in a laddering strategy presents a key choice. Experts note that while jumbo CDs, typically requiring a $100,000 minimum deposit, used to offer higher rates, the current inverted yield curve means shorter-term standard CDs can be just as competitive. The decision hinges on balancing the simplicity of a single jumbo CD against the flexibility of a CD ladder, which allows for staggered access to funds. Savers should also consider FDIC insurance limits, which cap coverage at $250,000 per depositor per institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, the contest to find her successor is now underway. Candidates have until Thursday to secure the backing of at least 80 Labour Members of Parliament to get on the ballot. Prominent figures who have announced their candidacy include Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, who is seen as a unifying figure, and former shadow cabinet minister Emily Thornberry, who has been critical of some government policies. The new deputy leader will ultimately be chosen by a vote of the party's membership, with the result expected on October 25.</p>

          <h2>CEO Shares Three Subtle Red Flags to Avoid in Job Interviews</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a CEO who has conducted over 500 interviews, there are three subtle behaviors from candidates that signal major red flags to hiring managers. The first is tardiness, even by a minute, as it suggests poor planning and a lack of respect for time. The second is giving generic, theoretical answers instead of specific examples rooted in personal experience, which fails to demonstrate proven skills. The final red flag is low energy or a lack of engagement, as the interview is considered a candidate's best-case performance, and disinterest at this stage predicts poor performance on the job.</p>

          <p>A Philadelphia Phillies fan went viral after he caught a home run ball for his nine-year-old son, only to hand it over to a woman who loudly and persistently insisted it was hers. The father, Drew Feltwell, explained that he made the choice to de-escalate the tense situation and teach his son a lesson rather than engage in a public conflict. Although his son was initially disappointed, the family's story had a happy ending: they were visited by team representatives and met player Harrison Bader, who gave the boy a signed bat and other souvenirs.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a decades-long ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar living in camps along the border. This policy change comes in response to severe funding cuts for humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which left many refugees facing food shortages. The move is seen as a pragmatic solution to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially helping to fill labor shortages in Thailand. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a potential regional benchmark for rights-based refugee solutions.</p>

The CEO described the approach as the "democratization of fine dining," aiming to provide high-quality, innovative items at a price point around $11, which is significantly lower than what a similar burger might cost at a full-service restaurant.
