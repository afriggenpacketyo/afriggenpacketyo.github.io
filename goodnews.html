          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla signed a substantial $16.5 billion contract with Samsung Electronics for the supply of semiconductors, as revealed in a regulatory filing and Musk's social media posts. The agreement, effective July 2025 through 2033, designates Samsung's new Texas fabrication plant to produce Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, a move Musk described as strategically vital. While Samsung's filing initially kept the counterparty secret, Musk's confirmation and hints of an even larger deal underscore the significant collaboration aimed at maximizing manufacturing efficiency.
