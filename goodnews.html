          <p>China is spearheading a renewed initiative to create a development bank for the 10-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which also includes Russia and India. The primary goal of this financial institution is to insulate member countries from the economic risks associated with the US dollar-dominated global trade system. Analysts believe the bank would also serve to accelerate key infrastructure projects and deepen economic integration within the Eurasian bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Met Office has reported a strong possibility that the aurora borealis will be visible across large portions of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare opportunity for southern sightings is attributed to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun. While visibility will ultimately depend on local weather conditions like cloud cover and light pollution, the event could provide a memorable celestial display for many.</p>
