          <p>Grant Hardin, known as the ‚ÄúDevil in the Ozarks,‚Äù was apprehended on Friday near the prison from which he escaped nearly two weeks prior. Hardin, who was serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, had impersonated a corrections officer to facilitate his escape. Law enforcement officials, including tracking dogs and a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit, located Hardin approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. Hardin's capture brings an end to a widespread manhunt and assuages fears of potential harm to the community.</p>

          <p>Achieving longevity requires more than just individual optimization through diet and exercise; it necessitates a collective responsibility towards public health. The author, a public health scientist, argues that societal factors, such as public policy, infrastructure, and community, play a crucial role in determining health outcomes. Countries with longer, healthier lives often have governments and cultures that normalize healthy living through policies like nutritious food programs and clean air initiatives. The focus should shift from individual self-help to supporting policies that create healthier environments for everyone.</p>
