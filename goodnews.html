        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "energy vampires" refers to individuals in friendships who consistently drain one's emotional and mental vitality, often characterized by incessant complaining, self-centeredness, or a noticeable lack of genuine interest in their friends' lives. Experts, including psychologist Suzy Reading and journalist Radhika Sanghani, identify common red flags such as an overwhelming need for attention and reassurance, or subtle emotional erosion through backhanded compliments. A crucial tell-tale sign is the feeling of exhaustion after spending time with them. Strategies for managing these dynamics include open and honest communication about feeling unheard, establishing firm boundaries on interaction frequency or topics, and modifying shared activities to prevent one person from dominating the conversation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations to become a hub for green marine fuels hinge significantly on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already made progress with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel operations, green methanol requires a robust infrastructure for mainland-produced fuel to be imported, stored, and sold tax-free. Wang highlighted this at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large-vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. Despite green methanol costing four times more, its usage is expected to increase from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is on track for a significant victory and a new parliamentary majority in elections deemed critical for the nation's European Union aspirations. With 96% of votes tallied, PAS garnered close to 50%, far surpassing the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc. President Sandu had previously cautioned about "massive Russian interference," a concern amplified by bomb scares at international polling stations and arrests related to planned post-election unrest. Despite opposition leader Igor Dodon's premature claims of victory and calls for protests, the outcome solidifies Sandu's pro-Western mandate, guiding Moldova further towards the EU amidst ongoing regional geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has strongly condemned the "unacceptable" and abusive behavior directed at European players and their families during the Ryder Cup in New York, disclosing that his wife, Erica, was struck by a thrown beer. McIlroy asserted that golf, as a sport, demands a higher standard of conduct, urging spectators to focus on supporting their own team rather than resorting to personal attacks. He reflected on the emotional and mental toll of the week, but ultimately expressed pride in how the European team's performance served to silence the hostile crowd. Fellow player Shane Lowry further corroborated the severity of the abuse, particularly towards Erica McIlroy, underscoring the challenging atmosphere the European team overcame to secure their 15-13 victory.</p>

This pivotal play, combined with Stafford's other touchdown passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, and two key interceptions by Kam Curl, propelled the Rams to an impressive 3-1 record. Coach Sean McVay lauded Atwell's mental toughness and resilience, emphasizing his readiness to perform when called upon, underscoring the team's promising early-season form.</p>

          <p>The historic Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, celebrated for its iconic windmills, is set to implement a €17.50 entry fee for all non-local tourists beginning next spring. This initiative is a direct response to the escalating issue of over-tourism, with visitor numbers reaching 2.6 million last year for a residential population of just 100. Marieke Verweij, the museum director, emphasized the severe lack of privacy experienced by residents, citing instances of tourists entering private gardens and homes. The proposed fee, which will include admission to the museum and the interior of the windmills, is projected to generate substantial annual revenue, earmarked for essential maintenance and new infrastructure. While some visitors and locals support the move to preserve the village's unique charm, local businesses express concerns about potential revenue loss.</p>

Those who decline the offer without reasonable excuse could face benefit sanctions.

Reeves will also advocate for a society where "hard work is matched by fair reward." The scheme builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will involve private companies covering some wages, funded from existing budgets, addressing the nearly one million 16-24-year-olds not in education, employment, or training.</p>

          <p>Renowned Chinese writer Yan Lianke, now 67, shares his perspective on consistently being considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature, asserting that the prospect no longer influences his writing or causes pressure. He acknowledges the inherent and natural debates that often accompany past laureates, highlighting that literature's profound magic and greatness stem from its capacity for diverse interpretations, where different readers can find varied meanings. Yan Lianke firmly believes in the simplest principle of literary common sense: that any human experience is a legitimate subject for literature, and no single experience is inherently more noble or deserving of literary exploration than another. His insights underscore the subjective nature of literary appreciation and the vast breadth of human stories that quality literature can embrace.</p>
