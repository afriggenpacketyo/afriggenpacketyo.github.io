          <p>Smartex, a tech company co-founded by Gilberto Loureiro, is revolutionizing the textile industry by using cameras, vision software, and AI to detect defects in fabrics during production, thus reducing waste. The company claims to have prevented one million kilograms of fabric waste in the past three years. The fashion industry has a significant waste problem, with a truckload of clothes being discarded every second. Smartex has attracted investments from H&M Group and Tony Fadell, and is also supported by Amazon's AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose numbers have declined by 90% in the past 30 years. Nature Conservation Cymru is feeding the voles glitter-covered apples, with the goal of tracking their movements through their droppings. Different colors of glitter will help distinguish between families and their territories. This tracking will inform environmental adjustments like removing invasive conifers and fencing off riverbanks to protect the voles' habitat.</p>

          <p>Apple plans to significantly increase iPhone production in India, aiming for a majority of iPhones sold in the US to originate there. This move is intended to mitigate the impact of tariffs and diversify Apple's supply chain away from China. While India presents a major opportunity, challenges include cost competitiveness, labor market rigidities, and supply chain vulnerabilities. India must invest heavily in infrastructure, skills, and technology to transition into a truly independent manufacturing hub for Apple.</p>
