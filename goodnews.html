          <p>The consumer price index rose 0.3% in September, bringing the annual inflation rate to 3.0%, a figure slightly below economists' expectations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report, the only economic data released during the government shutdown, showed that core inflation, excluding food and energy, also came in lower than predicted. This muted inflation data has strengthened market expectations that the Federal Reserve will proceed with another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting to support a softening labor market.

          <p>Activist investor Jana Partners has taken a roughly 9% stake in Six Flags Entertainment, teaming up with NFL star Travis Kelce and seasoned executives to push for changes at the amusement park operator. The group plans to address the company's operational issues, poor technological integration, and the need for a new CEO following its troubled merger with Cedar Fair. Kelce's involvement is seen as a unique asset to revitalize the brand's marketing, while Jana urges the board to consider all options, including a potential sale of the company.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru secured a significant victory in a by-election for the Caerphilly constituency, defeating the populist Reform UK and the incumbent Labour Party. The result is a major blow to Labour, which had held the seat since 1999, and a setback for Reform UK's ambitions to gain a foothold in the Welsh parliament. Plaid Cymru framed the win as a choice for a "positive, pro-Wales vision" over division, positioning itself as the primary alternative to both Labour and the right-wing populism of Reform.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average retirement benefit by about $56 per month starting in January. This annual adjustment is intended to help the benefits for nearly 75 million recipients keep pace with inflation, though it may not fully offset rising costs for those who rely heavily on this income. The increase is based on the Consumer Price Index and is in line with expert projections, following a 2.5% COLA in 2025.</p>

          <p>A decaying lakeside villa once owned by Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels will be repurposed for guided tours and events, saving it from demolition. The state of Berlin, which had struggled with the property's high upkeep costs, has temporarily transferred the site to the local municipality of Wandlitz. The villa, a gift to Goebbels in 1936, was used as a retreat and later by the East German communist party's youth wing. This move addresses the long-standing dilemma of how to manage former Nazi sites without erasing history or allowing them to become extremist shrines.</p>

          <p>Shares for both Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and IBM saw a significant jump of over 6% following a report that IBM can use AMD's chips for certain quantum computing algorithms. A forthcoming paper is expected to show that an error-correction algorithm, crucial for the stability of quantum systems, can run on AMD's field-programmable gate array chips. This development highlights the ongoing collaboration between the two tech giants and has sparked renewed investor interest in the broader quantum computing sector, which aims to solve problems beyond the reach of classical computers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Comparing National Sexual Assault Statistics Across Europe is Misleading</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media chart claiming the UK has the highest rate of sexual assault in Europe is highly misleading, according to a fact-check analysis. The data is not comparable across countries due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and how crimes are counted. For instance, the UK's broader, consent-based laws and its practice of recording each transgression in a group assault as a separate offense inflates its numbers relative to other nations. Criminologists suggest that victim surveys provide a more accurate measure of prevalence than police-reported crime statistics.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called off a planned immigration enforcement "surge" in San Francisco after a direct appeal from the city's new mayor, Daniel Lurie. Trump stated he was giving the mayor a chance to "turn it around," also citing calls from supportive tech leaders in the area. The decision marks a surprising de-escalation, as federal agents had already begun mobilizing at a nearby Coast Guard base, and protests were underway. Mayor Lurie, a centrist Democrat, has adopted a pragmatic, non-confrontational approach toward the administration, focusing on local safety and progress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an introduction to a new edition of Mary Shelley's novel, filmmaker Guillermo del Toro reflects on Frankenstein as a profound spiritual parable about abandonment and the absence of paradise. He argues that horror, like fairy tales, provides a crucial space to explore internal conflicts and existential questions safely. Del Toro sees the story's power in its tragedy, which requires no villain, only an uncaring creator and a creature burdened with a lonely existence. He connects its themes to his own work, viewing both Frankenstein and Pinocchio as essential stories of fathers, sons, and the search for truth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on the remains of Napoleon's soldiers from a mass grave in Lithuania has revealed they suffered from more diseases than previously known during their disastrous 1812 retreat from Russia. In addition to typhus and trench fever, modern DNA analysis of the soldiers' teeth found evidence of bacteria causing paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. These findings from paleogenomic scientists illustrate the complex microbial assault the Grande Armée faced, where multiple fever-inducing illnesses, combined with starvation and freezing conditions, contributed to the army's near-total annihilation.</p>
