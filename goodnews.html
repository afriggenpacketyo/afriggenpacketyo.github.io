          <p>Republicans in the House Ways and Means Committee have moved forward with a bill that would eliminate federal income tax on tips, fulfilling a campaign promise by President Trump. The proposed law would create an above-the-line deduction for tips received by workers in traditionally tipped occupations, with the deduction phasing out for individuals making over $160,000 a year. The provision is set to expire after 2028, and it's unclear if the final version will include a maximum deduction, though previous legislation proposed a $25,000 cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the current interest rate environment, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is significantly cheaper than a personal loan.

HELOCs are secured by the borrower's home, contributing to the lower rate, and variable rates are expected to decline further. Borrowers can save hundreds of dollars per month by choosing a HELOC over a personal loan, but should carefully calculate repayments to ensure long-term affordability. (not investment advice)</p>
