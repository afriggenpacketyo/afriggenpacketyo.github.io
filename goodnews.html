          <p>Brexit is back in the spotlight as the UK and EU explore revisions to their existing trade agreement, driven by the geopolitical shifts since the original deal. Both sides acknowledge the need for closer defense and security ties, particularly in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and concerns over US commitment to European security. Negotiations are focusing on narrowly defined changes, with the UK committed to staying out of the EU's customs union, single market, and free movement of people. Discussions include easing trade barriers, veterinary agreements, artist touring arrangements, and security pacts, with both sides aiming to highlight improved defense cooperation and streamlined travel for UK citizens in the EU. The optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ann Burgess, a psychiatric nursing professor from Massachusetts, is the subject of a new documentary detailing her groundbreaking work with the FBI in profiling serial killers. Starting in the 1960s, Burgess interviewed sexual assault victims, identifying behavioral patterns that helped the FBI understand how killers think, a shift from the traditional "just the facts" approach. Her work led to involvement in high-profile cases, and she faced sexism while changing the way law enforcement thought about sexual assault and murder. Now, Burgess works with her granddaughter, profiling school shooters and training nurses to recognize signs of sexual assault in dementia care facilities, continuing her legacy of crime analysis and prevention.</p>

          <p>A senior Asian economist suggests that China's yuan could potentially rival the US dollar as a global currency if Beijing liberalizes convertibility and access for foreign investors. The economist, Hoe Ee Khor, notes that the US dollar is losing its status as the sole safe currency and that the yuan is increasingly used in cross-border purchase settlements. To further challenge the dollar, China needs to deepen its financial markets to allow easier foreign access to yuan-denominated assets and develop new yuan-backed asset classes.</p>

The election, which followed months of political turbulence, saw a large voter turnout, with Dan securing 55% of the vote. While Simion initially claimed victory, Dan's win is seen as a repudiation of Simion's more skeptical approach to the EU and reaffirms Romania's pro-Western ties. Dan campaigned on fighting corruption and supporting Ukraine, while Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv.</p>
