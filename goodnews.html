          <h2>RFK Jr. to Request New Measles Treatment Guidelines from CDC</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 18:15:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now serving as Health and Human Services Secretary, plans to ask the CDC to develop new guidelines for measles treatment, including the use of drugs and vitamins. This decision comes amid criticism of Kennedy's misleading remarks about measles vaccines and infection curability, despite vaccination being the only proven preventive measure. The CDC's effort would involve universities to develop protocols and testing for new uses of existing therapeutics, although vaccination remains the primary recommendation. The agency also cautioned against overuse of vitamin A, as promoted by Kennedy, due to potential toxicity, and that vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported strong first-quarter results but issued lighter-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, citing uncertainty related to President Trump's tariffs and trade policies. The company anticipates operating income between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, falling short of consensus forecasts, with sales projected to grow between 7% and 11%. Tariffs, particularly on goods sourced from China, pose a significant challenge to Amazon's retail unit and third-party sellers, potentially leading to increased prices and reduced advertising spend. Despite the challenges, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy expressed optimism that the company could emerge stronger from the tariff environment.</p>

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has requested immediate action from the Commerce Secretary, Treasury Secretary, and U.S. Trade Representative, including automatic exclusions for small importers and products not readily available in the U.S. The chamber also seeks a process for companies to apply for relief if tariffs significantly threaten employment. While the imposition of tariffs has been paused for some countries, the uncertainty continues to affect businesses.</p>

          <p>Kya Christian Nelson, a Wisconsin man, received a 44-month federal prison sentence for orchestrating a series of "swatting calls" by hacking into Ring doorbell cameras. Nelson and his accomplices targeted homes across multiple states, making false emergency calls to trigger SWAT team responses and livestreaming the events on social media. The victims, who were strangers to Nelson, experienced significant distress and disruption as a result of the scheme. One of Nelson's co-conspirators also received a lengthy prison sentence for his involvement in the crime.</p>

The company's CEO, Chris Kempczinski, noted that heightened anxiety about the economy is affecting lower-income Americans, leading to reduced traffic in U.S. restaurants. President Trump's tariff agenda has created widespread uncertainty among businesses and consumers, causing companies to pull back on growth plans and consumers to delay purchases.

Democrats cited concerns that enhanced punishments could disproportionately affect children in LGBT or interracial relationships, although the prevalence of such cases is unclear.
