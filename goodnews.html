          <p>Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration after the Department of Homeland Security announced it would block international students from attending the university. The lawsuit accused the administration of retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights. The university argued that stopping the flow of international students would destabilize Harvard's existence, as they contribute significantly to the university and its mission. A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from implementing the order, stating that it would cause "immediate and irreparable injury" to the university.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors. The orders mandate the NRC to decide on reactor licenses within 18 months and establish a regulatory framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct reactors on federal land. This initiative is intended to power critical defense facilities and AI data centers, with the departments using their own authorities for reactor construction. The move also focuses on jump-starting uranium mining in the U.S. and expanding domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>
