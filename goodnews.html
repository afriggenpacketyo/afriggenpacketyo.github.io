          <p>Kris Jenner surprised fans by debuting a new platinum blonde bob, a significant departure from her trademark black pixie cut. The 69-year-old matriarch of the Kardashian family showcased the look at a beauty line launch event, sparking a wave of online reactions from fans who noted her resemblance to her daughters, Kim and Khloé. Celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton shared a behind-the-scenes video of the transformation process.

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. announced fiscal third-quarter profits that exceeded Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to strategic price increases and a greater focus on direct-to-consumer sales. The denim company's gross margin improved to 61.7%, and it has successfully raised prices on some items without negatively impacting demand. As a result of the strong performance, Levi's has raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 3% and adjusted its earnings per share guidance upward. Despite the positive report, the company's stock saw a decline in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American rare earth and critical mineral mining companies experienced a significant surge after China implemented stricter export controls on these materials. The new Chinese regulations require licenses for exporting products containing rare earths or utilizing Chinese extraction technology, a move seen as an effort to control global tech supply chains. This has fueled speculation that the U.S. government will increase investment in domestic supply chains to reduce dependency on China. The development underscores the ongoing trade tensions and the strategic importance of these materials for defense, technology, and manufacturing sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature for his challenging and profound work. Known for his long, complex sentences and themes of political oppression and existential dread, Krasznahorkai's writing defies easy categorization but offers a powerful critique of societal decay. His novels, such as "The Melancholy of Resistance," often create a timeless and placeless atmosphere, allowing his explorations of chaos and resignation to resonate universally. The Nobel committee's choice highlights a writer whose distinct style captures the anxieties of life under oppressive regimes while invigorating readers through its sheer propulsive force.</p>

          <h2>Director Benny Safdie Discusses His New Film 'The Smashing Machine' Starring Dwayne Johnson</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his first solo directing project, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the career and personal struggles of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film focuses on the psychological toll of a champion's decline, delving into Kerr's battle with painkiller addiction and his tumultuous relationship. Safdie aimed to portray the gritty, semi-lawless early days of the sport rather than creating a traditional, triumphant sports biopic. The role offers Johnson a chance to tackle a more vulnerable and complex character, moving beyond his established persona as a larger-than-life action hero.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems, a company at the center of 2020 election conspiracy theories, has been acquired by Liberty Vote, a new entity founded by former Republican Missouri election official Scott Leiendecker. Leiendecker, who also founded the electronic pollbook company KnowInk, stated the acquisition marks a "new chapter for American elections" focused on rebuilding trust. The new company plans to prioritize paper-based transparency and maintain 100% American ownership. The sale follows Dominion's multi-year legal battles to defend its reputation, which included a landmark $787.5 million settlement with Fox News over false election claims.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film adaptation of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," directed by Bill Condon, is a dazzling musical that powerfully contrasts the grim reality of a 1980s Argentine prison with vibrant, Technicolor fantasy sequences. The story follows two cellmates, a political prisoner (Diego Luna) and a gay window dresser (Tonatiuh), who escape their grim circumstances by recounting the plot of a fictional movie starring Ingrid Luna (Jennifer Lopez). The review praises the breakout performance of Tonatiuh and highlights Jennifer Lopez's commanding presence in her musical numbers. The film effectively uses its song-and-dance scenes to explore themes of humanity, joy, and emotional liberation amid oppression.</p>

          <h2>An Essay on the Transformative Experience of Inhabiting a Second Language</h2>

          <p>This personal essay reflects on the complex and transformative journey of learning English as a second language. The author recounts moving from Spain to the United States, where the pop-culture-infused English he learned was initially a poor fit for American suburban life, leading to feelings of alienation. Over time, however, fully embracing the new language for writing, thinking, and forming relationships allowed for the development of a new identity. The piece contemplates the benefits and challenges of multilingualism, celebrating the unique odyssey of self-discovery that comes from mastering a language far from one's mother tongue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to again discuss his potential nomination to lead NASA, according to a source familiar with the talks. Trump had previously nominated Isaacman for the position but withdrew the nomination after a public spat with Elon Musk, a close associate of Isaacman. At the time, Trump cited Isaacman's friendship with the SpaceX CEO as inappropriate for the head of the space agency. The new meeting suggests a potential reconciliation and that Isaacman, a seasoned space traveler, is once again being considered for the top job at NASA.</p>

          <h2>Student Loan Forgiveness Notices Sent by Education Department Amid Government Shutdown</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 14:56:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has begun sending notices to some student loan borrowers, informing them that their debt is eligible for cancellation under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. This action is proceeding despite the ongoing government shutdown. The IBR plan provides for debt forgiveness after 20 to 25 years of payments, and the department had previously paused these discharges to address court orders. The resumption of forgiveness is a significant development for long-term borrowers, especially since a provision making such forgiveness tax-free at the federal level is set to expire at the end of 2025.</p>
