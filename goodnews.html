          <h2>Meta Considered Acquiring Perplexity AI Before Investing in Scale AI</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta reportedly approached artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI with a potential takeover offer before deciding to invest $14.3 billion into Scale AI. While the two companies engaged in talks, they did not finalize a deal, with sources suggesting the discussions were either "mutually dissolved" or Perplexity chose to walk away. This attempt highlights Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg's aggressive efforts to strengthen the company's AI capabilities amid growing competition from OpenAI and Google's Alphabet. Zuckerberg is reportedly keen on hiring top AI talent and advancing Meta's position in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing applications. The failure to acquire Perplexity AI suggests Meta may need to explore alternative strategies to achieve its AI ambitions.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen plans to launch the autonomous ID. Buzz AD in 2026, aiming to surpass Tesla in the robotaxi market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The interest-earning potential of CDs and money market accounts is similar, but not identical, particularly in the current environment of cooling rates. CD rates vary based on the lender and term length, while money market accounts have variable interest rates. Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs, while declining slightly for longer terms. Savers should weigh the guaranteed interest of a CD against the potential for slightly higher earnings with a money market account, considering the volatility of the latter.
