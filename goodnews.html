          <p>This article provides an overview of the US National Guard, detailing its structure as part of the US Armed Forces Reserve, with both Army and Air National Guard branches. It outlines the National Guard's diverse roles, including disaster relief, internal security, and support for military operations abroad, with examples like the California wildfires and the Capitol riot. The command structure is explained, noting that governors typically control deployments within states, while the US president commands nationwide deployments. The article also highlights Trump's decision to override California's governor in deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles amid immigration protests. It also details the eligibility requirements and benefits of joining the National Guard.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed four core principles as a constructive framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing external interference. China asserts its commitment to managing tensions and differences, while the report blames regional tensions on external actors fueling rival claimants. The proposal comes amid increasing face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed waters, particularly near Scarborough Shoal and Second Thomas Shoal.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses how the threat of "peaceful evolution" ‚Äì a strategy to subvert the Communist Party through Western values ‚Äì has receded in China due to Trump's policies. The author, born in China in the 1960s, recalls being taught to be vigilant against American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing others on governance, while China has emerged as a major economic and global power. This shift has diminished the perceived threat of American subversion, according to the article.</p>

          <p>This poem explores the speaker's rejection of grand desires, such as space travel or deep-sea exploration, in favor of appreciating the small details of life. The speaker contrasts their perspective with someone constantly striving for more, choosing instead to slow down and find joy in simple things like the color of leaves, the smell of wood, and the wisdom gained through perseverance. The poem concludes with a sense of wonder at how life contains both exploding chaos and the birth of new beginnings.</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus for the final 140 miles after their Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to Rome.

Passengers endured a roughly 3-hour bus journey from Rome to Naples, causing disruption to their travel plans. American Airlines has apologized for the inconvenience caused by the unexpected change in transportation.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to revive manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes. The average age of aircraft mechanics is high, and the industry faces a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are working to attract younger people, but the pandemic-induced layoffs exacerbated the existing retirement wave. High-value sectors like aviation tend to pay well and remain in the US, but hiring remains difficult, compounded by a shortage of air traffic controllers. The Trump administration aims to increase wages and hiring to address these shortfalls.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America has transformed access to safe, self-managed abortions through the use of misoprostol. Beginning in the 1990s, activists shared information about the drug, which can induce abortions, and created hotlines and support networks to help women use it safely. They also gathered data to prove its effectiveness and safety, and advocated for its legalization. Today, the Socorristas en Red, the biggest abortion accompaniment network in the world, continues to provide support to women, even in countries where abortion is legal.</p>
