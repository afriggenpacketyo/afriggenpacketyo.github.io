          <p>Novelist Robert Harris, author of 'Conclave,' suggests the process of selecting a new Pope mirrors the dynamics of the TV show 'The Traitors,' where contestants identify 'traitors' among them. Harris notes the surprising and unpredictable nature of both conclaves and the show. He also reflects on the exclusion of women from the Catholic priesthood and papal elections, questioning its relevance in modern times. Harris shares his experience of researching his novel, including a Vatican visit facilitated by Pope Francis's office, which allowed him access to restricted areas.</p>
