          <p>South African Police Minister Senzo Mchunu stated that crime statistics disprove allegations of a 'white genocide,' noting that between January and March, five of six farm murder victims were black. This is the first time South Africa's crime statistics have been broken down by race, which Mchunu did in response to these claims. Trump had previously amplified claims of genocide, which led to attempts to reset relations after Trump granted asylum to Afrikaners. Mchunu also rejected Trump's allegations about government land expropriation, emphasizing that crime impacts all societal sections. The BBC found that Trump's evidence contained numerous falsehoods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House Republican tax and policy bill would repeal subsidies critical to electric vehicle (EV) growth, potentially slowing sales and production in the United States. The measure would eliminate subsidies for battery manufacturing, EV purchases, and charging stations, while imposing a new annual fee on EV owners. Analysts suggest that if the bill passes, EV prices would rise, and some automakers might delay factory plans, leaving the U.S. behind China and Europe in EV adoption. While analysts still expect EV sales to grow due to improving battery technology, the bill could significantly handicap the United States' ability to compete in the EV market. </p>

          <p>Nashville, Tennessee, has transitioned from its 'Music City' image to a thriving business hub, driven by rapid population growth and job opportunities in healthcare and technology. Tech giants like Amazon and Oracle have invested heavily, with Oracle developing a $1.4 billion Nashville campus for its global headquarters. The city's 10-year strategy has created over 600,000 jobs since 1990, significantly increasing per-capita income. Commercial and residential real estate have boomed, though affordable housing remains a challenge.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant job cuts and restructuring major federal agencies as part of its DOGE initiative. Judge Susan Illston issued a preliminary injunction, pausing further reductions in force and reorganization, asserting that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates. The Trump administration appealed the decision, arguing that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress is responsible for creating and funding federal agencies. The judge emphasized that large-scale executive branch reorganization requires partnership with Congress.</p>

          <p>Faced with President Trump's demand for NATO allies to spend 5% of their national income on defense, European countries are exploring creative accounting methods. Some NATO nations have backed a plan to target 3.5% of GDP for traditional military spending, plus 1.5% for non-traditional 'defense-related' spending by 2032. This could include infrastructure improvements like rail lines and cybersecurity enhancements. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized the need for enablers related to defense spending, reflecting efforts to appease Trump and address shortcomings in logistical preparedness highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The new approach acknowledges that the current 2% GDP pledge is insufficient.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all titles to the shelves after a new review using Pentagon-standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broad range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. The new review, using the Pentagon's search terms, identified only about 20 books for potential removal, pending further review by a Department of Defense panel. The move aligns with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

The New Jersey State Police confirmed the identification after collecting a family reference sample from one of Goodsell's great-grandchildren.

          <p>Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) may be attractive this summer due to declining interest rates, offering flexibility compared to home equity loans. Experts advise using HELOCs to capitalize on falling rates and consolidate credit card debt, potentially saving on interest. HELOCs can also fund home repairs and renovations, increasing property value. However, avoid using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as they carry the risk of foreclosure.
