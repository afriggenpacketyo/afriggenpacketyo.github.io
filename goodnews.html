          <p>Bill Gates has warned that 2025 could see the first increase in global child deaths in decades, potentially reversing 25 years of progress that cut annual deaths from over 10 million to under 5 million. To combat this, he announced a $912 million pledge to fight infectious diseases, stressing the need for sustained U.S. foreign health aid, which constitutes about 1% of the federal budget. Gates argued that continued investment is crucial for leveraging innovations like AI-driven tools and preventing future pandemics, emphasizing both the moral and strategic benefits of maintaining this modest funding level.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth rate for single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially indicating that landlords are adjusting to consumer financial pressures. According to data from Cotality, rent prices increased by 2.3% year-over-year, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a significant deceleration from the pandemic-era boom. While markets like Chicago still show strong growth, others, such as Miami, have cooled dramatically from their 2022 peaks. This trend is observed across all price tiers and could influence the strategies of single-family rental REITs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health organizations worldwide, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization, are pushing back against the Trump administration's claims linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) to autism. These agencies reaffirmed that the painkiller is considered safe for use during pregnancy and that there is no robust scientific evidence of a causal link to neurodevelopmental disorders. International experts cited large-scale studies, such as one following 2.5 million children in Sweden, that contradict the administration's assertions. The global consensus reinforces the position of U.S. medical groups, which have also disputed the claims made by President Trump.</p>

          <p>Actor Scarlett Johansson is stepping into the director's chair for the first time with her new film, "Eleanor the Great," starring 95-year-old June Squibb. The movie follows Eleanor Morgenstein, a woman who moves to New York City at age 94 after her best friend's death and finds herself entangled in a lie within a Holocaust survivors support group. Johansson stated that directing has been a dream since she was 12 and that the project came at the right time in her career. Squibb praised Johansson's leadership and actor-centric approach to directing, making for a positive and easy experience on set.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian analyzes the political landscape for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, suggesting she may be positioning herself for a future presidential or Senate run in 2028. The piece notes the growing frustration with the Democratic party's older leadership and a recent poll showing voter preference for progressive figures like AOC. It also discusses her perceived shift from an unapologetically left-wing figure to a more mainstream Democrat, which has drawn criticism from some former supporters. The author argues that despite any flaws, AOC possesses the necessary "fight" to challenge Trumpism and should not be underestimated.</p>

          <p>An NPR story from the "My Unsung Hero" series recounts how two strangers helped a woman named Lara Friedman and her 120-pound Rottweiler, The Dude. When nearby fireworks caused the dog to panic during a late-night walk, Friedman was unable to control him on the slippery sidewalks and feared for their safety. Two men, Blake and Bubba, first tried to help walk the dog home before offering to drive them, ensuring both Friedman and her terrified pet returned safely. Friedman expressed immense gratitude for their unexpected kindness, calling them "two angels" who came to their rescue in a moment of crisis.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is more than just a stock market barometer; it's a multi-billion dollar business for its parent company, S&P Global. The company generates massive revenue by licensing the S&P 500 name and data to financial products like index funds and ETFs, which now hold over $13 trillion in assets. The article explains that the index's dominance is protected by a "moat" of brand trust, economies of scale, and its status as a common language in finance, making it difficult for competitors to emerge. Despite its success, the index faces criticism for its increasing concentration in a few large tech stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut has lowered the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate to 6.13%, its most affordable level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of about $2,128, which is approximately $210 less per month compared to the 7%-plus rates seen at the beginning of the year. This reduction in borrowing costs provides significant relief to homebuyers and creates attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners. Over the life of the loan, the lower rate could save a borrower more than $75,000 in total interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

This will be the first crewed lunar mission since the Apollo 17 flight in 1972 and serves as a critical test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The crew will not land but will travel further into space than any previous mission, gathering data on the spacecraft's systems and the effects of deep space on the human body.

          <p>It has been almost three decades since a German footballer, Matthias Sammer in 1996, won the Ballon d'Or, the sport's top individual award. An article from DW explores potential reasons for this drought, despite Germany's national team and club successes, including a 2014 World Cup win. One theory is a lack of elite, flashy attacking players, as the award has overwhelmingly favored forwards. The nearly two-decade dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo also presented a major hurdle for all other contenders. However, with a new era emerging, young German talents like Jamal Musiala could have a chance to end the long wait.</p>
