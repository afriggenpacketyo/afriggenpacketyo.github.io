          <p>President Trump celebrated the passage of a major legislative package, dubbed the "megabill," during a rally in Iowa, promoting its tax cuts as the largest in U.S. history. He also detailed plans for the "America 250" celebration, which includes a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a new National Garden of American Heroes. The president commented on recent military strikes against Iran, framing the past two weeks as highly successful for his administration. He asserted that the military action led to the "complete obliteration" of Iran's nuclear facilities and recounted a conversation where he claims Iranian officials respectfully informed him of their retaliatory strike.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new left-wing political party, following an announcement by ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana that she was leaving the party to co-lead the new venture with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's "principled decision" and stated his delight that she will help build a real alternative to the current political system. This move formalizes efforts by a small group of independent pro-Gaza MPs, coordinated by Corbyn, to establish a party that could contest in upcoming local elections. While some on the left of the Labour party have praised the move, none have yet committed to joining.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are currently tracking 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, which was recently spotted by a telescope in Chile. The comet is approximately 20 kilometers wide and is traveling at about 60 kilometers per second, but it poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach in October being over 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. While its exact origin is unknown, astronomers believe it came from the direction of the Milky Way's galactic center. The discovery highlights advancements in telescope technology, and scientists expect to detect more such objects with new systems like the Vera Rubin Observatory going online soon.</p>

          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over two decades of experience has outlined five types of food he never feeds his children due to their long-term health risks. These include microwave popcorn, due to chemicals in the lining and flavoring, and flavored yogurts, which are often high in added sugars. He also avoids processed meats like bacon and deli meats because of their high sodium and nitrate content, which are linked to heart disease. Additionally, sugary cereals and drinks are off the table for their negative metabolic effects, as are deep-fried foods, which contain harmful compounds from being cooked in reused industrial oils. He advocates for healthier, home-prepared alternatives.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Offer Guidance on Deciding Whether to Hire Professional Movers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise asking four key questions before deciding to pay for professional movers, a service that can be costly but may reduce stress. Homeowners should consider if they have valuable or hard-to-replace items that would benefit from professional handling and insurance. It is also important to calculate the value of the time saved by outsourcing the labor compared to the expense. Furthermore, the potential for reduced stress and maintaining peace of mind is a significant factor. Finally, one must ensure that the cost of hiring movers does not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to taking on high-interest debt.</p>

          <h2>New Books on Weightlifting and Fashion Champion a Philosophy of Female Functionality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new books, one on weightlifting and another on fashion designer Claire McCardell, are highlighted for promoting a philosophy that values women's bodies for their functionality rather than just their appearance. Casey Johnston's memoir, "A Physical Education," describes how strength training helped her reject diet culture and see her body as a working object to be built up, not whittled down. Similarly, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson's biography of McCardell shows how the designer prioritized comfort and practicality, creating clothes for "doers" with features like pockets and accessible zippers. Both works advocate for a shift in perspective, valuing what bodies can do over how they look, offering a refreshing alternative to restrictive beauty standards.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of eight unusually large, 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort near Hadrian's Wall. One of the leather shoes measures nearly 13 inches long, equivalent to a modern U.S. size 15, a size rarely found at other Roman sites. The discovery has puzzled researchers, who are now investigating which Roman regiments were stationed at the fort to understand why so many large-sized shoes were discarded there. The shoes, along with other organic artifacts like a boxwood comb, were well-preserved in the low-oxygen soil of a defensive ditch, which the Romans often used as a rubbish dump.</p>

          <p>The Summer Fancy Food Show in New York showcased several emerging trends in the food and beverage industry that are expected to gain popularity. Upgraded condiments were a major theme, with new takes on mustard and flavored olive oils. The "swicy" (sweet and spicy) flavor profile continues to evolve, appearing in products like hot honey ketchup. Another notable trend is the rise of chef-led brands bringing restaurant-quality sauces and foods to home kitchens. Additionally, beef tallow is gaining traction as a cooking fat, promoted as an alternative to seed oils, while plant-based products are being marketed more on taste rather than their vegan credentials.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos of China's advanced J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the aircraft will be publicly unveiled at a major military parade in Beijing on September 3rd. The event will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and China is expected to showcase new military hardware. The new images show a J-20A prototype with modified air intakes, which are optimized for the more powerful, domestically produced WS-15 engines. These design changes are believed to enhance the fighter's stealth capabilities and aerodynamic performance, representing a significant step forward in China's military aviation technology.</p>

          <h2>Essay Explores the Enduring Relevance of Virginia Woolf's 'A Room of One's Own'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay reflects on Virginia Woolf's 1928 work, "A Room of One's Own," arguing for its continued relevance in understanding the systemic barriers women face. The author recounts initially dismissing the book as a totem of exclusionary white feminism but later discovering its profound insights into the necessity of financial independence and personal space for creative and intellectual freedom. The article draws parallels between Woolf's arguments and contemporary issues, such as the gender pay gap and the dismissal of women's stories. While acknowledging the book's limitations, the author suggests Woolf's core message about the link between economic control and mental freedom resonates with the modern, intersectional feminist movement.</p>

          <h2>Historical Essay: How the Continental Army Forged an American National Identity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores how the Continental Army, under General George Washington, was instrumental in creating a unified American identity during the Revolutionary War. In 1775, the colonies lacked a shared culture, viewing each other as competitors rather than compatriots. The army brought together men from 13 different colonies, and their shared experiences of hardship and sacrifice on the battlefield blurred provincial loyalties and fostered new national bonds. The army also established unifying traditions, such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the King's and adopting a national flag. In the postwar years, veterans continued this nation-building project, advocating for a strong federal government to preserve the republic they fought to create.</p>
