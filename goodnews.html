          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, confirming he will have a successor. This decision ends years of speculation and directly challenges China, which has long asserted that it has the sole authority to approve the next religious leader. The 14th Dalai Lama stated that the process of identifying his reincarnation will be handled by the Gaden Phodrang Trust, a non-profit he established, and must follow traditional Buddhist practices. This announcement is politically significant for Tibetans who resist Chinese control and is expected to lead to a scenario with two rival Dalai Lamas: one recognized by his followers and another appointed by Beijing.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweler Laopu Gold surged by 15% after a lock-up period ended, allowing pre-listing investors to sell a 40% stake in the company. Instead of a sell-off, investors rushed to buy the stock, which has increased over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024. Analysts attribute the strong performance to the company's powerful branding, pricing power, and rapid sales growth, particularly in its online channels. The stock's continued rise suggests strong market confidence in its growth prospects, including its expansion into overseas markets, even as it trades at a high valuation compared to competitors like Chow Tai Fook.

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a crackdown on the widespread price wars affecting numerous industries by vowing to regulate "disorderly low-price competition." This marks a more direct characterization of the issue, which officials previously referred to with the vaguer term "involutionary competition." The move aims to protect innovation, improve product quality, and promote the phasing out of outdated production capacity. Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting, where companies suppress prices to gain market share, as a significant threat to the long-term health and upgrading of the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>In a surprising first day of NBA free agency, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and is now a free agent. The move comes as both teams navigate significant injuries, with Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton also expected to miss the upcoming season with a ruptured Achilles. Lillard, who is likely to miss most of the next season, will have his remaining $112.6 million salary paid out over five years.</p>

          <p>Ryland Headley, aged 92, has been sentenced to life in prison for the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in 1967, a case solved after nearly six decades. The breakthrough came when cold case detectives re-examined evidence and found a DNA match linking Headley to the crime. Headley, who had a previous conviction for sexual assault in the 1970s, will now be considered a suspect in several other unsolved homicide and sexual assault cases in Suffolk, where he lived. Police are asking for any new information, as this is believed to be the UK's longest-running cold case to be successfully prosecuted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to end the program for Haitians in September, well before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling provides immediate relief for hundreds of thousands of Haitians who rely on the status for legal residency and work authorization, citing the ongoing instability and danger in their home country. The White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>
