          <p>The British and Irish Lions delivered a commanding performance, defeating the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV with a decisive 48-0 score in Adelaide. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout player, achieving a hat-trick as the team scored a total of eight tries in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. The victory was somewhat marred by injuries, with Garry Ringrose sustaining a suspected head injury and Luke Cowan Dickie being stretchered off the field. The match showcased the strength of the Lions' Scottish contingent, who were responsible for the first six tries.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," reveals that the 'I Love Lucy' star sought help for his severe alcoholism in his final years, prompted by his son, Desi Jr. Grappling with grief and isolation, Arnaz entered a rehabilitation program in 1985, a decision his daughter Lucie Arnaz called the proudest moment of her life. The book explores how the pressures of his career and past trauma contributed to his addiction, which strained his famous marriage to Lucille Ball. Although he successfully achieved sobriety, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer shortly after and passed away in 1986.</p>

          <p>After 13-year-old Micah Clayborne experienced chest pains, he was diagnosed with Danon disease, an extremely rare genetic condition that had caused his heart function to drop to just 7%. His mother, who had previously undergone a heart transplant, was also found to have the disease. Following his own successful heart transplant, Micah and his mother recognized a lack of support for teenagers in similar situations. In response, they launched Transplant Teenz, a virtual non-profit community that connects and provides resources for young people nationwide who are awaiting organ transplants.</p>

          <p>One year after China's Chang'e-6 mission returned rock samples from the moon's far side, a scientific debate persists regarding the age of the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin. A study based on these samples proposed an age of 4.25 billion years, a figure derived from the first direct evidence collected from the basin. However, these findings have faced resistance, having been rejected twice for peer review by a journal panel. Planetary scientist Yang Wei, while not involved in the study, described the data as the most credible evidence available, despite the ongoing controversy in the scientific community.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Parents Should Encourage More Unstructured, 'Wild' Physical Play for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured physical activity, to their detriment. The author contends that fears of injury and social pressures for sedentary behavior are depriving kids of crucial developmental benefits, including better physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Citing movement experts, the piece suggests that such 'wild' play builds a robust 'movement vocabulary,' which can prevent injuries later in life. It advocates for parents to create more opportunities for free-form physical exploration, like wrestling or balancing games, to foster resilience and skill.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that beauty expenses represent a significant and often overlooked financial hurdle for women. She describes the recurring costs for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," an insidious force driven by an industry that profits from insecurities. Tassin asserts that while spending on appearance can feel rational due to "pretty privilege," it is ultimately an investment in a depreciating asset. She advocates for a "hot girl detox," urging women to evaluate their spending and redirect the saved money toward debt repayment, savings, or investments.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, was rescued after being lost for nearly two weeks in the remote outback of Western Australia. She survived by drinking water from puddles and taking shelter in a cave after her van became stuck in the bushland. Police said she had walked 24 kilometers in a disoriented state and was suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and extensive insect bites when found. Her rescue was described as "sheer luck," as she was spotted by a passing driver and subsequently airlifted to a hospital in Perth for treatment.</p>

          <p>A new survey reveals that while U.S. graduates believe finance offers the best career prospects, employment data suggests otherwise. According to the New York Fed, majors like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates than finance. Similarly, philosophy and theology majors have better employment rates than economics graduates, challenging traditional notions of which degrees lead to job security. This trend is partly fueled by the rise of AI, which has increased demand for creative thinking and soft skills, leading some major firms like BlackRock to actively hire more humanities graduates.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged plan to sell up to six million shares this year. The sale comes as Huang's personal net worth has skyrocketed to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett. This financial success mirrors that of his company, which recently became the first to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the explosive demand for its AI chips. Despite the sale, Huang continues to hold over 858 million shares of Nvidia both directly and indirectly.</p>

          <p>This commentary addresses the recent culture war backlash against the new "Superman" film, arguing that accusations of it being "superwoke" are overblown. The author points out that Superman, an alien from Krypton raised on Earth, has fundamentally always been an immigrant story, a concept rooted in the character's creation by children of Jewish immigrants. The piece suggests that the film's focus on kindness and the hero's choice to protect humanity, shaped by his all-American upbringing in Kansas, reinforces themes of assimilation and opportunity rather than radical politics. The controversy is framed as a misinterpretation of the character's core identity.</p>
