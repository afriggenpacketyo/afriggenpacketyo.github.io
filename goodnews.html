        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as essential for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move would align with President Trump's goal of increasing high-end technology production within the United States. The potential intervention has already caused a significant surge in Intel's stock price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The supermarket chain Iceland is introducing a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a £1 credit for reporting shoplifters. The company's executive chairman stated that shoplifting costs the business approximately £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in staff. The move comes as shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest levels since 2002. Iceland has clarified that customers should not confront suspected thieves but should instead alert a staff member to receive the reward.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly 60% of U.S. adults are prioritizing the repayment of credit card debt, which has collectively surpassed $1.21 trillion amidst interest rates averaging close to 22%. The financial burden is compounded for the 45% of adults who carry balances on multiple cards, making repayment more complex. The article outlines several strategies for tackling this debt, including debt forgiveness programs, debt management plans through credit counseling, and debt consolidation via loans or balance transfer cards.

          <p>This literary piece reflects on the work of Scottish author Muriel Spark, prompted by a recent review of a new biography. The author delves into Spark's most famous novella, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," exploring its themes of adolescent development, moral education, and the powerful influence of a magnetic teacher on young minds. The story is told through the eyes of the students, particularly Sandy, whose journey into adulthood and conversion to Catholicism is framed by her complex relationship with her former mentor. The article celebrates Spark's realistic portrayal of how formative figures can leave an indelible mark on a person's life.</p>

This venture is set to become the largest studio facility in the state, significantly boosting its growing entertainment industry. The project aligns with recent Texas legislation that increased film incentives to $1.5 billion over the next decade. The new studio will serve as a home base for Sheridan's productions, such as "Landman" and "Lioness," further solidifying his impact on the local economy.</p>

          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, centered in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The largest tremor registered a magnitude of 4.0, but most were significantly smaller. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such earthquake swarms are common in this area and are induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity causes contractions and stresses in the surrounding rock, leading to frequent minor seismic activity.</p>

This trend is also visible in the luxury sector, with Richemont, owner of Cartier, reporting a 17% jump in American sales. However, jewelry brands face challenges from potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising costs of materials like silver and gold. (not investment advice)</p>
