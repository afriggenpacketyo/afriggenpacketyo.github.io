          <p>General Motors announced strong third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street forecasts, prompting the company to raise its financial guidance for 2025. The automaker reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, citing a compelling vehicle portfolio and effective management of tariff impacts. Despite a significant drop in net income due to charges from its electric vehicle pullback, the updated outlook signals confidence in GM's performance for the remainder of the year. The positive results led to a notable increase in the company's stock price during pre-market trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is set to release its third-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts anticipating earnings of 78 cents per share on $12.39 billion in revenue. The beverage company has faced challenges with weaker demand in key markets like the U.S. and Latin America, though investor sentiment remains more bullish compared to its rival, PepsiCo. The report comes as Coke is reportedly considering the sale of its Costa Coffee chain, which has not met growth expectations since its acquisition. The company's performance will be closely watched to see if it can maintain its projected full-year growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of former tenants of Equity Residential, one of the largest corporate landlords in the U.S., is launching a novel debt strike to protest what they describe as predatory practices. Organized with the Debt Collective, the campaign aims to have tens of thousands of dollars in accumulated rental debt canceled, arguing that it creates insurmountable barriers to securing future housing. The strike utilizes a new online tool that helps tenants document landlord issues and generate formal dispute letters, a tactic inspired by successful student debt resistance campaigns. This movement highlights a growing crisis of rental debt that has persisted since the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Scientists report that the population of the endangered North Atlantic right whale has increased slightly to an estimated 384 individuals, marking the fourth year of slow but steady growth. This positive trend follows a significant 25% decline between 2010 and 2020, offering a glimmer of hope for one of the world's rarest marine mammals. Researchers attribute the recovery to conservation efforts, particularly new protective measures in Canada, and note encouraging signs in reproduction, such as new mothers and shorter calving intervals. However, threats from ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement remain a serious concern.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service forecasts a slight chance of light rain for parts of Southern California this week, particularly in interior valleys and mountain areas. Following last week's significant storm, the incoming system is expected to be much weaker but carries a small possibility of thunderstorms and dry lightning, especially near the Grapevine. While last week's rainfall temporarily reduced fire risk, meteorologists caution that this potential moisture does not change the long-term forecast for a dry winter due to the return of La Niña conditions, which typically bring drought to the region.</p>

          <h2>An Excerpt from Myriam Gurba's 'Poppy State' Explores Connections Between Botany, History, and Personal Memory</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This piece features an excerpt from Myriam Gurba's new book, "Poppy State." The writing weaves together personal memories, reflections on the California poppy, and a critical look at the history of botany in the American West. Gurba juxtaposes her childhood reverence for native wildflowers with the colonial attitudes of early botanists like Sara Allen Plummer Lemmon, who she notes described Indigenous people with derogatory terms. The excerpt blends intimate storytelling with historical critique, exploring the complex layers of meaning embedded in the natural landscape and the problematic legacies of those who documented it.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City after its windshield cracked mid-flight. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with the CEO of WindBorne Systems stating he believes one of his company's weather balloons struck the aircraft. The company has contacted the NTSB and FAA to assist in the investigation and has implemented software changes to minimize its balloons' time at active flight levels. The Boeing 737, carrying 134 passengers, landed safely, and another aircraft completed the journey to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has made history by being elected as Japan's first female prime minister after securing a majority in parliament. A staunch conservative and ally of the late Shinzo Abe, the 64-year-old takes office at a time of economic difficulty, facing rising living costs and public frustration with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Her path to leadership was secured through a last-minute coalition deal after the LDP's longtime partner withdrew support. Takaichi now faces the challenge of rebuilding public trust, navigating tricky foreign relations with China and South Korea, and preparing for an upcoming meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

The military government accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group, of involvement in the operation, a claim the group denies.

They pushed members of Congress for increased funding for cancer research, expanded access to screening, and the retention of health insurance subsidies.
