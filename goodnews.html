          <h2>Biblical Principles for Choosing a Spouse Highlighted as Lessons for Modern Dating</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 11:14:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in Fox News explores the biblical story of Abraham finding a wife for Isaac as a guide for modern dating. The article suggests that identifying essential traits, committing to marriage, and cultivating love through giving are key principles. It contrasts this with modern dating trends, which often involve prolonged compatibility testing and casual relationships. The article argues that the Bible offers a proven formula for marital happiness, emphasizing core values and commitment over superficial preferences, and that the Hebrew language itself supports this idea, connecting love with the act of giving.</p>

With teammate Wout van Aert's support, Yates extended his lead, finishing the stage with a significant advantage. Yates' victory marks him as the third British rider to win the Giro, joining Chris Froome and Tao Geoghegan Hart, and reflects years of dedication overcoming numerous setbacks.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed New Shepard flight. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and stunning views before returning to Earth. The flight reached an altitude of nearly 65 miles, crossing the boundary between the atmosphere and space. This mission continues Blue Origin's efforts in the sub-orbital passenger market, which it has dominated since Virgin Galactic paused flights in 2024, with an estimated cost of over $500,000 per seat.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults shares five simple parenting rules for raising highly successful kids. These rules emphasize trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, observing and supporting a child's individual interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than strict development, and being authentic. The psychiatrist argues that parenting does not have to be complicated and parents should rely on their inherent abilities, cultural wisdom, and the unique needs of their child. The advice aims to reduce parental anxiety and promote a more joyful and effective approach to raising children.</p>

          <p>Karla Flores, diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, underwent an MRI that revealed a second tumor on her spine. Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye, a first-of-its-kind procedure. The surgery involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor, which was then successfully removed. The innovative approach allowed Flores to avoid paralysis and is being considered for other difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>

Duckworth emphasizes that AI can be a coach, providing examples and explanations that enhance understanding. She highlights a study showing that students who used AI to practice writing cover letters produced stronger letters on their own.</p>
