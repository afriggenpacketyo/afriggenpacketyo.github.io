          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only by her surname Zhou, was dramatically rescued after enduring 30 hours trapped in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province. Finding herself without a phone and unable to open the malfunctioning door from the inside, Zhou resorted to a desperate measure. She bit her finger, used her own blood to write "110 625" (the emergency number and her room number) on a pillow, and then threw it from the sixth-floor window. A quick-thinking food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the message and immediately alerted police, leading to her successful liberation and earning him a public reward.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is projected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean and is expected to pose no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm, located east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, is moving northeast and is forecast to become a post-tropical cyclone by early Wednesday before dissipating. Fernand marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which also remained at sea after reaching Category 5 intensity. This favorable forecast brings relief amidst NOAA's prediction of an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Two construction workers in China's Shaanxi province experienced a harrowing ordeal when they became trapped mid-air on a suspended gondola during a sudden, intense rainstorm. The incident left them precariously suspended for approximately 20 minutes before emergency rescue teams successfully intervened and brought them to safety. This event underscores the inherent dangers and unpredictable challenges faced by individuals working in high-risk environments, particularly when confronted with rapidly changing and severe weather conditions. The swift and effective rescue operation, which saw no reported injuries, highlights the importance of rapid response protocols in such emergencies.</p>

          <p>Former England and Team GB rugby player Heather Fisher openly discusses her profound struggle with alopecia, which caused her hair loss before the 2010 Rugby World Cup. Fisher, a World Cup winner and Olympian, recounts years of feeling "disgusting" and facing discrimination, including being mistaken for a man and physically removed from women's toilets. She emphasizes the deep impact on her identity and the challenge of being authentic within the professional sports system. Fisher reflects on the evolving landscape of women's sports and the growing role of social media in promoting diversity, expressing regret that she couldn't share her story more openly during her playing career.</p>

          <h2>Congressional Budget Office Report Sparks Debate on Effectiveness of Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 05:00:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report has sparked significant debate by projecting that President Trump's tariffs, implemented between January and August 2025, will reduce primary deficits by $3.3 trillion over a decade, alongside $0.7 trillion in interest outlay reductions. This surprising finding challenges traditional free-trade arguments, as it suggests tariffs have generated substantial revenue without triggering widespread inflation or plummeting growth. While some free-market economists remain skeptical, viewing tariffs as taxes, the report prompts a reevaluation of Trump's trade policies. The constitutional limits of presidential tariff authority, currently under review by the Federal Circuit Court, also remain a critical legal question. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has successfully launched the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (Juno) in Guangdong province, establishing it as the world's largest detector for elusive "ghost particles" known as neutrinos. This massive facility, featuring a 20,000-ton liquid scintillator detector housed 700 meters underground, has officially begun collecting data. Its primary mission is to precisely measure the mass of different neutrino types produced by two nearby nuclear power plants. This international project, initially proposed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2008, marks a significant and historic milestone in particle physics research, aiming to unlock more secrets of these mysterious subatomic particles.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot expressed clear skepticism regarding Newcastle United's tactical approach during his team's dramatic 3-2 victory at St James' Park. Slot commented that he wasn't "too sure if I saw a football match," referencing the high number of set-pieces and long throws, and the ball being in play for only 40.8% of the game. The match saw Liverpool's 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha score a 100th-minute winner, after Newcastle, playing with 10 men, fought back from a two-goal deficit. This feisty encounter, marked by 32 fouls and a red card, added to the tension of a potential player transfer between the clubs, underscoring the intense rivalry.</p>

          <p>China plans to accelerate the expansion of its national carbon market, aiming to incorporate major industries by 2027, three years ahead of its original schedule. New guidelines also introduce absolute limits on emissions, a significantly stricter standard than the current carbon intensity caps. This strategic move underscores China's commitment to achieving its climate targets and is expected to invigorate the often-sluggish carbon market by spurring demand for carbon allowances. Currently covering only power generators, the market will add steel, aluminum, and cement industries this year, though with less stringent initial rules to facilitate their transition.
