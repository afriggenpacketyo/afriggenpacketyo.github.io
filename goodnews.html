          <p>Shares of Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy company, experienced a 17% increase during its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, following an initial public offering (IPO) that raised approximately $273 million. The company's successful IPO is closely watched as a potential indicator of investor interest in health-tech solutions after an extended period of dormancy in the tech IPO market since late 2021. Hinge Health, founded in 2014, uses software to assist patients in treating musculoskeletal injuries, chronic pain, and post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. The company's CEO highlighted its technology automating care delivery as a key factor attracting investor interest.</p>

          <p>The House passed President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" by a single vote after an all-night session, with Representative Andrew Garbarino missing the vote because he was asleep. Speaker Mike Johnson humorously mentioned Garbarino's absence, noting that the representative would have voted in favor of the bill. The bill includes a provision to raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000, a key issue for New York representatives like Garbarino. The measure now proceeds to the Senate, where its future is uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Three Myths About Investing in Gold as Prices Surge</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the price of gold reaches record highs, investors should be wary of common misconceptions. While gold's price generally rises over time, it experiences short-term dips. Inflation doesn't always guarantee a rise in gold prices, as recent increases occurred despite declining inflation rates. Waiting for a significant price drop to invest in gold may not be a worthwhile strategy, as gold prices tend to remain elevated. Investors should understand these myths to make informed decisions and avoid potential portfolio damage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned almost all of the 381 books initially removed from its libraries after a new review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. A defense official said that the new review found only about 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions.</p>

Trump aired a video of a radical opposition leader singing about "killing" white farmers and repeated claims of land expropriation. South Africans are angered by Trump's "genocide" claims, but also admire Ramaphosa's diplomatic approach.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has continued its rally, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption.

The Trump administration's pro-crypto agenda has also supported the market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a notable bitcoin skeptic, said that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.</p>
