          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to justify federalizing the Guard without the governor's consent. The decision emphasized the constitutional principles separating military and civil authority, a ruling celebrated by Oregon officials as a victory for state sovereignty and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza in the coming days after Hamas agreed to key parts of a peace plan proposed by President Trump. The plan involves a phased Israeli withdrawal and the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with an Egyptian-hosted delegation set to finalize details. While Hamas accepted some terms, including handing over Gaza's administration to a technocratic body, Netanyahu has signaled that a full Israeli withdrawal is not guaranteed.</p>

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has affected 13 members of her family, and she now faces the likelihood of developing the condition in her 40s. Despite the difficult diagnosis, she is using this knowledge to plan for a family through IVF and embryo screening, ensuring the gene is not passed on to her children.</p>

          <p>Waiting in long lines for store openings and product launches is evolving from an inconvenience into a social activity, particularly among younger consumers. People are drawn by a sense of camaraderie, the excitement of being first, and the opportunity to gain exclusive items or "goodie bags." Psychologists attribute the trend to the release of dopamine from the anticipation of a reward, a phenomenon that brands are leveraging through experiential marketing to create buzz and social media content.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed Reverend Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, succeeds the church's first female leader and will oversee the nation's largest Lutheran body, which has 2.7 million members. His installation is seen as a pivotal moment that could encourage more leaders of color within the church as it navigates challenges like declining membership and theological disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lithuania's main airport in Vilnius reopened its airspace after a temporary closure early Sunday morning. The shutdown was reportedly caused by the sighting of a series of balloons potentially flying towards the airport, which led to the diversion of several flights to nearby cities. The source of the balloons has not been identified, and the incident follows other recent European airport closures due to drone sightings, occurring amidst heightened security concerns in the region.</p>

          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common ailment among new university students, is not a single virus but an assortment of common colds that spread rapidly in a new environment. Immunologists explain that students from diverse locations bring different viruses, creating a "mixing pot" of infections in crowded lecture halls and social settings. The illness is often exacerbated by factors common in the first weeks of term, such as stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption, all of which weaken the immune system.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that would have transferred unaccompanied migrant children to adult ICE detention centers upon turning 18. Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that the initiative violates a 2021 court order requiring these individuals to be released to the "least restrictive setting available" unless they pose a flight or safety risk. The ruling comes amid criticism of other administration policies, including offering stipends for voluntary self-deportation, which advocates argue coerce children into abandoning their legal rights.</p>
