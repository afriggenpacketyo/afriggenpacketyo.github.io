        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, some homeowners are considering using a home equity loan to purchase a second property. This article explores the key factors to evaluate before making such a decision, including the broader interest rate climate and how much equity is available. It also emphasizes the importance of aligning this financial move with long-term goals, as leveraging a primary residence as collateral carries significant risks. While lower rates make borrowing cheaper, a careful calculation of costs and benefits is advised to avoid potential foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During his address at the United Nations, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva strongly criticized Washington's policies on tariffs and military actions while advocating for closer ties with China. Despite the sharp rebuke, U.S. President Donald Trump extended an unexpected diplomatic overture shortly after the speech. Trump told reporters that he and Lula had "excellent chemistry" during a brief encounter and announced they had agreed to meet the following week. This development comes amid heightened tensions, including significant U.S. tariffs on Brazilian imports, making the proposed meeting a surprising turn of events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>YouTube has announced a new policy that will allow creators whose channels were previously terminated to apply for reinstatement. This change reverses the platform's former stance of permanent bans for certain violations, specifically those related to COVID-19 and election misinformation. The Google-owned company stated the move is part of a limited pilot project and reflects that its community guidelines on these topics have evolved. The policy shift follows pressure from Republican lawmakers who have accused tech companies of censorship, though YouTube maintains it will not use third-party fact-checkers to moderate content.</p>

          <p>Half a century after her iconic song "Lovin' You" topped the charts, the music of Minnie Riperton is being celebrated with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl featuring artists like Stevie Wonder and George Benson. Riperton, known for her five-octave vocal range and famous "whistle register," died of breast cancer in 1979 at age 31, cutting short a promising career. Despite her premature death, her influence persists, with her work being sampled by hip-hop artists and admired by a new generation of R&B singers. The tribute aims to reintroduce her artistry and her message of peace and unity to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on forested land in Pembroke, Maine. A family member discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and alerted the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife. In a five-hour operation, a state biologist sedated the moose, and wardens used straps and an excavator provided by the family to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedative wore off, the moose ran off into the woods, seemingly unharmed. The family, previously unaware of the well, has since capped it to prevent future accidents.</p>

          <p>Health officials worldwide, including the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency, are rejecting President Trump's recent claims that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, is linked to autism when taken during pregnancy. These organizations have stated there is no consistent scientific evidence to support such a connection and reaffirmed that the medication remains an important and safe option for treating pain and fever in pregnant women. British and Australian health authorities also issued strong statements refuting the claim, emphasizing that untreated fever can pose risks to an unborn baby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This sports analysis suggests that England has assembled its most hostile group of fast bowlers for an Ashes tour in Australia since the victorious 1970-71 series. The squad, featuring pacemen like Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Josh Tongue, is designed to counter Australia's traditional strength with aggressive, high-speed bowling. The article notes that the durability of the attack is a concern, as several key bowlers have recent injury histories. Success will likely depend on a strong start in the first two Tests and the fitness of captain Ben Stokes, whose ability to bowl will be crucial for the team's balance.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball has officially approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," for the 2026 season. The system will be implemented through a challenge model, where human umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams will be given two challenges per game to have a call reviewed by the ABS technology. If a challenge is successful, the team retains it. This move, which follows years of testing in the minor leagues, is expected to increase accuracy and potentially reduce on-field arguments and ejections related to ball and strike calls.</p>

          <p>This article explains the Medigap "birthday rule," a provision in about 18 states that allows Medicare beneficiaries to switch their supplemental insurance plans annually without medical underwriting. This rule provides a specific window around a person's birthday during which they can move to a different Medigap plan with equal or lesser benefits, and insurers cannot deny them or charge more due to pre-existing conditions. For seniors, this can offer significant financial flexibility, allowing them to escape high-premium plans and choose more affordable options as their needs and budgets change over time.

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a massive aircraft order from China may be imminent as part of broader trade negotiations with the U.S., strengthening the investment case for Boeing. U.S. officials in Beijing have indicated that negotiations for a significant jet order are in their final stages. This potential deal follows a pattern where countries seeking to reduce trade deficits with the U.S. have made large purchases from Boeing. Cramer notes that recent orders from the Middle East, Japan, and Korea, coupled with the promising China talks, make the company's stock an attractive buy. (not investment advice)</p>
