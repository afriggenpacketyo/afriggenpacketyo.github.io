Canada's finance minister announced the reversal to facilitate a "mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement." The tax would have primarily impacted U.S. tech giants like Amazon and Google, and its withdrawal is seen as a significant concession to appease the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

He envisions non-invasive nanobots connecting our brains to the cloud, leading to a hybrid existence with profound implications for consciousness and longevity.
