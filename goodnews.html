          <p>Activist investment firm Sachem Head Capital Management is advocating for a merger between Performance Food Group (PFG) and US Foods, two of the largest food distribution companies in North America. The firm has nominated four new candidates to PFG's board to help explore this combination, citing potentially massive synergies of up to $1 billion. Sachem Head, which previously had a successful activist campaign at US Foods, argues that a merger of the second and third-largest industry players would be more likely to gain regulatory approval than a previous failed attempt between Sysco and US Foods.

          <p>Shares of UnitedHealth Group have risen nearly 30% since Berkshire Hathaway disclosed its purchase of over 5 million shares in the second quarter. However, it is unclear if Warren Buffett's firm is currently profitable on the investment, as the exact purchase price within the quarter is unknown. Depending on the timing, Berkshire's position could be significantly in the red or showing a substantial gain. The article also notes that Buffett has fallen to #9 on the Forbes 400 list, primarily due to his extensive philanthropic donations of Berkshire stock over the years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article tells the story of Elissa Kalver, who was diagnosed with incurable HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer at age 34, shortly after becoming a mother. Initially given a low five-year survival rate, she has now lived with the disease for four years, navigating aggressive treatments and clinical trials that have kept the cancer, including tumors in her brain, under control. Despite the constant challenges of treatment, Kalver has focused on 'living, not just surviving,' by launching a nonprofit for cancer patients and becoming an advocate. Her story highlights both the harsh realities of the disease and the medical advances offering new hope.</p>

          <p>A loan estimate document for a home purchased by Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook shows she declared the Atlanta property as a 'vacation home,' potentially countering allegations of mortgage fraud. The Trump administration has accused Cook of improperly claiming two different homes, in Michigan and Georgia, as her primary residence to secure better mortgage and tax terms. However, this document, issued by her credit union before the purchase, indicates she informed the lender of its intended secondary use. This evidence, along with her not claiming a primary residence tax exemption in Georgia, appears to support her defense against the accusations.</p>

          <p>Fast-food giants like McDonald's are losing breakfast customers to a growing competitor: food-focused convenience stores. According to market research, morning meal traffic to chains like Wawa and Casey's General Store grew 9% recently, while fast-food traffic rose only 1%. These convenience stores are successfully adopting fast-food strategies, offering a wider variety of fresh, made-to-order options that appeal to budget-conscious consumers. As fast-food chains report that breakfast is their weakest and most economically sensitive daypart, convenience stores are capturing a larger slice of the morning meal market by emphasizing quality and value.</p>

          <h2>OpenAI's Massive Spending on Cloud Computing Fuels Record Gains for Tech Giants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The artificial intelligence company OpenAI is driving a significant portion of the tech industry's growth through its massive spending on cloud computing and custom processors. Oracle's stock saw a historic surge after revealing a multibillion-dollar contract with OpenAI, which reportedly plans to spend $300 billion on computing power over five years. Similarly, companies like Broadcom, Microsoft, and Nvidia have seen their market caps swell by trillions since the launch of ChatGPT. While this spending spree is fueling a market rally, some analysts express concern over the industry's heavy reliance on a single, cash-burning startup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Travel Experts Advise Flexibility as the Key to Securing Cheaper Airfare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Google Flights and other travel experts, the single most effective strategy for finding affordable airfare is to be flexible with travel dates. Flying mid-week—on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday—is typically 13% cheaper than flying on the weekend, which can save travelers an average of $42 per domestic ticket. Contrary to popular myth, the day of the week a ticket is purchased has a negligible impact on price. Experts also recommend traveling during a destination's off-season or shoulder season and considering flights with layovers, which can reduce costs by an average of 22%.</p>

          <p>Obtaining a COVID-19 vaccine has become more challenging this year, as the FDA has narrowed its approval to specific high-risk groups, including those 65 and older and individuals with certain underlying health conditions. This marks a significant change from previous years when the vaccine was available to nearly everyone. The shift means many younger, healthy individuals may be turned away at pharmacies, though some may be able to 'self-attest' to having a risk factor. The article provides a guide to the new eligibility criteria, the status of vaccines for children, and the potential insurance coverage issues pending new CDC recommendations.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright has officially disbanded the department's Climate Working Group (CWG), a panel of scientists known for questioning the consensus on climate change. The group produced a report that was heavily criticized by independent scientists for containing errors and misrepresenting climate science. The report was used by the Trump administration to support efforts to roll back regulations on climate pollution. Environmental groups had filed a lawsuit alleging the group was formed in secret and violated federal law, and they are seeking to have the court invalidate the group's report entirely.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam, Germany, is examining the complex cultural and social legacy of the 'Plattenbau,' the prefabricated concrete slab apartment blocks that defined much of the urban landscape in the former East Germany (GDR). Initially promoted as a socialist utopian solution to a post-war housing crisis, these buildings later became symbols of dystopia and social decay following German reunification. The exhibition, 'Wohnkomplex,' explores this dual identity through art, reflecting on the buildings as spaces of community, memory, and painful transformation. It is part of a renewed cultural interest in reassessing the architectural heritage of the GDR.</p>

          <p>The German language is experiencing a surge in popularity in Turkey, driven by young people seeking better educational and career opportunities abroad. Amid a difficult economic situation in Turkey, Germany has become a prime destination for higher education, with some elite Turkish high schools now sending nearly all their graduates to German universities. This high demand has led to a shortage of German language teachers in Turkey. The trend reflects a desire among Turkish youth to gain skills that open doors to the German job market and academic world, which is seen as offering greater stability and freedom.</p>
