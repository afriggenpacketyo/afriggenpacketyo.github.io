          <p>Former footballer and presenter Gary Lineker has won the Best TV Presenter award at the National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's 'Match of the Day' after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by highlighting the importance of using one's platform to speak for the voiceless. Other notable winners at the ceremony included the finale of 'Gavin and Stacey' for best comedy and the Netflix hit 'Adolescence' for best new drama.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual after a significant surge in Oracle's stock price. Ellison's net worth reached $393 billion following a more than 40% jump in the company's shares, driven by a strong outlook for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. Although Musk later reclaimed the top spot as Oracle's stock gains moderated, the shift highlights the intense market enthusiasm for companies capitalizing on the AI boom. Ellison, a known ally of President Trump, has also been involved in potential media acquisitions, including TikTok.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has offered her review of the 2006 film 'The Devil Wears Prada,' which was based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie a 'fair shot,' praising its humor, wit, and Meryl Streep's 'fantastic' portrayal of the demanding editor Miranda Priestly. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, unaware of the film's specific content but ultimately appreciating the final product. The review comes as a sequel to the film is in production, with a planned release in 2026.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for potential interest rate cuts, some financial analysts are advising savers to consider renewing their maturing certificates of deposit (CDs). Despite the prospect of lower rates, current CD offerings remain competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, and many banks may have already factored in the anticipated cuts. Locking in a high rate now can protect savings from the impact of future rate reductions over the term of the CD. (not investment advice)</p>

The company plans to employ around 200 people at the site to test and advance its robotics and automation capabilities, with most tests occurring indoors. Some outdoor test flights, reaching up to 150 feet, are also planned within a gated area.

          <p>Shares of Oracle experienced a historic surge, climbing nearly 36% after the company reported an astounding backlog of performance obligations driven by massive demand for its cloud and AI services. The rally added $244 billion to Oracle's market capitalization, marking its best single-day performance since 1992. The company's remaining performance obligations reached $455 billion, far exceeding analyst expectations and cementing its position as a major player in the AI infrastructure market. The surge also significantly boosted the net worth of founder Larry Ellison.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for the first time in 19 months during a 54-minute private meeting at Clarence House. The reunion occurred during the Duke of Sussex's four-day visit to the UK for charity commitments, while the King was in London for his ongoing cancer treatment. While brief, the meeting is seen as a potential step toward reconciliation in their strained relationship. During his visit, Prince Harry also privately visited Queen Elizabeth II's grave but did not meet with his estranged brother, Prince William.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced that its Perseverance rover collected a rock sample on Mars that contains potential biosignatures, the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was gathered from an ancient river valley in Jezero Crater and exhibits mineral patterns and textures often associated with microbial life on Earth. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, the finding is a significant step in the quest to determine if Mars once hosted life. The next critical phase involves bringing the samples back to Earth for more detailed analysis.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, arguing it prioritizes profit over genuine fans. Mamdani contends that the pricing model will make tickets unaffordable for many and could diminish the atmosphere at the games. He is calling for FIFA to end the practice, set aside a percentage of tickets for local residents, and cap resale prices, similar to policies in place for past tournaments. The move aligns with Mamdani's broader political focus on affordability in the city.</p>

          <p>A widespread bus strike that was set to disrupt dozens of routes across London over the weekend has been mostly called off. The Unite union confirmed that the majority of its members, employed by London United, accepted a new pay offer, averting their planned walkout. However, negotiations are still ongoing with another operator, London Transit. If an agreement is not reached, some limited industrial action may still affect a small number of routes in the city, providing some relief to commuters after a week of significant travel disruption from a separate London Underground strike.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report from the China-Brazil Business Council highlights the deep economic integration between the two nations, with bilateral trade growing nearly fivefold in two decades. While export-related jobs offered higher salaries, the impact of imports was found to be more widespread across Brazilian industries and communities. However, the study also warns of the risks associated with Brazil's heavy reliance on a single trading partner and a narrow range of export commodities.</p>
