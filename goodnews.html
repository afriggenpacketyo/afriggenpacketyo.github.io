          <p>Germany and Israel are marking six decades of postwar diplomatic ties, a relationship still complex due to the Holocaust's memory and current tensions in Gaza. Israeli President Herzog is visiting Berlin to commemorate the anniversary with German President Steinmeier, including a visit to the "Platform 17" Holocaust memorial. The visit occurs during Chancellor Merz's new government, which acknowledges Germany's responsibility for Israel's security. Despite growing criticism of Israeli actions in Gaza, German politicians maintain Israel's right to defend itself following the Hamas attacks, although the relationship is complicated by the ICC's arrest warrants against Netanyahu. The visit underscores the delicate balance Germany must strike between supporting Israel and upholding international law.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's investments in Africa's energy sector, including renewables, totaled $66 billion, with Africa becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. Exports of Chinese solar and wind tech to Africa surged 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This trend aligns with China's global shift from fossil fuels to renewables, following its 2021 commitment to halt funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.</p>

          <p>Ree Drummond, the "Pioneer Woman" star, recently discussed her recommitment to her health journey after regaining weight following a year-long break from her routine. Drummond, who initially lost over 50 pounds in 2021, found herself needing to restart her plan at the end of 2023. She is now focusing on building muscle through exercises like lunges and deadlifts, while also increasing her protein intake. Drummond is no longer weighing her food or counting calories, relying instead on the awareness she gained from her previous efforts and she is using the Happy Scale app to track her progress.</p>

          <p>In this guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues against the idea of a perfect mother, stating that it can be harmful to both mothers and children. She emphasizes that flaws are an essential part of motherhood, teaching children to accept their own imperfections and understand that relationships are not one-way. Dr. Ross criticizes the tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, highlighting the importance of recognizing and appreciating the efforts of mothers, and the author also provides a quiz to show mothers that they are good enough.</p>

          <p>Sany Heavy Industry, a major Chinese heavy equipment manufacturer, plans to utilize up to US$1.5 billion from a proposed Hong Kong IPO to support global expansion. The company aims to double its overseas revenue to 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion) within three years, focusing on developing countries in Asia-Pacific, South America, and Africa. This expansion will prioritize localized marketing channels rather than building new factories. Sany is one of many Chinese companies seeking Hong Kong listings amid improved market sentiment and potential tariff escalations.</p>

          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated the redevelopment of a two-kilometer expressway surrounding the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians, expected to be completed by the 2040s. The Tokyo Sky Corridor will replace the Tokyo Expressway, commonly known as the "KK Line," which was built on rooftops and opened in 1966. The walkway, modeled after New York City's High Line, will feature soil, trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, cafes, and food trucks. The project, estimated to cost 14 billion yen ($97 million), faces challenges such as heat countermeasures and structural weight concerns.</p>
