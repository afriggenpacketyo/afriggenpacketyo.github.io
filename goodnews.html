          <p>The White House has released a new official portrait of President Trump, featuring deeper shadowing and a red tie, replacing the earlier portrait from January. The previous portrait showed Trump with brighter lighting and a blue tie, set against an American flag backdrop, while the new version features a black backdrop. Both photographs were taken by chief White House photographer Daniel Torok. The updated portrait will be used in federal buildings and offices, with the White House sharing a video of the portrait being hung in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The reasons for the update were not explicitly stated, but it marks a subtle shift in the official image of the president.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering information about songs parents sing to their babies, prompted by a Yale University study highlighting the positive impact of singing on infants' moods and well-being. The study found that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Researchers surveyed parents about their babies' crying and happiness levels, dividing them into groups that either increased singing or maintained their routines. The study suggests that any song, not just traditional lullabies, can benefit a baby by providing the opportunity to hear a parent's voice. NPR encourages parents to share their experiences and recordings of singing to their babies for a potential segment on Morning Edition.</p>

The lawmakers said farmers rely on USDA field offices for loans, grants, technical assistance, and in-person meetings with USDA staff, and that ‚Äúclosing these vital centers will make it more difficult for farmers to access the essential resources farmers must be able to rely on.‚Äù</p>
