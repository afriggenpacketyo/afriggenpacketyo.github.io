          <p>In a significant display of solidarity, several European and NATO leaders will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his meeting with U.S. President Trump. The move is seen as an effort to support Zelenskyy and prevent a recurrence of a previous tense encounter with Trump in the Oval Office. This united front, which includes the leaders of the European Commission and NATO, aims to ensure European interests are represented in any U.S.-brokered peace talks with Russia. The collective presence underscores Europe's commitment to Ukraine's position amid ongoing diplomatic efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion article, the author reflects on the nature of peace, contrasting the world's conditional peace with the steadfast peace offered by faith. The author recounts an experience during a flight cancellation at a chaotic airport, where the calmest person was a baby being cared for by its mother. This scene is used as a metaphor for the tranquility one can find by trusting in God's presence and protection, much like the infant felt secure in its mother's arms. The article suggests that true peace is not dependent on external circumstances but is a gift available through faith.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by over 10,000 of its flight attendants, which had caused hundreds of cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board mandated that staff return to work and referred the dispute to binding arbitration, a move the union criticized as "caving to corporate pressure." Flight attendants were striking for higher salaries and pay for ground time, issues that will now be settled by a government-appointed arbitrator. The airline cautioned that it will take several days for its schedule to fully return to normal.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island, off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been painstakingly renovated into a unique luxury property and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned island in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. The historic 100-man fort is now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and even its own nightclub. The project stands as a remarkable tribute to both Victorian engineering and modern restoration.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her successful comeback from a torn ACL to the practice of creating vision boards and maintaining a positive mindset. During her 13-month recovery, the No. 2 draft pick used collages of her goals and personal aspirations to stay focused and combat the mental strain of rehabilitation. This practice of manifestation and visualization, encouraged by teammate Dearica Hamby, helped her stay connected to her ambitions when she couldn't be on the court. Her strong return to the game is seen as a testament to her mental fortitude and patient, intentional approach to recovery.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued in a dramatic helicopter operation after being trapped for two days behind a waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the powerful current pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, search crews used a drone to locate him and a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted him to safety. Wardwell survived the ordeal with only minor injuries and dehydration, marking a stunning story of survival.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the cost of attending some U.S. colleges approaches $100,000 per year, a small number of institutions offer a completely tuition-free education. These nine schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have high academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for free tuition, students may participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. These colleges provide an alternative path to higher education for students concerned about affordability and debt, though admission is highly selective. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an effort to unify a team with many new players and coaches, UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal and vulnerable stories about their lives and careers, leading to what Foster described as "a lot of tears." The goal was to build trust and a collective mindset by encouraging players to lower their guards after seeing the coaching staff do the same. This focus on emotional connection is part of the team's new "We over me" motto for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm but continues to pose a significant threat with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph. The storm is currently bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, causing power outages and flood watches. While Erin is expected to re-intensify after completing a natural weakening cycle, current forecast models show it turning north and steering between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast. However, dangerous surf and rip currents are still anticipated along the eastern U.S. coastline this week.</p>

          <p>A program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas has enabled a small group of elderly parents to obtain temporary U.S. visas to reunite with their undocumented children, some of whom they haven't seen in decades. The article follows the emotional reunion of José Antonio Rodríguez and his parents in East Los Angeles after nearly 25 years apart. This novel program provides a rare opportunity for families separated by immigration status to reconnect. However, the joy is bittersweet, as many other families' visa applications were denied amid a stricter U.S. immigration climate.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was astonished to discover that his trail camera had captured footage of a brown bear, a species once thought to be extinct in the country. The sighting in the Šalčininkai district is one of several recent appearances that suggest the species may be returning to the local ecosystem. Brown bears play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by regulating prey populations and dispersing seeds. This rare documentation highlights the value of trail cameras in monitoring wildlife and provides an encouraging sign for the region's biodiversity and conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>A rare sighting of a humpback whale off the coast of Kent, England, has generated excitement among local wildlife experts and volunteers. Humpback whale populations are recovering after being endangered, and such sightings indicate the improving health of their Atlantic migration routes. These whales are crucial to ocean ecosystems, helping control prey populations and sequestering large amounts of carbon. While threats like ghost netting and ship strikes remain, the presence of the whale is seen as a positive sign, prompting calls for greater protection of marine habitats in the area.</p>

          <p>The NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue) neighborhood in Washington, D.C., once an industrial area known as "Swampoodle," has been transformed into a showcase for YIMBY ("Yes In My Back Yard") principles. Through redevelopment that began in the 1990s, the area has embraced dense, mixed-use construction, adding thousands of new housing units and commercial spaces. This pro-development approach stands in contrast to the often-restrictive zoning and NIMBY ("Not In My Back Yard") opposition seen in many other urban areas. NoMa's evolution serves as a case study in how targeted urban planning can revitalize a neighborhood and increase housing supply.</p>

          <p>Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong, has been granted asylum in Australia. Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 after facing criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted with a police bounty. In a social media post, he expressed gratitude to the Australian government for the protection but also conveyed sadness about being a political refugee unable to return home. He urged Australia to continue advocating for other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong.</p>
