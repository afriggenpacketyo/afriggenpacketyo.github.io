          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. The agreement ensures passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the system at London's St Pancras station for Eurostar passengers. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy emphasized that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Gibraltar's Chief Minister Fabian Picardo highlighted the collaborative effort with the UK government to secure the agreement. While most parties welcomed the deal, some criticized it as a surrender of territory, underscoring the complexities of the agreement.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and China have reached a deal regarding rare earth minerals and magnets, which are crucial for manufacturing various products. According to Trump, China will supply U.S. companies with these materials, while the U.S. will ease restrictions on visas for Chinese students. The agreement follows two days of negotiations in London aimed at resolving trade conflicts between the two countries. While details remain limited, officials indicate that the deal will not significantly alter the existing May truce, which had reduced some tariffs but not eliminated them entirely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Entering a romantic relationship can often lead to a decline in friendships, as cultural norms prioritize romantic partnerships over platonic bonds. Society often places unnecessary limits on friendship, with fewer legal protections and cultural emphasis compared to marriage. The expectation that a romantic partner should fulfill all emotional needs can strain friendships, leading to feelings of jealousy and loss when a friend becomes coupled. However, prioritizing both love and friendship is possible by reimagining free time and recognizing the distinct roles individuals play in one's life.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. tariff levels on Chinese imports will not change from their current levels, even though a trade deal has not been finalized. President Donald Trump had previously mentioned a 55% tariff rate on China, which a White House official clarified is the sum of existing blanket tariffs and specific product tariffs. The announcement follows high-level trade talks in London, where Trump claimed a deal was "done" but subject to final approval. China's tariffs on the U.S. will remain at 10%, as agreed upon in a previous agreement.</p>
