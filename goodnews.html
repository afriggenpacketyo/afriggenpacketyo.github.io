          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's welfare reform package, stating it strikes the "right balance" after facing a significant rebellion from his own Labour MPs. The initial plan aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce welfare spending but was altered to apply only to new claimants following internal pressure. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit and will fast-track a ¬£1 billion support package to help people find work. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs still plan to vote against the bill, citing concerns over a "two-tier" system.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.17 trillion, many consumers are exploring relief options like debt settlement, but experts caution it may not be effective for very large balances. While there's no official cap, settlement becomes increasingly difficult and risky for debts exceeding $100,000. Creditors are less likely to negotiate on large amounts, the required lump-sum savings can be unrealistic, and fees from debt relief companies become substantial. The article suggests that debt settlement is often best for those with $7,500 to $75,000 in debt, and that alternatives like consolidation loans or credit counseling might be better for overwhelming balances.

          <p>A new book and an accompanying essay in The Atlantic explore Toni Morrison's influential career as a book editor at Random House in the 1970s, before she achieved global fame as a novelist. During her time in publishing, she championed a generation of Black writers, including Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton, insisting on preserving their uncompromising visions while holding them to the highest literary standards. Morrison believed that literature written for a Black audience did not need to cater to white readers to be universally recognized for its brilliance. Her work as an editor helped prove there was a broad market for Black literature and established a legacy of authentic, powerful storytelling.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the Universal Service Fund, a crucial program that subsidizes internet and phone service for rural and underserved communities, in a 6-3 decision. Conservative groups had challenged the program, arguing that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its taxing power to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which administers the fund. However, the court's majority, in an opinion written by Justice Elena Kagan, rejected this argument. The ruling ensures continued funding for telecommunications access for schools, libraries, rural healthcare providers, and low-income households, and it pushes back against legal efforts to limit the delegating authority of Congress.</p>

          <p>Ram Trucks CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, is leading an aggressive turnaround plan to revive the Stellantis brand after years of declining sales. The strategy includes over 25 announcements through 2026, such as reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading warranty. Ram's market share in the crucial full-size pickup segment has fallen significantly since 2019, a situation Kuniskis attributes to pricing issues and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500. The new plan aims to restore the brand's market share and profitability in the highly competitive truck market.</p>
