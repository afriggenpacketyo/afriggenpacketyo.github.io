        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luckin Coffee, which has surpassed Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain, is now expanding into the United States with several locations already open in New York City. The company operates with a cashier-less, app-based model that relies heavily on deep discounts and coupons to attract customers and build brand awareness. While this strategy has fueled rapid growth, analysts note that its initial US stores are operating at a loss, a stark contrast to Starbucks's focus on per-store profitability. Luckin is also working to rebuild its reputation after a 2020 accounting fraud scandal led to its delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:54:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sources familiar with negotiations indicate that technology company Oracle is part of a consortium that would allow TikTok to continue its US operations under a new framework deal between the United States and China. While the exact structure remains unclear, the agreement involves multiple companies, though the level of control by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is still being determined. This development follows a 2024 law requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban, a measure President Trump has repeatedly delayed. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to manage US user data, and its co-founder Larry Ellison is known to be a friend of the president.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok be banned in the United States was the critical factor that compelled China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that the president made it clear that national security concerns would not be compromised for the sake of a commercial agreement. The commercial terms of the deal between parent company ByteDance and new investors had been largely settled for months but were put on hold by China after a major tariff announcement by Trump. A final agreement is expected to be reached in an upcoming call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has released promising late-stage trial data for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide, which could become a successor to its popular drug Wegovy. The phase 3 trial showed that patients taking the once-weekly injection achieved an average weight loss of 11.8% after 68 weeks, significantly more than the placebo group. Cagrilinitide works differently from existing GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, acting as a long-acting amylin analogue to increase feelings of fullness. The treatment was also described as well-tolerated, with mainly mild gastrointestinal side effects, a key factor as the company seeks alternatives for patients.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials and bodies to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The Public Office (Accountability) Bill includes a "duty of candour," with potential criminal sanctions for those who fail to comply, and will also provide legal funding for victims. Prime Minister Keir Starmer praised the families of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster victims, whose persistent campaigning led to the legislation. The law is intended to prevent cover-ups and learn from other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, across various sites in Southeast Asia. The human remains, found in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks, were likely preserved through a process of smoke-drying over a fire by ancient hunter-gatherer communities. This practice, which predates the famous Egyptian and Chinchorro mummies by thousands of years, is believed to have allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors. The findings suggest this funerary tradition may have been widespread across the region, with similar practices still found in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to reveal its most advanced smart glasses to date, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect conference this week. The new device reportedly features a small display and can be controlled by hand gestures via a neural-interface wristband, representing a significant step beyond its current Ray-Ban camera glasses. This launch marks a strategic shift from virtual reality headsets toward a more mass-market wearable, as the company's Reality Labs division continues to post billions in losses. Investors will be watching closely to see if the new product can generate consumer buzz and demonstrate progress toward a return on Meta's massive metaverse investment.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the legendary "Thrilla in Manila," the third and final boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier is remembered as a brutal pinnacle of the sport that explored the limits of human endurance. The fight, held on October 1, 1975, was the culmination of a bitter, personal rivalry that had captivated the world. Staged in the Philippines under the autocratic regime of Ferdinand Marcos, the event was a global spectacle broadcast by satellite, showcasing both the beauty and the ugliness of boxing. The article recounts the fight's intensity and the deep-seated animosity between the two champions, whose relationship soured from friendship to profound enmity.</p>

          <p>New government figures reveal that the number of people receiving winter fuel payments fell from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year after a controversial policy change. The Treasury had decided to means-test the payment, restricting it to pensioners on low-income benefits like pension credit. However, following a significant backlash, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a U-turn in June. The policy has now been revised so that pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will be eligible, restoring the payment for over three-quarters of pensioners for the upcoming winter to help them cover rising energy bills.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, scientists have definitively identified the source of a vibrant turquoise blue color in Jackson Pollock's iconic 1948 painting, "Number 1A, 1948." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, researchers created a chemical fingerprint confirming the pigment is manganese blue, a synthetic color once used by artists but phased out by the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This discovery not only provides new insight into the materials used by the abstract expressionist but also showcases how scientific techniques can be used to conserve and authenticate historical artworks. The research helps to understand the methodical process behind Pollock's seemingly chaotic "action painting" style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings growth data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the government's "triple lock" policy, the pension increases annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5%. This likely increase would raise the new state pension by over £500 a year, bringing it to £12,534.60 annually. However, as the personal tax allowance remains frozen at £12,570, this raise will push more pensioners into paying income tax for the first time, a growing concern for retirees.
