          <p>South Carolina Medicaid's decision to cover GLP-1s for obesity treatment offers hope to some beneficiaries, while a federal mandate is not yet in place. The Trump administration has decided not to finalize a rule that would have allowed millions more to access these drugs, citing cost concerns. Despite South Carolina's coverage, stringent prerequisites limit access to a small fraction of the state's obese population, and beneficiaries must prove they have tried and failed to lose weight through other means. Public health experts applaud the decision, but acknowledge that more work is needed to address obesity rates comprehensively.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to push for the passage of a budget package containing his legislative priorities, but faces opposition from dueling factions within the party. Conservatives are demanding deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates are resisting cuts to the program and seeking adjustments to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Trump has urged Republicans to support the bill and not let division over SALT or Medicaid derail it, while reiterating that any cuts to Medicaid would only target waste, fraud, and abuse. House Speaker Mike Johnson is working to gather subgroups and resolve remaining issues to pass the bill before the Memorial Day deadline.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using SNAP benefits, marking a shift in federal nutrition policy. The state will implement the program starting in January 2026, affecting approximately 150,000 food stamp recipients. The decision adds to existing restrictions on SNAP benefits, which already exclude hot foods, nonfood items, alcohol, and tobacco. Other states, including Iowa, Arkansas, and Kansas, are also seeking similar waivers, potentially signaling a broader trend in restricting unhealthy food purchases with food stamps.</p>

          <p>The recent tariff truce between the U.S. and China has generated cautious optimism in the global economy, signaling a potential step back from a damaging trade decoupling. While the U.S. has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to around 50%, the remaining tariffs still pose a significant challenge to bilateral trade. However, the truce suggests that neither side is willing to completely sever economic ties, offering hope for future resolutions on issues like fentanyl. Many business leaders anticipate that tariffs on Chinese goods will either hold steady or decrease further after the 90-day period.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported strong earnings and revenue growth, exceeding Wall Street expectations, but its stock fell in extended trading because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics. CEO Nikesh Arora highlights customer adoption of next-generation security products as critical for future growth in cloud computing and AI. The company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR slightly exceeded estimates, but the full-year outlook was unchanged, leading to investor disappointment.

He noted that certain stocks, particularly those related to "fickle consumers" and banks, are more sensitive to bond market fluctuations. Cramer highlighted GE Vernova as a company that can withstand bond market pressures due to multiple secular trends, including the increasing need for energy from data centers and new projects. He emphasized that GE Vernova has secular trends going for it, and that's what is needed to buck the bond voters.</p>
