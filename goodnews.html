          <p>According to royal experts, Kate Middleton's success as a modern royal is due to her adherence to royal rules and traditions, a stark contrast to Princess Diana's more rebellious approach. Unlike Diana, who married Prince Charles at a young age and faced immense press scrutiny, Kate was older and more prepared when she married Prince William. Royal experts suggest that Kate learned from Diana's experiences, avoiding the pitfalls of rushing into royal life and maintaining a focus on duty. This article highlights the support system Kate has, including her family and Prince William, which Diana lacked, enabling her to navigate royal life with greater ease and stability.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached a temporary agreement to significantly ease tariffs imposed in recent months, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. Both countries will reduce reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, providing a window for further negotiations to address economic and trade concerns. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the temporary reductions would lower U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China would reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. This move has buoyed commodities and currency markets, offering hope for a more balanced trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (PKK), a Kurdish militia group, has announced its intention to lay down arms and disband, a decision that could significantly alter Turkish politics and regional dynamics. This announcement follows calls from the PKK's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who urged the group to disarm and pursue Kurdish rights through political means. The PKK's statement echoes Ocalan's sentiment, suggesting that the group has fulfilled its mission by elevating the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be resolved through democratic politics. This move could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and potentially expand President Erdogan's support among Kurds.</p>

This announcement triggered a sell-off in pharmaceutical stocks amid concerns about potential profit declines.
