          <p>Organizers of the Women's Euro 2025 in Switzerland are intensifying efforts to combat discrimination, building on initiatives from the men's Euro 2024. UEFA and Swiss authorities have committed to prioritizing diversity, inclusion, and human rights, establishing a human rights advisory board earlier in the process than the men's tournament. New measures include in-stadium "awareness teams" and a QR code system for reporting incidents, along with a continued focus on combating online cyberbullying, which targeted players with sexist and hateful posts in previous tournaments. These steps aim to create a safer environment for both players and fans, with a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination and sexual violence.</p>

          <p>Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has declared that a permanent Chinese military presence is not welcome in the South Pacific, emphasizing a desire for the region to remain an "ocean of peace." Speaking in Australia, Rabuka stated that Fiji would not welcome such a development and believes China understands this position. He stressed that Pacific nations aim to maintain friendly policies with all global powers without becoming a stage for superpower rivalries. This statement comes as China continues to expand its economic and diplomatic influence in the region, including a security pact with the Solomon Islands that has raised concerns about potential military basing.</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced the deployment of its one-millionth robot across its global facilities, reinforcing its status as a leader in mobile robotics. The company also launched a new generative AI model called "DeepFleet" to coordinate its robotic fleet, which it claims will improve efficiency and speed up deliveries. While Amazon states that these robots handle repetitive tasks and create new technical roles for human employees, the expansion comes amid growing concerns about job automation. CEO Andy Jassy has acknowledged that AI will lead to fewer people in certain roles, and the company has already conducted significant layoffs in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A veterinarian in Wisconsin has successfully saved a severely injured American bald eagle using an innovative procedure involving grafts made from cod skin. The eagle, named Kere, was found with its leg ripped open and a deep infection, and was initially considered a candidate for euthanasia. Dr. Kimberly Ammann of the Winged Freedom Raptor Hospital used sterilized fish skin patches, typically used on human wounds, to repair the damage. After a ten-month rehabilitation, the eagle made a full recovery. Kere was released back into the wild in late June, a symbolic event ahead of the Fourth of July holiday celebrating the nation's emblem of freedom.</p>

          <p>New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign has successfully integrated ambitious climate policy with a core message of affordability, a model supporters believe can build broad popular support. Instead of focusing on complex, technocratic plans, Mamdani's platform features tangible benefits like free bus transit and a rent freeze. These policies are framed not only as cost-of-living solutions but also as climate action, by boosting public transit ridership and preventing urban sprawl. This approach aims to learn from past efforts by connecting green policies to immediate, material improvements in the lives of working-class residents, thereby creating a stronger political base to defend them.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is offering residents the chance to fish without a license on two designated days this summer, July 5th and August 30th. The initiative aims to provide a low-cost opportunity for people to try the sport and enjoy the state's natural resources. While the license fee is waived, all other fishing regulations, such as size and bag limits, and specific report card requirements for certain species like salmon, will remain in effect. The program is part of a broader effort to balance public access with the conservation of California's fish populations, some of which, like the steelhead trout, remain threatened.</p>

          <p>A new state law in California that took effect this week requires all establishments serving alcohol for on-site consumption to provide drink lids to customers upon request. The measure, Assembly Bill 2375, is intended as a tool to help prevent drink spiking. This legislation builds on a previous law that mandated these venues to post signs informing patrons about the availability of drug-testing kits. Bar owners have indicated the cost of providing the lids is insignificant, and the law allows them to charge a "reasonable" price if they choose. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control will enforce the new rule during regular inspections.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a spending plan for nearly $425 million generated by Measure ULA, the city's "mansion tax" on high-value property sales. For the 2025 fiscal year, the funds are allocated to various affordable housing and homelessness initiatives. Over $288 million will go toward the production and preservation of affordable housing, while more than $100 million is designated for homelessness prevention, including tenant income support and eviction defense programs. While the real estate industry has criticized the measure, its supporters champion it as a vital source of funding for the city's housing crisis amid state and county budget cuts.

          <p>Bruce Springsteen's recent stadium concerts in Germany and across Europe have featured a strong political message, warning against what he calls "dangerous times" in the United States. In speeches between songs, Springsteen has described the Trump administration as "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous" and called for audiences to rise up against authoritarianism. His message has resonated deeply in Germany, where historical memory of the Nazi era fuels fears about the current state of U.S. politics. The tour has been massively popular, with Springsteen using his platform to address issues of civil liberties, free speech, and the defense of democracy to hundreds of thousands of fans.</p>
