          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has revealed the deep frustration he felt during the team's difficult 2024-25 season, admitting he often went to games fearing his side would not be competitive. After replacing Erik ten Hag, Amorim oversaw a poor run of form, culminating in a Europa League final loss. However, he now expresses renewed belief, citing a cultural shift within the club where he has implemented stricter rules and a new player leadership group to uphold standards. Amorim states that the club's decision to retain him despite the poor results shows their support, and he aims to manage the team for 20 years.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the 'Darwin Monkey,' which they claim is the world's first brain-like computer to feature over 2 billion artificial neurons. This new system is built using 960 proprietary Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, creating a complex network of more than 100 billion synapses. The university announced that this advancement represents a significant step toward achieving more sophisticated, human-like artificial intelligence. The Darwin Monkey has already been successfully used to perform advanced tasks, including content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematical calculations, powered by a brain-like large model from the Chinese AI firm DeepSeek.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but stoic on-course demeanor, is receiving praise for a humorous cameo in the new movie 'Happy Gilmore 2'. The article suggests that while Scheffler's consistent excellence can sometimes lack drama for viewers, his self-effacing performance in the film presents a more relatable and fun-loving personality. In the movie, Scheffler plays along with a narrative referencing his real-life arrest earlier this year, showing a willingness to poke fun at himself. This appearance is seen as a positive move for both his personal brand and the sport of golf, making him more engaging to a wider audience.</p>

          <p>As major donors like the United States and the United Kingdom reduce their foreign aid budgets, a few other countries, notably Spain, are increasing their commitments to global development. The article highlights a projected $56 billion funding gap in global aid by 2025, which threatens progress against poverty and disease. Spain, once a recipient of bailout funds, has pledged to more than double its aid budget by 2030, joined by smaller increases from Ireland, South Korea, and Italy. This shift could lead to a more collaborative, less paternalistic future for foreign aid, driven by nations with more recent experiences of underdevelopment themselves.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of demonstrators, including recently freed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in a large pro-Palestinian protest. The 'March for Humanity' called for a ceasefire and increased aid for Gaza, with protesters carrying pots and pans to symbolize the hunger crisis. The event proceeded despite rainy weather and initial opposition from police, who raised safety concerns. A Supreme Court ruling authorized the march, which highlighted growing public pressure on the Australian government to take a stronger stance on the conflict and potentially recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>A recent study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that seismic activity may be a key energy source for microbial life in Earth's deep biosphere. This vast, hidden ecosystem is estimated to contain up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass, but how it survives in such isolated, nutrient-poor environments has been a mystery. The research proposes that earthquakes generate hydrogen gas from fractured rocks and water, providing the chemical energy necessary to sustain these deep-dwelling prokaryotes. This finding offers a new understanding of the mechanisms that support life in the planet's darkest and most extreme depths.</p>

          <h2>Voters in California Swing District Show Bipartisan Support for Release of Epstein Files</h2>

          <p>In California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District, voters from across the political spectrum are united in their demand for the full release of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Despite deep divisions on other issues concerning President Trump, both his supporters and detractors expressed a belief in transparency regarding the sex-trafficking case. Many voters recalled Trump's campaign promises to release the files and now view any hesitation as backpedaling. The consensus in this key political battleground suggests a broad, bipartisan expectation that the government should reveal all known information about Epstein, his crimes, and his powerful associates.</p>

          <p>Peter Guralnick's new biography, 'The Colonel and the King,' offers a comprehensive look at Colonel Tom Parker, the controversial longtime manager of Elvis Presley. The book delves into Parker's hidden past as an undocumented Dutch immigrant named Andreas Cornelis van Kuijk and his early life as a carnival hustler, experiences that shaped his formidable promotional skills. Rather than simply painting him as a villain who exploited Elvis, Guralnick presents a more nuanced portrait, using extensive research to contextualize Parker's decisions, including his infamous refusal to let Elvis tour internationally. The book aims to provide a definitive account of the man who built the mighty Elvis industry.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the crucial but undramatic work George Washington undertook in the summer of 1775 to transform a chaotic assembly of colonial militias into the Continental Army. Despite his personal aversion to the 'dirty and nasty' New Englanders under his command, Washington established discipline, organization, and a sense of unified American identity. He appointed talented subordinates like Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox based on merit, not social standing, creating a truly American force. The author argues that this quiet, foundational leadership, often overlooked in favor of dramatic battles, was essential to the success of the Revolution and demonstrates Washington's true greatness.</p>

          <p>Despite heavy rain, tens of thousands of protesters, including WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, marched across the Sydney Harbour Bridge for a pro-Palestinian demonstration dubbed the 'March for Humanity'. The event, which called for a ceasefire and increased aid to Gaza, was authorized by the Supreme Court just one day prior, overcoming initial police objections due to safety and traffic concerns. Protesters chanted and carried signs urging the Australian government to take a stronger stance against the conflict and the unfolding humanitarian crisis. The march caused major traffic disruptions but proceeded peacefully, highlighting strong public sentiment on the issue in Australia.</p>

          <p>Chile is experiencing one of the world's most dramatic declines in fertility, with its birth rate now below Japan's and most of Europe's, a trend that may foreshadow the future for the United States. The article explores the societal transformation driven by factors like the high cost of living and increased educational and career opportunities for women. As in the U.S., a growing number of young Chilean women are delaying or opting out of motherhood entirely. This rapid demographic shift is creating challenges for social systems dependent on population growth and sparking a political debate between progressives who see it as progress and conservatives who view it as a cultural crisis.</p>
