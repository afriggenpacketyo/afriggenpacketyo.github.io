          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire has announced his candidacy for the 2026 Senate race, aiming to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Sununu, who previously served three terms in the House and one in the Senate before losing to Shaheen in 2008, stated his desire to "calm the waters" in a "loud, dysfunctional, even angry" Congress. He faces a primary challenge from former ambassador Scott Brown, who criticizes Sununu's past lack of support for President Donald Trump. Despite Sununu's previous opposition to Trump, national Republicans view him as a strong candidate to flip the seat, and Trump has remained neutral so far.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Eurostar has announced ambitious plans to operate double-decker trains through the Channel Tunnel for the first time, ordering up to 50 "Celestia" trains from manufacturer Alstom in a €2 billion deal. The initial six trains are slated for service by 2031, with each 200m train capable of seating 1,080 passengers when run in pairs, significantly boosting capacity. This expansion aims to increase Eurostar's annual passenger numbers from 19.5 million to 30 million, also supporting new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt. Key challenges include substantial investment in a crucial London depot to accommodate the larger fleet and a years-long certification process across all operating countries.</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Holds Steady at 3.8% as Food Price Increases Decelerate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 05:24:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in September for the third consecutive month, a figure lower than economists' expectations. Notably, the cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks experienced its slowest increase in over a year, with prices falling for the first time since May last year. However, some items like red meat and chocolate continue to rise, and Chancellor Rachel Reeves expressed dissatisfaction with the overall numbers. This September inflation figure is crucial as it typically serves as the benchmark for benefit uprating in April, meaning millions could see a 3.8% increase in payments, while the state pension is set to rise by 4.8% based on wage increases.</p>

          <p>China recently hosted an AI capacity-building workshop in Shanghai, where senior diplomat Sun Xiaobo asserted that artificial intelligence should be a culmination of human wisdom, not merely "a game for the wealthy and affluent." Foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun emphasized China's commitment to promoting inclusive AI development and global governance, aiming for modernization achievements to benefit people worldwide. Despite Beijing's portrayal of itself as a responsible force in AI, the article highlights that most Americans perceive US leadership as crucial in the field. This divergence underscores the ongoing geopolitical competition and differing national visions for AI's future and global influence.</p>

          <p>Methane (CH4), a colorless and odorless gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas, trapping 84 times more heat than CO2 over a 20-year period and contributing 20-30% of global warming since the Industrial Revolution. While natural sources like thawing permafrost exist, 60% of atmospheric methane comes from human activities, primarily agriculture (livestock, manure), landfills, and the energy sector (leaks, flaring, venting from fossil fuel production). Solutions include simple measures like fixing leaks in oil and gas infrastructure, which could reduce emissions by 75%. The EU has implemented regulations, and the UN Environment Programme uses satellites to detect and alert governments to methane leaks, though more action is needed.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral debate between state lawmaker Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo vividly showcased a generational and ideological battle within the Democratic Party. Mamdani, a young progressive, trounced Cuomo in the Democratic primary and consistently leads in general election polls, appealing to younger voters with ideas like rent freezes and free city bus service. Cuomo, a seasoned politician, criticized Mamdani's inexperience, while Mamdani countered by questioning Cuomo's integrity, referencing his 2021 resignation amid a sexual misconduct scandal. Mamdani's innovative use of social media has been a game-changer, allowing him to connect with voters and overcome traditional political disadvantages.</p>

          <p>President Trump frequently employs the phrase "common sense" in his political rhetoric, a strategy rooted in its historical populist appeal dating back to Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet. This phrase allows Trump to frame his policies and views as inherently rational and accessible to ordinary people, often contrasting them with "academic smarts" or elite positions. Political strategists note its particular resonance with rural and older voters who appreciate a simpler, less complicated past, aligning with the "Make America Great Again" sentiment. However, the article also points out that "common sense" can be a demagogic tool, implying that any opposing viewpoint is mere "nonsense" and thereby dismissing legitimate debate, which can be seen as norm-shattering.</p>

          <p>Golf legend Jack Nicklaus has won a $50 million verdict in a defamation lawsuit against his former business partners, Nicklaus Companies, in Palm Beach County, Florida. A jury found that the company had damaged the 18-time major champion's reputation. Nicklaus alleged that his partners, including executive chairman Howard Milstein, spread false stories claiming he considered joining the Saudi-backed LIV Golf League and was suffering from dementia, rendering him mentally unfit. The defense argued it was a business dispute and no harm was done to Nicklaus's reputation. This verdict follows a previous dismissal of a lawsuit by Nicklaus Companies that attempted to prevent Nicklaus from using his own name for his golf course design business.</p>
