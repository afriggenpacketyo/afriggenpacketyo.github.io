          <p>President Donald Trump met with House Republicans on Capitol Hill to advocate for the passage of his 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which recently passed a House committee vote. During the meeting, Trump urged lawmakers not to allow state and local tax deductions (SALT) to hinder the bill's progress. Concurrently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee. The White House announced that the president would also make an announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office later in the day.</p>

          <p>A Vox editor conducted an experiment by switching from a smartphone to a flip phone for a month, aiming to reduce screen time and improve real-life connections. The editor found that the absence of social media apps led to more intentional and frequent communication with friends and family, resulting in deeper connections and increased spontaneity. While the experiment had its challenges, such as stilted texting and missing out on social events, it ultimately led to a more fulfilling social life and improved attention span. The editor also reconnected with family and made more plans to visit them, appreciating off-the-cuff hangs.</p>

          <p>Kenya is working to increase its tea exports to China, with plans for China to export tea packaging material to Kenya tax-free before establishing packaging firms for the export market. President William Ruto met with Fuzhou Benny Tea Industries to discuss opportunities for Kenyan teas in China. The agreement aims to improve the production of high-quality Kenyan tea and align the country's tea industry with international market demands. Challenges such as fluctuating prices and stringent certification requirements have prompted Kenya to seek these strategic partnerships, hoping to leverage trade frameworks like the African Continental Free Trade Area and the African Growth and Opportunity Act.</p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, attributing its stability to increasing sales among home professionals, which offset slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. The home improvement retailer narrowly missed Wall Street's expectations for quarterly sales but surpassed earnings estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison highlighted that investments in stores, technology, and customer service have helped the retailer navigate near-term uncertainty in the housing market. Lowe's expects total sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion for the full year and projects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% year over year.</p>

          <p>West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to UK health officials, though the risk to the general public is considered "very low." Fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023. While there have been no human cases of West Nile virus acquired in the UK, the detection is not unexpected as the virus is already widespread in Europe. Experts say that climate change and other factors are pushing mosquitoes and the diseases they carry further north, potentially bringing non-native species and infectious diseases to the UK.</p>
