          <p>Moldova's pro-EU ruling party, led by President Maia Sandu, is set to win a clear majority in parliamentary elections, a result seen as critical for the nation's path toward joining the European Union. The election was conducted amid high tensions and warnings from Sandu about “massive Russian interference,” including disinformation campaigns and alleged plots to incite unrest. Despite these pressures and claims of victory from a pro-Russian opposition leader, the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) secured approximately 50% of the vote, ensuring it can form a government without needing a coalition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American malls and shopping centers is creating new opportunities for small, local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate. With rising vacancy rates, landlords are becoming more willing to offer flexible lease terms and lower rents, which were previously prohibitive for independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based entrepreneurs. This shift is allowing smaller enterprises to move into spaces once occupied by national chains, potentially revitalizing local economies and reshaping suburban commercial landscapes.</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Mercury have clinched a spot in the WNBA Finals after a stunning 86-81 comeback win against the top-seeded Minnesota Lynx in Game 4 of their semifinal series. Trailing by 13 points entering the fourth quarter, the Mercury mounted a furious rally, outscoring the Lynx 31-13 in the final period to secure the victory. The Lynx were notably playing without their star center, Napheesa Collier, who was sidelined with an ankle injury sustained in the previous game, hampering their ability to close out the series.</p>

          <p>For Hong Kong to achieve its goals for green marine fuels, it must establish a reliable and tax-free supply chain for green methanol, according to the president of CM Energy. While the city has already implemented LNG and biodiesel fueling, progress on methanol is needed to support the shipping industry's transition to cleaner energy. The statement was made at a ceremony for the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of operating on methanol, which is seen as a key step toward decarbonizing the maritime sector in response to Europe's carbon tariffs.</p>
