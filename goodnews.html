          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The move comes after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee for Figma. The company reported strong growth, with first-quarter revenue up 46% to $228.2 million and a net income of $44.9 million. This IPO is highly anticipated and signals a potential resurgence in the tech public offering market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law that significantly expands its anti-smoking regulations by banning smoking in most public outdoor spaces. The ban applies to areas such as beaches, parks, bus shelters, and the vicinity of schools and libraries, with violators facing fines up to 700 euros. The government's goal is to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, and combat the 75,000 tobacco-related deaths in the country each year. While smoking has been illegal in indoor public venues since 2008, this measure marks a major step in restricting it outdoors.</p>

          <p>The Senate's version of the Republican tax-and-spending package contains numerous provisions that would significantly impact American household finances. Key measures include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000, and introducing new tax breaks for tip income and overtime pay. The legislation also proposes major spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP, overhauls student loans, and creates new "Trump accounts" for child savings.

This move is part of a broader effort by Tinder's parent company, Match Group, to enhance user safety and combat the rising prevalence of romance scams.

This article analyzes how his deal compares to other massive contracts across major American sports. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to longer terms, top NBA players often have the highest annual salaries because of smaller roster sizes.

The tax would have applied to projects using components from Chinese entities and could have cost the industry up to $7 billion. While its removal provided relief, the bill still phases out key investment and production tax credits that have been crucial for the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. Industry groups described the overall legislation as a step backward for American energy policy.

The agency has been based at the J. Edgar Hoover building since 1975, but that facility has been plagued by structural issues. The move keeps the FBI in close proximity to the Department of Justice, a priority for the Trump administration, which had previously canceled a plan to move the headquarters to Maryland.
