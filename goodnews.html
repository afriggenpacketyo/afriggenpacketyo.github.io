          <p>The head of the Royal Navy, Adm Sir Ben Key, has been temporarily removed from his duties pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct, according to the Ministry of Defence. While the MoD has not released specific details regarding the allegations, reports suggest that Adm Key is suspected of having an affair with a subordinate. Earlier in the week, the MoD issued a statement saying that the First Sea Lord had "stepped back due to private reasons." The investigation is ongoing, and further comments are being withheld at this time.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested by federal authorities for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in his city. The arrest occurred after Baraka demanded to be let through a security gate at the Delaney Hall ICE facility, where protesters and members of the state's congressional caucus were gathered. Baraka's administration had previously filed a lawsuit to block the opening of the detention facility, arguing that its operators failed to obtain proper permits. Baraka was released without bond after appearing before a federal magistrate and charged with a misdemeanor count of trespassing.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been reportedly subpoenaed in the legal battle between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, although a representative for Swift has denied her involvement in the creative decisions for the film ‚ÄúIt Ends With Us.‚Äù The lawsuit began when Lively accused Baldoni of orchestrating a smear campaign after she reported on-set sexual harassment. Baldoni countersued, claiming Lively‚Äôs accusations are baseless and damaging to his career.

Alex Bonfield relocated to Manchester from Oxfordshire to afford a home. Oliver Jones used a shared ownership scheme in London and sub-lets to a friend to save money.

          <p>House Republicans have introduced the first components of a $4 trillion tax cut plan, intending to maintain key aspects of President Trump‚Äôs 2017 tax cuts while implementing more generous tax breaks for a limited time. The legislation seeks to secure the larger standard deduction and lower individual income tax rates established in 2017. Additionally, the bill proposes temporary expansions, such as adding $1,000 to the standard deduction for individuals annually until 2029 and temporarily increasing the child tax credit to $2,500 for the next four years. The bill is expected to face opposition from Democrats, who criticize the plans to cut spending on programs for the poor to finance tax cuts benefiting the wealthy.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi over a lawsuit concerning the blood thinner Plavix. The lawsuit alleged that the companies failed to update their labels regarding the risk of diminished response to Plavix in about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians. While a court had previously ordered the companies to pay $916 million, a settlement was reached for the lower amount before an appeal was decided. Neither company has admitted wrongdoing, but they have jointly stated that they are pleased to resolve the litigation.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody after a judge ruled that her continued detention could not stand, citing concerns about her First Amendment and due process rights. Ozturk was detained after the Trump administration revoked her student visa following an opinion piece she co-authored criticizing Israel's war with Hamas. Judge Sessions emphasized that Ozturk was detained solely for expressing her opinion in the op-ed, with no evidence of violence or advocating violence. The court has set a hearing for May 22 to further consider Ozturk's challenge to her confinement.</p>

Officers issue community protection warnings to men caught engaging in sexual activity with sex workers, restricting their access to certain areas. The Night Light team, a collaboration between police, Barnardo's, and the city council, offers support to street workers and gathers intelligence about at-risk youth.</p>

The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block, and reverse such land deals.

The series highlights how families spoke out about the flaws in the system, leading to reforms such as strengthened travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening. Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park says the families "made history" and a lot of the protocols introduced in the aftermath of 9/11 were based on what they campaigned for.
