          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, has been met with mixed reviews in China, where the artificial intelligence landscape is increasingly competitive. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new system as a "PhD-level expert in anything," some Chinese tech experts have been less impressed, with one analyst noting it lacks revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable features. The model is touted for its improved performance in areas like coding, math, and writing, featuring a built-in "thinking" function that switches between standard and deep modes based on query complexity, but its debut has not quelled local competition.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a major infrastructure project aimed at connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. A new company has been established to oversee the railway's construction and future operations, which will also include real estate, tourism, and international contracting. The planned 2,000-kilometer route will link Hotan to Shigatse, integrating with existing lines to form a strategic artery. This project is part of a larger goal to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity across western China.</p>

          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high mobile phone bills when abroad by employing several strategies to manage data usage and roaming fees. Options include switching to a carrier like T-Mobile, which offers international roaming in some plans, or purchasing a local or international eSIM for more affordable data rates. Experts also recommend maximizing the use of free Wi-Fi and downloading maps and other necessary information for offline use to limit cellular data consumption. While public Wi-Fi poses security risks for sensitive transactions, careful planning can significantly reduce or eliminate extra costs associated with international travel.</p>

          <p>This opinion column endorses Eric Tung, a former clerk for Justices Gorsuch and Scalia, as President Trump's nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The author, Mike Davis, praises Tung's exceptional credentials, bipartisan respect, and experience as a federal prosecutor and appellate lawyer, arguing he is a committed constitutionalist. The article criticizes Democratic senators for what it calls partisan theatrics during Tung's confirmation hearing, where they focused on the author's social media posts rather than the nominee's qualifications. The piece concludes by urging the Senate to confirm Tung to strengthen the judiciary.</p>

          <p>In a sign of easing tensions, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border, according to South Korea's military. This action follows Seoul's decision in June to halt its own broadcasts of K-pop and news reports into the North, a move initiated by President Lee Jae Myung's administration to reopen dialogue. The reciprocal measure is one of the first since President Lee took office and reversed the hard-line approach of his predecessor. The two Koreas have used cross-border loudspeaker campaigns for decades during periods of heightened military and political friction.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has revived and approved plans to build the Strait of Messina Bridge, a two-mile-long suspension bridge connecting Sicily to the mainland. The project, first conceived in 1971, is estimated to cost $15.7 billion and is slated for completion in 2032. Proponents believe it will boost the economy of southern Italy and create over 100,000 jobs. However, the project faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone, potential for corrosion, and strong opposition from local residents who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on How to Be a Considerate and Welcome Houseguest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to etiquette expert Elaine Swann, being a good houseguest involves respecting the host's space and being self-sufficient, rather than literally "making yourself at home." Key advice includes giving ample notice, keeping visits to a manageable length like four days, and communicating plans to avoid awkwardness. Guests should not rely on their hosts for transportation and should offer to help with chores or treat the host to a meal. A thoughtful gift, given by the time of departure, is also recommended to show appreciation and ensure a welcome return visit.</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Value ETF Presented as Alternative for Higher Passive Income Than S&P 500</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 04:22:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) as an option for investors seeking higher dividend yields than the broader S&P 500. With a 2.2% yield compared to the S&P 500's 1.2%, VTV offers more passive income and a lower valuation, holding a different composition of stocks focused on sectors like finance and consumer staples rather than mega-cap tech. The fund is positioned as a wealth compounder that balances capital gains with income, making it suitable for investors looking to diversify away from growth stocks while still participating in the broader market.
