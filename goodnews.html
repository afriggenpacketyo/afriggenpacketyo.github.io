          <p>Salesforce announced upbeat fiscal first-quarter results and guidance, despite President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. Revenue grew 7.6% year over year, and the company is acquiring data management firm Informatica for $8 billion, its largest acquisition since Slack. Salesforce also introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents and saw savings from internal use of its Agentforce agent. Management projects strong earnings and revenue for the next quarter and raised its full-year forecast, while reiterating guidance for subscription and support revenue growth, while anticipating weakness in marketing and commerce software revenue (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% jump in revenue to $44.1 billion, driven by strong demand for its artificial intelligence chips, despite U.S. government restrictions on sales to China. The company anticipates current quarter revenue to rise 50% to $45 billion, fueled by the expansion of its newest AI chip, Blackwell. CEO Jensen Huang stated that every nation sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution. Despite China restrictions costing the company $4.5 billion, Nvidia's market value places it as the second-most-valuable company globally.</p>

          <p>President Trump officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, confirmed the pardon and expressed gratitude to Trump and his administration. The Chrisleys were sentenced in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution. The charges stemmed from activity that occurred as early as 2007, involving false information provided to banks and fabricated financial documents.</p>

          <p>China is developing a rapid-response space defense system to intercept and redirect suspicious spacecraft that approach its Tiangong space station. According to scientist Sun Zhibin, the robotic thrusters would latch onto intruders and push them to a safer distance. This development comes after China reported evasive maneuvers by its space station to avoid potential collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites. The system aims to protect China's critical space infrastructure from interference.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the $50 billion AI chip market in China is effectively closed to the U.S. industry.
