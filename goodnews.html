          <p>Former President Biden's announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has been met with an outpouring of sympathy and well wishes, yet also some skepticism regarding the timing and transparency of his health disclosures.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was illegal. The decision declares the actions of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, as "null and void," ordering the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose. The judge stated that the administration's actions, including the removal of board members and staff, were unlawful because USIP operates independently of the executive branch. The ruling allows USIP to resume its work in promoting peace and stability around the world.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a major reset of relations, aiming to move beyond Brexit disputes. The deal covers various areas, including fishing, trade, defense, and energy, with a key component being extended access for European fishing boats to British waters in exchange for reduced trade frictions. While the government claims the deal will ease trade and boost the economy, critics argue it amounts to a surrender to the EU and compromises British sovereignty. This BBC article highlights the mixed reactions and potential implications of the agreement.</p>

          <p>A luxury Boeing 747 gifted by Qatar to the U.S. government is currently in San Antonio, Texas, awaiting a specialized overhaul to potentially serve as the next Air Force One for President Trump.
