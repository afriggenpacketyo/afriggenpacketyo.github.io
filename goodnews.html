          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The emergency ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit by attorneys arguing the move would violate legal protections for vulnerable minors. The administration contended it was repatriating the children at their families' request, but the judge cited the government's hurried, overnight actions as justification for the extraordinary 14-day halt.</p>

          <p>Following a 2-1 defeat to Brighton, Manchester City is experiencing its worst start to a Premier League season since 2004-05, raising questions about their title contention. Despite significant spending and the return of key player Rodri from injury, the team has shown inconsistency and defensive vulnerabilities. Manager Pep Guardiola acknowledged the team "forgot to play" after conceding, but urged patience, stating the season is long. Historically, no team has recovered from such a poor start in a 38-game season to win the league title.</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has formally requested all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the Treasury Department. The request, made in a letter on Sunday, is part of the committee's investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking network. This action follows the committee's establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and its issuance of deposition subpoenas to high-profile former officials, signaling a continued push for transparency on the matter.</p>

This marks his second such achievement in less than a year, with his first happening at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father.

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that Europe is developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview with the Financial Times, she indicated these plans would be backed by U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems, following assurances from President Trump. The potential deployment could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops. High-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders in Paris, signaling a significant step in long-term security commitments for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates. The agreement is seen as a major victory for the UK's defense industry over international competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union foreign ministers convened for informal talks to brainstorm future strategies for supporting Ukraine, with several new ideas being considered. Proposals discussed included imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil to create a "safe haven" from Russian attacks. Additionally, there was renewed debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets, rather than just the interest, to fund Ukraine's reconstruction. Ministers also floated the idea of shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian soil in the event of a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital marine ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. A team led by the non-profit Bay Foundation has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens" by having divers manually smash more than 5.8 million purple sea urchins. These voracious herbivores had decimated the kelp forests, which are crucial habitats for hundreds of species. The removal of the urchins, whose populations exploded due to an imbalance in the ecosystem, has allowed the fast-growing "sequoias of the sea" to make a dramatic and rapid comeback.</p>

          <p>A significant discovery at the ancient archaeological site of Kultepe in Turkey has revealed a series of private homes, challenging previous assumptions about the settlement's layout. After 77 years of excavation at the site, archaeologists unearthed these more modest dwellings, which predate the arrival of Assyrian merchants. The finding suggests that Kultepe was a major center with a complex social structure long before it was previously understood, housing not just palatial residences but also the homes of administrators and craftsmen. Researchers believe further excavation will provide new insights into the daily lives of ancient Anatolians.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Arch Manning had a difficult debut as the full-time starter for No. 1 Texas, losing 14-7 to Ohio State in the season opener. Manning accepted responsibility for the loss, stating "I've got to play better for us to win," after completing 17 of 30 passes for 170 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Head coach Steve Sarkisian defended his young quarterback, criticizing the "out of control" external expectations placed upon him. Sarkisian urged patience, framing the loss as just the first chapter in a long season for both Manning and the Longhorns.</p>
