          <p>This article discusses the development of sexual orientation, explaining that it is diverse and not a choice but rather a matter of fate influenced by biological and psychosocial factors during puberty. Experts emphasize that sexual preference remains stable after adolescence, despite social pressures. The article highlights that same-sex orientation accounts for about 3-5% of the population across cultures and condemns discrimination based on sexual orientation. It also touches on the interplay of genetic makeup, hormones, and social influences in shaping sexuality, underscoring that no single factor determines a person's sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is a significant weakness. She believes the party needs younger leaders who are willing to challenge incumbents and push back against the Trump administration. Litman's organization recruits and trains progressives under 40 to run for office. She emphasizes the importance of open conversations about retirement for older leaders and suggests primaries are valuable for developing political skills, advocating for leaders who can effectively communicate the urgency of the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Video footage showing Brigitte Macron appearing to push French President Emmanuel Macron's face upon arrival in Hanoi has stirred speculation. Macron's office downplayed the incident as a harmless joke, initially denying the video's authenticity.

Manchester City had a disappointing season by their high standards, failing to win the Premier League and losing in the Champions League play-off stage. Chelsea, under Enzo Maresca, secured a Champions League spot and look forward to a Europa Conference League final, but need a better goalkeeper and reliable goalscorer for the future.</p>

          <p>British businesses are reportedly "rebranding" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid unwanted political scrutiny, according to senior figures. With right-wing attacks increasing, especially in the US, firms are reframing DEI policies as "wellbeing", "belonging", and "culture." Some US-headquartered firms have scaled back commitments and are less keen to publicly celebrate inclusion work. Despite these changes, experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks associated with discrimination cases.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives for officer mental health are gaining traction. Law enforcement agencies are creating wellness units and providing services to help officers cope with job-related stressors. The killing of George Floyd served as a catalyst, bringing the issue of police mental health to the forefront. There is an increased focus on education, peer support, and specialized treatment facilities to address the high rates of depression, burnout, and PTSD among officers. These efforts aim to reduce stigma and promote a culture of wellness within law enforcement.</p>
