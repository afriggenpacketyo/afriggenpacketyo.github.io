          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar to be used as Air Force One. The aircraft, valued at approximately $400 million, will be retrofitted for presidential use and later donated to Trump's presidential library foundation. This arrangement raises legal questions surrounding the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision comes amid delays and budget overruns in modernizing the existing Air Force One aircraft.</p>

          <p>Germany is increasingly concerned about societal polarization and how to deal with the far-right AfD party. The German domestic intelligence service classified the AfD as "confirmed right-wing extremist," but the party has challenged this in court. The debate centers on whether to ban the AfD, with opponents arguing it would further promote social division. Experts suggest journalists should adapt their reporting to clarify that the AfD is not a normal party.</p>
