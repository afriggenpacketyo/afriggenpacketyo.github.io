          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations after being bitten in waist-deep water at Jones Beach on Long Island, New York. While she did not see the creature, experts believe the bite was likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and authorities will maintain increased patrols throughout the summer. The event highlights the rarity of such encounters, with officials noting a global average of 64 unprovoked bites annually in recent years.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol investigated a driver's report of a baby tiger on the side of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. Upon arrival, the responding officer discovered the animal was actually a deceased hawk, not a large feline cub. The reason for the zoological mix-up remains unclear. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California for unlicensed individuals, a rule reinforced by the federal Big Cat Public Safety Act of 2022.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of protesters, led by students, gathered in Belgrade to demand early parliamentary elections and threaten civil disobedience if the government does not comply. The demonstrations are the latest in a series of months-long protests against populist President Aleksandar Vucic, originally sparked by a fatal rail station collapse blamed on corruption. Vucic has rejected calls for a snap election, blaming foreign influence for the unrest. The ongoing protests reflect growing public discontent and a determined youth-led movement pushing for political change in Serbia.</p>
