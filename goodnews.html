          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed employee discontent during an internal meeting, acknowledging that the company's leadership needs to "do better" to rebuild trust. His comments follow several rounds of layoffs and a new mandate requiring many employees to return to the office three days a week. While the company is performing exceptionally well financially, driven by its cloud and AI businesses, Nadella recognized the need to improve the social contract with employees, especially regarding mentorship and company culture in a hybrid work environment.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, head of the newly formed Paramount Skydance, is reportedly preparing a takeover offer for Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that sent WBD's stock soaring nearly 30%. A potential merger would create a media powerhouse, combining Paramount's franchises like "Star Trek" and "Mission Impossible" with WBD's vast library, which includes DC Comics, "Harry Potter," and "Game of Thrones." Such a deal would also consolidate significant sports media rights, creating a formidable competitor in the entertainment landscape.</p>

          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced an unusual situation at the BMW PGA Championship when his golf ball was apparently stolen by spectators after an errant tee shot. The incident happened just before play was suspended due to weather. Fitzpatrick later described the outcome as favorable, as the rules allowed him to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball. He believes this strange turn of events ultimately saved him at least one stroke in his round.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has completed a loan move to Trabzonspor for the rest of the 2025-26 season. The transfer to the Turkish club comes after Onana, a high-profile signing from Inter Milan in 2023 for £47.2 million, did not play in the team's first three Premier League matches of the season. His only appearance for the club this season was in a Carabao Cup defeat, signaling a shift in the team's goalkeeping preferences.</p>

          <p>The conviction of former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting to stage a coup represents a landmark moment for Brazil's young democracy. The widely followed trial revealed detailed evidence of a plot to undermine the 2022 election, including plans to assassinate his successor. While Bolsonaro's supporters decry the verdict as political persecution, critics view it as a crucial step in holding leaders accountable and establishing a precedent that attempts to subvert democratic institutions will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Average U.S. mortgage rates have fallen to 6.35% for a 30-year term, their lowest point in almost a year, creating a potential window of opportunity for buyers and homeowners. This decline is largely attributed to expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate and a corresponding drop in the 10-year Treasury yield. The more favorable borrowing climate encourages those in the market to evaluate their options, though there is no guarantee that rates will not rise again in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in Germany's education circles about reforming high school reading lists to better reflect the country's modern, diverse society. Critics of the current curriculum argue that its heavy focus on classic literature by authors like Goethe fails to engage students and lacks representation of women and people with immigrant backgrounds. While some advocate for including more contemporary works, others contend that the classics are vital for teaching critical thinking and understanding Germany's cultural history.</p>
