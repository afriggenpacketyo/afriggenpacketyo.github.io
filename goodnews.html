          <p>Science and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the need for police forces to embrace change and modernization in light of ongoing funding negotiations between the Home Office and the Treasury. Kyle highlighted that all sectors of society are facing financial pressures and that the government has already provided an additional ¬£1 billion to the police. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp voiced concerns about potential cuts to police numbers, while other political figures debated welfare reform and environmental spending. The negotiations will determine departmental spending for the next three to four years, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves warning that not all departments will receive their desired funding. </p>
