        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Singapore have achieved a significant milestone in creating remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, industrializing their production for potential use in disaster search missions. The team enhanced the robotic insect's turning ability to over 80 degrees, verifying this precise control through a series of experiments. This breakthrough, detailed in Nature Communications, is seen as meaningful work on insect-computer hybrid robots, promising to reduce mass production time and cost for practical applications. This development could pave the way for a miniature, deployable army of these bio-hybrid robots, offering unprecedented capabilities for navigating collapsed structures and locating survivors in hazardous environments where human entry is too risky, thereby revolutionizing emergency response.</p>

          <p>Korean Air has announced a substantial $36 billion deal to acquire 103 Boeing jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, aiming to significantly modernize its fleet ahead of its merger with Asiana Airlines. This major agreement was unveiled shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with President Trump, underscoring Trump's push for increased business with American firms amidst ongoing trade negotiations. Boeing stated the deal would support approximately 135,000 jobs across the U.S., providing a crucial boost to the aviation giant which has faced recent crises and production challenges. This marks a significant economic and strategic partnership between the two nations' industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns unexpectedly traded veteran quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, altering their roster plans. This move addresses the Raiders' urgent need for a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, providing them with a player who has 25 NFL starts. Pickett's own training camp was hampered by a hamstring injury, preventing him from competing effectively for a spot with the Browns. The trade leaves the backup position behind starter Joe Flacco wide open for rookies Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders, creating further roster speculation for Cleveland.</p>

          <p>Venus Williams' 25th US Open singles appearance concluded with a first-round loss to Czech 11th seed Karolína Muchová, despite the 45-year-old American staging a stirring second-set comeback. Muchová ultimately secured a 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 victory, progressing into the second round at Flushing Meadows. Williams, competing in her first Grand Slam in two years, received a warm ovation from the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd as she departed. Her exit leaves uncertainty about whether she will return as a player to the court where she previously won two of her seven major singles championships, marking a poignant moment for fans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in congressionally-allocated education funding, which had been abruptly frozen, following a multi-state lawsuit led by California and 22 other states. These vital funds, intended for after-school programs, teacher training, and support for English-learners, were initially withheld without clear explanation, though a White House spokesperson cited concerns about "grossly misused" money for a "radical left-wing agenda." States argued the impoundment was illegal under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. This reversal ensures critical programs, particularly benefiting low-income families, can continue despite the administration's ongoing efforts to reshape public education.</p>

New World Screwworm myiasis, caused by parasitic fly larvae, feeds on live tissue and can be deadly to animals, with no medication currently available for human treatment.
