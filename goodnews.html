          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a Maryland couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging the state's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on their journey ten years after the Supreme Court legalized it nationwide. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their public advocacy helped pave the way for Maryland to legalize marriage equality through legislation and a referendum in 2012. The couple expressed both pride in their role and concern over recent challenges to marriage rights, emphasizing the importance of continued vigilance to protect hard-won equality.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students at Johns Hopkins University has successfully designed and built a specialized printer to create braille labels for a local brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a device capable of embossing braille onto plastic beer labels. The student-designed machine features open hardware, allowing visually impaired employees to operate it easily, and has already produced 400 labels for a beer that supports a BISM fundraiser.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal or matrilineal society. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 individuals buried beneath the city's houses and discovered that while many occupants were unrelated, genetic connections were traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wives' households, and female offspring tended to remain. The findings, which also noted more grave goods for females, challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor lacerations to her leg and foot in what officials believe was likely a bite from a juvenile shark at Jones Beach, Long Island. The woman was in waist-deep water when the incident occurred and did not see what bit her. Experts who analyzed photos of the non-life-threatening injuries concluded they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, and authorities will continue enhanced patrols, though officials emphasize that such encounters remain rare.</p>

The event was outlawed under a new law that restricts gatherings promoting homosexuality to minors, but organizers proceeded with support from the city's mayor. The massive turnout, which included European officials, was seen not only as a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also as a broader protest against what many see as an erosion of democratic freedoms in Hungary.</p>
