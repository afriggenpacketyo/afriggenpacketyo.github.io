          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his college class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The palladium ring was discovered this summer by an electrician using a metal detector at Cedar Beach, New York. Instead of selling it for its scrap value, the finder used the engravings to track down the original owner, Al DiStefano, now 77. With the help of a fellow Fordham University alumna, the ring was successfully returned, serving as a heartwarming story of honesty and connection across decades.</p>

Longtime cast member Heidi Gardner is leaving after eight seasons, along with Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim. Additionally, writer Celeste Yim is also exiting the show.

          <p>Shares of buy-now, pay-later company Affirm surged over 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, and offered optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted strong consumer transaction frequency and growth, driven by key partnerships with Shopify and Amazon, which offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client. The company's Affirm Card also showed substantial growth, indicating traction in its strategy to expand usage at the point of sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a strong month of August on a weaker note, with the S&P 500 retreating from a record high and ending its four-week winning streak. Despite the weekly dip, the index gained roughly 2% for the month, marking its fourth consecutive monthly advance. The market's performance was influenced by Nvidia's strong but heavily scrutinized earnings report and new inflation data from the PCE price index, which showed core inflation at its highest annual rate since February. Investors remain focused on the Federal Reserve's next meeting, with widespread expectations for an interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have identified one of the strangest dinosaurs ever found, a 165-million-year-old species named Spicomellus, which was covered in bony spikes fused directly to its ribs. This newly discovered creature is the world's oldest known ankylosaur, a group of herbivorous dinosaurs famous for their tank-like armor. The unique fossil findings from Morocco challenge previous theories about ankylosaur evolution, which suggested their armor developed gradually over time. Researchers described the dinosaur as a "punk rocker" of its era, featuring an elaborate armory unlike any other known vertebrate, living or extinct.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive reelection victory four years after he says White officials locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. In the town's first election in at least six decades, held under a federal settlement, Braxton secured 66 votes to his opponent's 26. The election follows a lawsuit filed by Black residents challenging the town's history of "hand-me-down governance," where mayors appointed their successors without a vote. This practice had resulted in a predominantly White government in a majority-Black town for decades.</p>

          <p>After a decade away from releasing new parody songs, "Weird Al" Yankovic is back with a large-scale tour, embracing the elaborate productions that made him famous. Yankovic explains that he stepped back from parodies partly because the decline of a musical monoculture made hit songs less obvious targets, and he wanted to prove his artistic range with original comedic pastiches. Having successfully toured with a more stripped-down, originals-focused show, he is now returning to his classic format with more band members, costumes, and video screens. The new "Bigger & Weirder" tour features his iconic parodies spanning decades of pop music.</p>

They announced progress on joint defense projects and a resolution to their dispute over nuclear energy policy. Despite the warm display of unity, fundamental differences in national interests and a looming political crisis for Macron in Paris cast uncertainty over the long-term impact of the agreements.</p>

He contrasts his son's modern classroom with his own first day of school in a dirt-floor "church school" in rural Uganda, highlighting the vast difference in opportunities. The author reflects on his journey to the U.S., the generosity of the American family who adopted him, and the profound gratitude he feels for being able to provide his son with an education he once only dreamed of.

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates remaining high, seniors have several alternative options to tap into their record-high home equity without altering their existing low-rate mortgages. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, which converts equity into payments for the senior and only requires repayment upon death or sale of the home. Other viable methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that have recently declined, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide flexible borrowing with initial interest-only payments, though they typically have variable rates.

          <p>High-end ranch brokers are seeing a trend of multigenerational "trophy" ranches hitting the market as heirs increasingly choose to sell rather than manage the vast properties. Disagreements among scattered family members, lack of interest from younger generations, and the financial complexities of maintaining the properties are driving the sales. These legacy ranches are in high demand from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy, open space, and a connection to the American West. This generational transfer of wealth is making once-in-a-lifetime properties available for the first time in decades.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by attempting to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics. The ruling provides temporary relief for Venezuelans who fled their country's political and economic crisis and were granted permission to live and work in the United States.</p>
