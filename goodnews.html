          <p>Colorado football head coach Deion Sanders has publicly spoken about his physical condition after undergoing surgery for bladder cancer. He stated that he feels healthy and vibrant, and has resumed walking a mile daily around campus. Sanders had his bladder removed after a high-risk, non-invasive tumor was discovered during the offseason. He and his doctors confirmed he is now cured, and he used the opportunity to urge men to get regular health check-ups, emphasizing that early detection was critical in his own case.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to potentially redefine qualified assets for 401(k) retirement plans. This change could allow for investments in alternative assets like private equity and cryptocurrencies, which are typically higher-risk and less transparent than traditional stocks and bonds. Proponents argue it democratizes retirement savings and offers potential for higher returns, but financial experts caution about increased volatility, higher fees, and the complexity of these investments for average savers. The implementation timeline remains unclear, with adoption expected to be slow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a landmark peace deal at the White House, formally ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Hosted by President Trump, the agreement establishes diplomatic relations and mutual respect for territorial integrity. A key component of the deal is the creation of a U.S.-developed trade and transit corridor, named after Trump, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. Both Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised Trump's role as a peacemaker and announced they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide the crippled spacecraft and its crew safely back to Earth in 1970, turning a potential tragedy into a 'successful failure.' He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, from which the iconic 'Earthrise' photograph was taken. NASA and his family remembered him as a hero whose courage and character inspired millions.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as 'illegal migrants' in a social media post. He had alerted authorities and demanded mass deportations before the crew's identity was confirmed by the HM Coastguard. The rowers, who are raising money for motor neurone disease and include a former Royal Marine, found the incident 'hilarious.' In a subsequent post, Lowe acknowledged the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity, while reiterating his stance on immigration.</p>

Her statement comes in response to reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to develop plans for action against Latin American cartels. Sheinbaum emphasized that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on security issues, any foreign military presence is 'absolutely rejected' to protect national sovereignty. The discussion has revived historical fears in Mexico of U.S. intervention, though it remains unclear which countries might be targeted in any potential U.S. operation.</p>

          <p>A new report from Realtor.com indicates that home prices are beginning to fall in certain U.S. regions, particularly in the South and West. Cities like Austin and Miami have seen the most significant declines from their 2022 peaks, driven by rising housing inventory from a pandemic-era building boom and homes staying on the market longer. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight inventory and rising prices due to fewer new constructions. The data suggests a rebalancing of the national housing market, with distinct regional trends emerging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares for rare earth miner MP Materials rose after the company reported narrower second-quarter losses and record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, robotics, and electronics. The improved financial results follow a major investment from the Department of Defense, which purchased $400 million in stock and set a price floor for NdPr. The company is now focused on scaling up magnet production at its new facility in Texas to supply General Motors and other manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Mining Industry Sees Bipartisan Support to Boost Domestic Supply Chains</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 16:20:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is leveraging bipartisan federal support, including from the Defense Production Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, to bolster its domestic mining and refining capabilities. One such project is a new nickel processing plant in North Dakota, supported by a $114 million grant, which will process ore for electric vehicle batteries and other strategic uses. This initiative reflects a multi-administration effort to reduce reliance on foreign nations like China, which controls a majority of the world's critical minerals. The goal is to secure domestic supply chains for both clean energy and national defense.</p>
