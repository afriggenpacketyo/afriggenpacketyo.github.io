          <p>Japan's only seal sanctuary, the Okhotsk Tokkari Center, rescues and rehabilitates injured seals with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. Staff members intentionally avoid naming or having direct contact with the seals to prevent emotional attachment, which could make it harder to return them to their natural habitat. Despite these efforts, staff members often develop affectionate bonds with the animals. The center rescues seals found along the Sea of Okhotsk coast and has helped more than 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s.</p>
