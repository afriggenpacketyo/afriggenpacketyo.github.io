          <p>Amazon has announced it will be shutting down its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The content from Freevee will be consolidated into the main Prime Video platform, where it will remain available to watch for free with ads, even for users without a Prime subscription. This move follows the recent introduction of an ad-supported tier to Prime Video and is part of Amazon's strategy to simplify its video offerings and create a more unified viewing experience for its customers.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Tour de France is set to begin on July 5, featuring a challenging route with six mountain stages and a total elevation gain of 52,500 meters. Defending champion Tadej Pogacar is considered the top favorite, with past winners Jonas Vingegaard and Remco Evenepoel also expected to be strong contenders for the overall victory. The article also highlights other riders to watch, such as sprinter Biniam Girmay, and discusses ongoing issues within the sport, including rider safety at high speeds and the persistent, though diminished, specter of doping.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Costs Decline Amid Political Reassurances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 06:39:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of UK government borrowing fell, partially reversing a spike from the previous day, after Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly backed Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The yield on 10-year bonds had risen amid market fears that the chancellor might resign after a major U-turn on welfare reforms left a hole in her fiscal plans. Analysts suggest the market's negative reaction to a potential departure indicates support for Reeves's commitment to fiscal discipline, and the Prime Minister's reassurance helped calm investor nerves, though some volatility is expected to remain.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant decision, the Wisconsin State Supreme Court has ruled that a 175-year-old state law from 1849 does not prohibit consensual abortions. The ruling clarifies the legal landscape for abortion access in the state, which had been uncertain since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The court's interpretation means that the pre-Civil War era statute, which was originally understood to target feticide, cannot be used to enforce a near-total ban on abortion procedures, thereby keeping access legally protected in Wisconsin for the time being.</p>

          <p>Arsenal Football Club is actively seeking to bolster its attacking lineup this summer, with a primary focus on acquiring a new centre-forward and potentially two attacking midfielders. The club is reportedly pursuing strikers like Viktor Gyokeres and Benjamin Sesko, with a deal for either likely to cost over ¬£70 million. The outcome of the striker search will influence their ability to target creative players such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo or Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. The article suggests this offensive refresh could also lead to the departure of an established player.</p>

While affirming the country's 'firm' alliance with the United States, Lee emphasized that peace is a minimum prerequisite for stability and that his government will work to better its relationships with its powerful neighbors. This move comes as China has reportedly invited President Lee to a major military parade in Beijing, signaling potential for a diplomatic thaw.</p>
