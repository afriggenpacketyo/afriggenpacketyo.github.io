          <p>The U.S. Army is set to resume horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery in June after a suspension due to horse deaths and injuries in 2023. An investigation revealed that horses were overworked and pulling excessively heavy wagons. Equestrian experts were brought in to improve horse welfare, reduce workload, and lighten the caissons. New training programs have been implemented for unit personnel, with a focus on animal care and well-being, and two squads of 11 horses will now perform a maximum of two services a day.</p>

          <p>Bridget Brink, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, is contemplating a run for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district. Brink resigned from her post as envoy to Ukraine in April, citing policy differences with the Trump administration regarding the approach to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. She expressed disagreement with putting pressure on Ukraine, viewing it as appeasement rather than a path to lasting peace. Brink's decision to consider a congressional bid reflects her continued commitment to public service and her desire to influence policy from within the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have surged to record highs, with ground beef reaching $5.80 per pound in April, a nearly 50% increase from five years ago. Ranchers attribute the price hikes to rising costs for feed, land, and financing, as well as drought conditions that have reduced cattle herds to their lowest numbers in over 70 years. The USDA forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025, as ranchers struggle to maintain profitability amid tightening supplies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in more than two years. The increase was partly driven by surging rice prices, as the Bank of Japan considers pausing its rate hike policy to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The Bank of Japan Governor has signaled a willingness to raise rates based on price trends but also noted the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs.</p>
