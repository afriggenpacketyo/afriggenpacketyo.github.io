          <p>British band Wolf Alice has earned a historic fourth consecutive Mercury Prize nomination for their album, "The Clearing," an unprecedented achievement among their peers. While singer Ellie Rowsell expresses anxiety about awards, the band maintains a strong conviction that a well-crafted album is among the highest forms of art, a philosophy that underpins their musical approach. This article delves into their evolving sound, which has shifted from alt-rock to incorporate nostalgic 1970s FM pop influences, and their process of embracing a bolder, more confident musical identity.

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has formally rejected a Trump administration proposal that sought to tie federal funding to adherence to specific policies, asserting that the compact would "restrict freedom of expression" and conflict with the university's fundamental principles. The "Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education" included provisions like capping international student admissions, limiting university leaders' political commentary, and adopting a binary gender definition. MIT President Sally Kornbluth emphasized that scientific funding should be based solely on merit and that the university's values are chosen freely. This article illustrates a significant clash over academic independence and governmental influence on higher education.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a 45-year-old now living in the UK, shares his compelling story of being radicalized as a teenager in the 1990s, where he was willing to die for the Taliban. Having fled the Afghan civil war, he was exposed to intense religious propaganda in a Pakistani refugee camp, where mullahs promised glory and an alluring afterlife for martyrs. This article details his gradual process of deradicalization, prompted by witnessing the Taliban's cruelty and questioning their interpretation of Islam. Banayee has since authored "Delusions of Paradise," aiming to educate and prevent other vulnerable young people from succumbing to extremism.</p>

          <p>Many individuals experience a noticeable shift in mood during autumn and winter, commonly referred to as "autumn blues" or, in more severe cases, Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This article explores diverse strategies for managing these seasonal mood changes, which are often linked to decreased sunlight affecting serotonin and melatonin levels. It highlights approaches like actively maintaining a social calendar, seeking natural light exposure, and utilizing light therapy devices. Conversely, some embrace the season by "romanticizing" colder months with cozy indoor activities like hot baths and candles. Experts emphasize the importance of diet, exercise, and consistent sleep patterns to regulate circadian rhythms and improve overall well-being.</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team, the Academy of Classical Christian Studies, demonstrated exceptional sportsmanship by voluntarily returning its division championship trophy. Coach Brendan King, upon reviewing game footage, realized his team had actually lost the title game by one point, despite a buzzer-beater initially securing their perceived victory. Although league rules prevented changing the official score, King consulted his team, who unanimously agreed that keeping the trophy would be unethical. The team's unprecedented appeal led the league to award the championship to Apache High, an act praised by the opposing coach as a testament to good character and hope.</p>
