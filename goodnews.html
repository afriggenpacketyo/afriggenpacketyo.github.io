          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move could force conspiracy theorist Alex Jones off the air and lead to the sale of the Infowars brand and property. The families' lawyers expressed satisfaction, viewing this as a final step toward accountability for Jones's harassment. The decision shifts the process out of federal bankruptcy court, where a potential sale to the satirical site The Onion was previously halted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new large-scale study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatments for ADHD can provide wider life benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. Researchers in Sweden found that taking ADHD medication was associated with significant reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The findings are based on a study of nearly 150,000 people and provide new evidence on the potential long-term benefits of treatment. Experts say this information could help patients make more informed decisions about starting medication for the disorder.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. efforts to curb China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asia to bolster their competitiveness. This strategic shift aims to address domestic constraints like labor shortages and high costs. As a prime example, HD Hyundai is investing $550 million to revive a defunct shipyard in the Philippines, with plans to build up to ten vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. Analysts note that while this move is a viable long-term solution, it will take time to develop the necessary technical skills in the new locations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a late collapse that saw them lose the Super Cup to Paris St-Germain on penalties after leading 2-0, Tottenham Hotspur showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For most of the match, the team displayed a pragmatic and effective 3-5-2 formation, a significant departure from the high-risk style of the previous manager. Both of Tottenham's goals came from set-pieces, a known strength of Frank's former teams, indicating a new focus on tactical discipline. While the final result was disappointing, the performance suggested a solid foundation for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the shift in public trust from traditional institutions to individual online creators, noting the challenges this presents for credible information. While social media can amplify misinformation, a growing cohort of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts—are working to provide factual content. The author argues that this new media ecosystem is in an "awkward adolescence" and needs new infrastructure, such as independent certification systems and collaborative frameworks for creators. This would help audiences identify trustworthy sources and allow credible voices to compete in the attention economy.</p>

          <p>Brinker International CEO Kevin Hochman stated that a significant increase in marketing spending has been a key driver of growth for the Chili's restaurant chain. The company's marketing budget grew from $32 million to $137 million over three years, which has fueled a 23.7% increase in same-store sales. Hochman highlighted the success of using social media influencers and standardizing a $10.99 value meal nationwide as effective strategies. He explained that this growth helps the company offset inflationary pressures on labor and goods by creating leverage on fixed costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Google awaits a judge's remedy decision in its landmark antitrust case, AI company Perplexity has made a public bid of $34.5 billion to acquire the Chrome browser. This move comes after the Department of Justice recommended that Google be forced to divest Chrome to level the playing field for search competitors. The article details the high stakes for Google's parent company, Alphabet, which faces a potential breakup of its core businesses. Analysts have placed varying valuations on Alphabet's assets, including Chrome, YouTube, and its cloud division, in anticipation of the ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cisco reported quarterly earnings and revenue that slightly surpassed analyst expectations, and it issued an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. The networking giant has been actively investing in artificial intelligence, with CEO Chuck Robbins noting that AI infrastructure orders from web companies exceeded $2 billion in the last fiscal year, doubling the company's goal. The company's networking revenue grew 12% year-over-year, although security revenue fell short of estimates. Despite what it calls a complex environment, Cisco's performance has contributed to a 19% rise in its stock price this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of a planned meeting in Alaska between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, NPR revisited the history of the territory's sale from Russia to the United States in 1867. The report details the circumstances of the purchase, famously known as "Seward's Folly," which was initially criticized in the U.S. but later proved to be a strategic acquisition. The article also notes that even today, some in Russia question the legitimacy of the sale and still view Alaska as historically Russian territory, adding a layer of historical context to the upcoming high-stakes diplomatic meeting.</p>

          <p>Record-level flooding from a glacial lake outburst was largely contained in Juneau, Alaska, thanks to newly installed temporary barriers along the Mendenhall River. The flood, caused by a release from the ice-dammed Suicide Basin, crested at a new record height but did not cause the widespread home damage seen in previous years. Officials credited the 10,000 reinforced sandbag-style barriers with protecting hundreds of properties. These annual floods have intensified due to climate change, which is causing the Mendenhall Glacier to recede and altering the stability of the natural ice dam.</p>

This move comes as the U.S. increases pressure on Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking and fentanyl production.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams are now valued at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable franchise in the NFL, according to new rankings from Sportico. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team was last in the league with a valuation under $1 billion while in St. Louis. The surge in value is largely attributed to owner Stan Kroenke's vision and development of SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, which has become a global hub for sports and entertainment. The valuation reflects the team's success in monetizing the new venue and building a strong corporate and fan base in Los Angeles. (not investment advice)</p>

Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for the crime, had filed petitions to introduce a new statement from a security guard and challenge the fact his driver did not testify. The court's denial marks another legal setback for the artist, whose previous motion for a new trial was also rejected last year. His main appeal is scheduled for oral argument on August 18th.</p>
