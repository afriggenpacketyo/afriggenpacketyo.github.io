          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior members of its R&D team. This move is part of an ongoing "talent war" among major tech companies seeking to dominate the artificial intelligence space. While Google is not investing in Windsurf, it will gain a nonexclusive license to some of its technology, which is popular for "vibe coding." This type of talent acquisition, where key personnel are hired without a full company purchase, has also been used by Microsoft and Amazon to bolster their AI capabilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that New York City Mayor Eric Adams's policy banning face masks in certain public areas is a constitutional and sensible public safety measure. The author contends that the ban is not about suppressing speech but about preventing individuals from using anonymity to commit crimes, such as antisemitic vandalism or flash mob robberies. Citing legal precedent, the article asserts there is no constitutional right to conceal one's identity during public demonstrations. The measure is framed as a responsible effort to balance liberty with security, ensuring public protest remains public and accountable.</p>

          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace has officially filed for an initial public offering, with plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "FLY." The Texas-based company, known for its Alpha rockets and the Blue Ghost lunar lander, is going public amidst a resurgence in the IPO market. The filing reveals significant revenue growth, with revenue increasing more than sixfold to nearly $56 million year-over-year, although net losses also widened. The company reports a substantial backlog of approximately $1.1 billion, indicating strong future demand for its space transportation services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has confirmed that the United States has resumed sending military supplies, after a temporary halt on critical arms shipments last week. The renewal of aid, including Patriot air defense systems, comes after a surge in Russian drone and missile attacks that have caused record civilian casualties. The new arrangement involves NATO purchasing Patriot systems from the U.S. and then distributing them to Ukraine, with some European allies helping to fund the costs. This development occurs as the U.S. administration expresses growing frustration over the lack of progress toward a negotiated peace.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. Macias, the leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a high-profile prison escape that triggered a wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His agreement in court marks a significant step, making him the first Ecuadorian to be extradited under a new law approved by referendum. The move is seen as a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's government in its war against the country's powerful criminal gangs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by testing the integration of uncrewed XQ-58A Valkyrie drones with crewed fighter jets. In a recent exercise, pilots in F-16 and F-15 fighters each controlled two of the semi-autonomous drones, testing their coordination in a simulated combat environment. This "loyal wingman" concept, where uncrewed aircraft are directed by human pilots, is a key focus for the U.S. Air Force as it competes with China for future air supremacy. The tests represent a significant step in the race to deploy collaborative crewed and uncrewed aerial combat teams.</p>

          <p>South Carolina is set to honor Robert Smalls, an enslaved man who became a Civil War hero and U.S. congressman, with a statue on its Capitol grounds. This will be the first monument dedicated to a Black man at the state's Capitol, a site that currently features statues of white men, many with ties to the Confederacy and Jim Crow era. Smalls famously commandeered a Confederate transport ship in 1862, sailing it past Confederate defenses to freedom and delivering it to the Union Navy. The move to erect the statue represents a significant historical and cultural milestone for the state.</p>

According to a study by Match.com, one in four singles now use AI for dating help, a significant increase from the previous year. While some users find it boosts their confidence, the trend raises questions about authenticity in a technologically mediated search for human connection.</p>

As a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, he admitted to overseeing a massive fentanyl trafficking operation that supplied the U.S. with vast quantities of the opioid. As part of his plea deal, Guzman Lopez must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could involve testifying against other cartel members, including his own family.

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, a remarkable achievement for a player who took an indefinite break from the sport in 2023. Citing burnout and mental health struggles, the former teen prodigy stepped away from the tour to prioritize her well-being, a move some warned could end her career at the top level. Her run to the final, which included a semifinal victory over the world's top-ranked player, marks a powerful comeback.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged past $118,000 to a new all-time high, liquidating $2.42 billion in short positions in the process. Despite the record price, market analysis suggests that the bull run is not being driven by the same speculative mania seen in previous cycles. Key indicators, such as Glassnode's NUPL ratio, remain below the "euphoria" zone, and exchange inflow data from CryptoQuant shows that selling pressure from long-term holders and large "whale" investors remains unusually low. This suggests the current rally is supported by more consistent, long-term buying rather than short-term speculative overheating. (not investment advice)</p>
