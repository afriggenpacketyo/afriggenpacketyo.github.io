        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is significantly increasing the size of its secondary share sale, allowing current and former employees to sell up to $10.3 billion in stock. This is a substantial increase from the initial target of $6 billion and values the company at $500 billion, a notable rise from its earlier $300 billion valuation. The offering, which includes investors like SoftBank and Thrive Capital, provides liquidity for staff and alleviates pressure for an initial public offering. Such sales are a common strategy among high-value private tech companies to allow early employees to realize financial gains from their equity.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing from degraded hair samples, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This landmark decision sets a new precedent for forensic science in New York State courts, allowing prosecutors to link Heuermann and his family to hair found on several victims. The defense has challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but prosecutors hailed it as a major victory based on reliable science. The technology allows for identification from old or rootless hair by analyzing thousands of DNA variations.</p>

          <p>A new, 70-minute adaptation of "The Wizard of Oz" at the Las Vegas Sphere offers a technologically advanced and immersive viewing experience, though it feels more like a theme park ride than a traditional film. The presentation utilizes the venue's massive 16K LED screens, vibrating seats, and environmental effects like wind and scented foam to augment the classic movie. While visually stunning, especially during the tornado scene, the review notes that the high-definition and digitally expanded visuals can sometimes detract from the original's charm and emotional depth. The high ticket price and debate over AI in such productions remain points of discussion.</p>

          <p>A new report from a Washington-based think tank advises the U.S. government to tone down its rhetoric and reduce defense investments that are based on the premise of an imminent Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors argue that strategic, political, and military factors make such an invasion unlikely and that the current "threat inflation" in Washington is counterproductive. This counsel comes as the U.S. Congress is finalizing its annual defense bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China. The report challenges the prevailing narrative, including statements from defense officials that China's military is preparing for a potential invasion by 2027.</p>

          <p>The online prediction betting platform Polymarket is set to launch in the United States after receiving clearance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The company's CEO, Shayne Coplan, announced that the regulator had given the platform the "green light" to go live. This development follows a CFTC decision to take a "no-action position" on certain data reporting regulations for event contracts, which effectively removes a key barrier to the site's U.S. operations. The clearance comes after both the CFTC and the Department of Justice concluded their investigations into the company in July without filing any charges.</p>

          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, a new wave of AI-powered tools is emerging to help consumers negotiate with creditors. These platforms promise to automate the debt settlement process, often at a lower cost than traditional debt relief companies, by analyzing finances and communicating with lenders to reduce balances. However, the article advises caution, noting potential downsides such as limited flexibility in complex cases, the risk of scams, and a lack of consumer protection regulations. For those with significant debt, the human expertise and legal safeguards of a reputable debt relief company may be a more reliable option.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued an injunction blocking the Trump administration from using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan nationals. The 2-1 decision from the Fifth Circuit rejected the administration's claim that a Venezuelan gang's presence constituted an "invasion or predatory incursion," a prerequisite for invoking the wartime statute. Legal advocates and Democrats hailed the ruling as a crucial victory for the rule of law, reining in what they see as executive overreach. The law has only been used three times previously, all during declared wars, and this ruling marks a significant check on the president's attempts to expand his authority.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is a better option for a $25,000 deposit in the current interest rate environment. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher rates for most short-term scenarios, their variable rates are expected to fall following anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed rate, guaranteeing the return over the term and protecting savers from declining rates. The piece concludes that for those who have saved a significant sum, the security of a fixed-rate CD may be the more prudent choice. (not investment advice)</p>

His nomination comes amid concerns that the president seeks to exert more influence over the Fed to push for lower interest rates. While vowing to preserve the Fed's independence, Miran also raised questions about oversight of the bank's activities outside its core mandates.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, long-term studies of its survivors have revealed a surprising psychological outcome known as post-traumatic growth. While many experienced significant and lasting trauma, including PTSD and depression, a large percentage also reported positive personal changes, such as feeling stronger and having a greater appreciation for life. Researchers found that this growth often coexists with post-traumatic stress. Key factors that fostered this resilience include strong social support networks and a high sense of self-efficacy, offering important lessons for helping communities recover from future climate-related disasters.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 on September 17, mortgage rates may begin to fall even before the official decision. Mortgage lenders often act in anticipation of the Fed's moves, meaning they could lower their rates as a cut becomes more certain. This pattern was observed last year when rates dropped just before a Fed reduction was announced. While the Fed's policy is a major influence, other factors like the 10-year Treasury yield also impact mortgage rates, which have already been on a gradual decline for much of the year.

The weaker jobs data suggests a potential cooling of the labor market, which can ease inflation concerns and lead investors to buy government bonds, pushing their yields down.
