          <p>General Motors announced it will expand its production of gasoline-powered vehicles, shifting manufacturing of the Cadillac Escalade SUV to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. The facility will also add production of the popular Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to meet sustained high customer demand. This decision represents a significant investment in traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, even as the Orion plant was previously slated to become GM's second exclusive electric vehicle factory in the U.S. The move highlights the company's strategy to balance EV development with profitable legacy products.</p>

          <p>In a notable collaboration between rivals, Amazon is using Elon Musk's SpaceX to launch its next group of Kuiper internet satellites. This move highlights Amazon's urgent need for launch capacity to meet a 2026 FCC deadline for its satellite constellation, which aims to compete with SpaceX's dominant Starlink service. The partnership underscores the intense competition and massive investment in the satellite internet market, a new frontier for the rivalry between billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. Amazon has committed over $10 billion to Project Kuiper, chasing a market projected to be worth over $40 billion by 2030.</p>

          <h2>AMD and Nvidia to Resume AI Chip Shipments to China After US Policy Shift</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:06:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AMD announced it will soon restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, following a U.S. Commerce Department decision to resume reviewing export license applications. Competitor Nvidia also stated it plans to resume sales of its China-specific H20 chips, a move that comes after CEO Jensen Huang met with President Trump. This policy reversal signals a significant shift from the Trump administration's earlier crackdown on AI chip exports to China, which had been implemented over national security concerns. The news caused a surge in AMD's stock, as chipmakers had previously warned of substantial revenue losses due to the restrictions.</p>

This initiative is part of a broader effort to channel some of the £300 billion held in cash savings accounts into UK companies, aiming to stimulate the nation's economy.</p>

          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to source rare earth magnets, a critical component in electronics, from a facility in Texas.

This partnership is a significant step in reducing American reliance on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth market.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining the best age to purchase an annuity depends heavily on an individual's specific financial goals, health, and risk tolerance, rather than a universal rule. Generally, financial advisors suggest the window between ages 60 and 70 as a balanced time, as it can secure significant payouts while mitigating market risk near retirement. However, buying a deferred annuity earlier, such as in one's 50s, allows more time for tax-deferred growth. Conversely, waiting until the late 60s or early 70s for an immediate annuity typically yields the highest monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy calculations. (not investment advice)</p>
