          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a fresh record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., despite a broader downturn in other Asian markets. The Kospi's strong performance bucked regional trends, as fears intensified regarding the banking sector and trade tensions elsewhere. While the Kospi surged, the Kosdaq saw earlier gains recede, and other major Asia-Pacific indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei experienced losses. This divergence highlights specific investor confidence in South Korea's economic outlook tied to trade developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military can now apply for a digital version of their identity cards, a move praised by ministers as a "case study" for a planned nationwide digital ID scheme. This optional digital card allows 1.8 million eligible veterans easier access to public services like healthcare, housing support, and discounts, complementing existing physical cards. The government emphasizes its role in addressing privacy and security concerns for the broader scheme, which is set to become mandatory for work by 2029. This initiative aims to modernize public services and streamline access for veterans.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Max Scherzer delivered a vintage performance, and Andrés Giménez contributed significantly with a home run and four RBIs, leading the Toronto Blue Jays to an 8-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners. This win evens the American League Championship Series at two games apiece, with the Blue Jays demonstrating strong offensive power in Seattle. Scherzer, at 41, became the oldest pitcher to start a postseason game since 2008, allowing just two runs over nearly six innings. The series now heads to Game 5, with momentum shifting after Toronto's back-to-back wins.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone Air quickly sold out in China within minutes of its launch, both in physical stores and online, indicating robust demand despite intense competition from local brands. This strong reception follows CEO Tim Cook's recent visit to the country, highlighting the device's popularity among Chinese consumers. The rapid sell-out and delayed online shipments underscore Apple's continued success in a challenging economic environment, where domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi are actively expanding into the high-end market. The article reflects a positive market response to the innovative, thinnest iPhone model.</p>

          <p>The article explores how public discourse around bodily functions, particularly sweating, has become less taboo, exemplified by celebrity openness like Alan Carr's admission on "The Traitors." This cultural shift is attributed to increased celebrity transparency, the rise of "sweat-positive" marketing in the beauty and fitness industries, and the growing popularity of activities like saunas for networking. While some experts are skeptical of commercial exploitation, the trend reflects a broader move towards body positivity and a more liberated view of natural human processes.

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court order, thereby blocking the president from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. The court also determined there was insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" or significant impediment to federal law enforcement, rejecting the administration's claims that troops were needed for crime prevention or protecting immigration facilities. This decision maintains state control over Guard troops despite federal objections.</p>
