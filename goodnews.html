        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts due to strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary tariff reprieve with the United States. While exports to the U.S. declined, the rate of decrease slowed, and shipments to Southeast Asia and the European Union saw significant increases. Imports also saw their first growth of the year, rising 1.1%, though economists remain cautious about the second half of 2025, citing uncertainty over U.S. tariff policies and the potential for fading export momentum.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's leadership is signaling a new policy direction by addressing "neijuan," a term for excessive internal competition that leads to diminishing returns. In a recent meeting, President Xi Jinping called for regulating disorderly, low-price competition and promoting the exit of outdated production capacity. Analysts note this new push differs from the 2015 supply-side reforms, as the current economic landscape involves more private firms, weaker growth, and limited government fiscal space, making the challenge more complex.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged past the $120,000 mark, setting a new record high driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is supported by increasing institutional buying and anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for the digital asset industry, with Congress set to deliberate on several crypto-related bills. Analysts suggest that institutional confidence and long-term holders are key drivers, projecting further appreciation despite potential risks from macroeconomic factors like trade disputes and Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has downplayed U.S. concerns that China's military could leverage his company's advanced chips, stating they cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In an interview ahead of his second trip to China this year, Huang reiterated that U.S. export controls have been counterproductive, arguing that American tech needs to be available globally to remain the standard. He is navigating a difficult path between Washington's security policies, which have cost Nvidia market share, and the large market of AI developers in China.</p>

This growth presents a significant challenge to established players like Tesla, as Norwegian consumers increasingly view Chinese EVs as high-quality, technologically advanced options, solidifying Norway's role as Europe's EV laboratory.</p>

          <p>To address soaring energy consumption, the Indian government has proposed a rule requiring new air conditioners to have a default minimum temperature setting of 20 degrees Celsius (68°F). With 10 to 15 million AC units sold annually, officials hope this measure will yield massive energy savings, as each degree increase can reduce consumption by about 6%.
