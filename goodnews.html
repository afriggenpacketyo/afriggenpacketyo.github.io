          <p>Senators from both parties are questioning the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding for PBS, NPR, and some foreign aid programs. Republicans such as Susan Collins acknowledged concerns about NPR's partisan slant but suggested more targeted approaches than eliminating all funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). The White House defends the cuts by stating that the targeted foreign aid programs are against American interests and that CPB is politically biased and an unnecessary expense. Democrats, including Sen. Patty Murray, questioned the legality of the White House's request, arguing that the cuts would harm rural communities and children. </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is being viewed by some Democrats as a sign of hope for the party, offering a potential path forward after recent defeats. Mamdani, a relatively unknown state assemblyman, ran an energetic campaign embracing progressive ideas, defeating former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Republicans are eager to portray Mamdani's policies as evidence of the Democratic Party's leftward shift. While the race was influenced by unique local factors, including Cuomo's scandals and Eric Adams' independent run, Mamdani's win highlights the importance of economic issues and engaging with new voters. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This decision marks a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional home lending. The directive requires Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals that include digital assets, without mandating borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this move aligns with President Trump's vision of making the United States the crypto capital of the world. Previously, cryptocurrency was excluded due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty. </p>

          <p>As NATO wraps up its meeting, Germany is planning to significantly expand its military, aiming to possess the largest army in the European Union.

This comes as most NATO members are also pledging to increase their defense spending.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states that sued to challenge the ongoing freeze. Congress had allocated billions of dollars for states to install high-speed chargers along highway corridors. The Department of Transportation announced a temporary pause in distributing these funds in February, but the judge has issued a preliminary injunction to halt the withholding of funds. The Department of Transportation has stated that the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster and failed to deliver EV chargers. The judge added a seven-day pause before the order goes into effect, allowing the administration time to appeal the decision. </p>

          <p>Louisiana offered significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption, to attract Meta's $10 billion data center. The data center, set to be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, will create only 500 permanent jobs but is expected to transform Louisiana's economy. The Meta site will use roughly twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day, requiring Entergy to build three gas-fired power plants at a cost of more than $3 billion. The state's efforts highlight the competition among states to attract data centers, despite their limited job creation and high resource consumption. </p>
