          <p>A highly anticipated boxing rematch between British rivals Chris Eubank Jr. and Conor Benn has been scheduled for November 15 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The announcement follows their thrilling middleweight bout in April, where Eubank Jr. secured a unanimous decision victory. The original rematch date in September was postponed due to concerns about Eubank's readiness. Promoters have now confirmed the new date, reigniting interest in the rivalry that follows in the footsteps of their famous fathers.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk announced a 67% surge in second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, though the figure slightly missed analyst forecasts. The company is implementing cost-cutting measures and sharpening its commercial focus following a recent stock decline driven by weaker U.S. sales growth projections for Wegovy and its diabetes drug, Ozempic. Novo Nordisk faces mounting competition from compounded drug makers and rival Eli Lilly, as well as potential U.S. government pressure on drug pricing.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the eastern German city of Dresden have ordered the evacuation of approximately 17,000 people to facilitate the defusal of a 250-kilogram British bomb from World War II. The unexploded ordnance was discovered during demolition work on the Carola Bridge, which had partially collapsed. The evacuation zone includes hotels and the city's renowned Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady), a major tourist landmark. This is the second such mass evacuation in Dresden this year, underscoring the persistent danger of unexploded bombs from the war even eight decades later.</p>

          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to maintain the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, projecting a return to shareholders of 9% to 11% this year. The forecast follows HSBC's recent announcement of a second-quarter dividend and a US$3 billion share buy-back program. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target for the bank's stock, expressing confidence that its capital buffer is sufficient to sustain dividend payments despite potential impairments related to its stake in China's Bank of Communications (Bocom).

          <p>In a significant strategic shift, OpenAI has launched two new open-source AI models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, marking its return to open models for the first time since 2019. The move is widely seen as a direct challenge to the growing number of popular open-source models emerging from China, such as Alibaba's Qwen family. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman described the new models as "the best and most usable" in the world, aiming to provide powerful, lower-cost options for developers and researchers. This development intensifies the global competition for dominance in the open-source AI landscape.</p>

          <p>China's campaign to resolve local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a list of 12 high-risk jurisdictions. The achievement was revealed in a local budget review, indicating progress in consolidating finances and controlling debt. This development follows a 2023 central government directive aimed at restructuring debt in heavily burdened areas over two years. Inner Mongolia had previously been forced to halt major infrastructure projects, like a new subway, due to its significant financial risks.</p>

          <h2>The Challenges Facing Crossover Athletes Transitioning to the NFL Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent decision by Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his 18-month attempt to break into the NFL highlights the immense difficulty crossover athletes face. Experts point to several key obstacles, including the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another major factor is the "planet theory," which posits that the pool of athletes with the ideal size and athleticism for skill positions like running back is vast, making it harder to stand out compared to linemen, where such athletes are rarer.</p>

          <p>China is actively strengthening its ties with Africa's leading coffee-producing nations to secure new supply chains for its booming domestic market. This strategy leverages zero-tariff policies for certain African imports and aims to "lock in supply" amid global trade uncertainties. Chinese companies like Cotti Coffee are spearheading this effort, signing agreements in Rwanda, Ethiopia, and Uganda to invest in coffee development and procure thousands of tons of beans annually. The push reflects China's broader goal of diversifying its resource procurement and deepening economic partnerships across the African continent.</p>

          <p>McLaren Racing CEO Zak Brown has expressed confidence that his drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, will not have a major falling out as they compete for the Formula 1 championship. With Piastri leading Norris by just nine points, Brown acknowledges that tension will likely grow but believes the mutual trust and respect between the two will prevent their rivalry from turning hostile. He stated that while he expects them to "swap paint again," he is positive they will not deliberately run each other off the track. The team plans to manage the relationship transparently as the title fight intensifies.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return from the injured list, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs to lead the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 12-6 victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. Muncy's performance provided a much-needed spark for the Dodgers' offense, which had struggled significantly during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. The game also saw positive contributions from other slumping hitters, including Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernández, who also hit two homers. Muncy's comeback serves as a major boost for the team's lineup down the stretch.</p>

          <p>Buscarita Roa, one of the last two active members of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, recounts her nearly 50-year search for grandchildren stolen during Argentina's military dictatorship. The group was formed by grandmothers demanding answers for an estimated 30,000 people who were "disappeared," including hundreds of babies given to military families. Roa describes the desperate search and the danger the Abuelas faced, eventually finding her own granddaughter, Claudia, in 2000. Now 87, she vows to never give up the search for the nearly 300 grandchildren who remain missing, a legacy now being carried on by those who have been found.</p>

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement for ESPN to acquire NFL Network, NFL Fantasy, and distribution rights for the RedZone channel. In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN, a deal that values the stake at over $2 billion. This framework, which still requires final negotiations and regulatory approval, would integrate the NFL's media assets into ESPN's ecosystem, significantly bolstering its upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service. The move represents a major strategic alignment between the nation's most powerful sports league and its largest sports media company.</p>
