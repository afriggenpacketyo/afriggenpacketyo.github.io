          <p>Princess Aiko, the only child of Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako, will make her first official overseas visit to Laos in November to commemorate the 70th anniversary of diplomatic ties between Japan and Laos, as the 23-year-old princess is scheduled to meet with Laotian President Thongloun Sisoulith and attend events related to the anniversary. Details of her visit are still under consideration, but this trip marks a significant step in her role within the Imperial Family, as she previously made informal trips to the Netherlands with her parents in 2006 and attended a summer course at Eton College in 2018.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reinstating in-person training at the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Maryland, after initially pausing it due to cost concerns, as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reversed its decision after a comprehensive review found that certain courses provide effective training, marking a reprieve for Emmitsburg, a town heavily reliant on the academy and visiting firefighters. The reversal followed criticism from Maryland's congressional delegation and firefighters, who argued that halting training for first responders was dangerous, and the administration also restored in-person training at the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, and at the National Disaster and Emergency Management University.</p>
