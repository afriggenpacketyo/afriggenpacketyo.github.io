          <p>San Diego Padres third baseman Manny Machado achieved a significant career milestone by recording his 2,000th hit during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He becomes the 297th player in MLB history to reach this mark and the fifth active player to do so. In the same game, Machado also hit his 15th home run of the season, further cementing his place as one of only 12 players in league history with 350 home runs and 2,000 hits by his age-32 season. Despite the personal achievement, the Padres ultimately lost the game 6-3.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of elimination to secure a place in the Wimbledon semi-finals, defeating veteran Laura Siegemund in a grueling three-set match. Sabalenka, the heavy favorite, struggled against Siegemund's unconventional style, losing the first set and falling behind twice in the final set before ultimately winning 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. The match, which lasted nearly three hours, tested Sabalenka's composure and determination. She will now face either Amanda Anisimova or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a spot in her first Wimbledon final.</p>

          <p>Amy Shack Egan, who started a wedding planning business a decade ago, has successfully launched a new tech startup called Cheersy, raising $550,000 in a pre-seed round with actress Kerry Washington as the lead investor. Cheersy is a digital platform designed to connect couples with pre-vetted wedding coordinators, addressing a common challenge for those planning their own events. Egan's journey from a reluctant wedding planner to a tech CEO was fueled by her desire to modernize the industry. The funding round also attracted other high-profile angel investors, validating her vision for a more accessible and inclusive wedding marketplace.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check: Experts Dismiss Conspiracy Theories Linking Texas Floods to Cloud Seeding</h2>

          <p>Conspiracy theories suggesting that "cloud seeding" operations caused or worsened the deadly Texas floods have been widely dismissed as false by meteorological experts. The claims, amplified by some political figures, attempted to link the disaster to weather modification activities conducted days earlier. However, scientists and weather professionals have unequivocally stated that cloud seeding cannot create a storm of such magnitude and is only capable of slightly enhancing rainfall from existing clouds. Experts further explained that any particles from the seeding operation would have dispersed long before the storm system that caused the catastrophic flooding developed.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Black Americans are moving abroad and report finding greater happiness, safety, and a sense of inclusion compared to their experiences in the United States. Many expats say that outside the U.S., they are often perceived as "American first" rather than being primarily defined by their race, leading to fewer encounters with discrimination. In addition to a more welcoming social environment, they also cite benefits like a better work-life balance and a lower cost of living, which allows them to achieve a lifestyle they felt was unattainable back home. This trend highlights a search for an "oasis" from systemic racial challenges in the U.S.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz has advanced to his first-ever Wimbledon semi-final after a hard-fought victory over Karen Khachanov in four sets. Fritz appeared dominant through the first two sets but experienced a sudden dip in the third, allowing Khachanov to force a fourth set. Despite a malfunction with the electronic line-calling system early in the fourth, Fritz regained his composure and clinched the match in a tie-break. The win marks a significant milestone for the No. 5 seed, who will now face either Carlos Alcaraz or Cameron Norrie for a place in the final.</p>

          <p>A year after his Conservative Party's significant election defeat, former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is returning to Goldman Sachs as a senior adviser. The investment bank announced that Sunak, who worked there in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical matters. His appointment was delayed by a governmental watchdog for one year to mitigate risks of unfair influence. Sunak, who remains a Member of Parliament, will donate his pay from the role to his charity, which focuses on improving numeracy skills.</p>

          <p>In a historic agreement, the Bayeux Tapestry will be loaned to the United Kingdom for the first time since its creation in the 11th century. The 70-meter-long embroidery, which depicts the Norman conquest of England in 1066, will be displayed at the British Museum starting in the autumn of 2026. The loan is part of a cultural exchange that will see British treasures, such as artifacts from Sutton Hoo, travel to France. This arrangement coincides with the renovation of the tapestry's home museum in Bayeux and marks a significant moment of Anglo-French cultural cooperation.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about a sharp spike in inflation due to tariffs have subsided. The June Survey of Consumer Expectations found that respondents anticipate inflation will be at 3% in one year, returning to the same level seen in January before the tariff rhetoric intensified. This marks a retreat from a peak of 3.6% in the spring. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific categories like medical care, rent, and college education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency, the NDRC, is seeking to bolster its economic monitoring and early-warning capabilities in response to global economic flux and erratic US tariff threats. The agency is commissioning studies to better assess the impact of trade barriers and refine its predictive indicators as it drafts the country's next five-year plan. This initiative signals a push for a more forward-looking approach to economic management, moving beyond traditional metrics to focus on supply-chain security and technological stability. The goal is to help China better navigate future volatility and intensified international competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing delivered 60 airplanes in the last month, its highest monthly total since December 2023, indicating a ramp-up in production of its 737 Max jets. The increase follows a period of slowed production and intense scrutiny after a door plug blew out mid-flight on a new aircraft in January 2024. Of the 60 planes, 42 were 737 Max models delivered to major airlines. This marks the company's best second-quarter performance since 2018, a crucial period before the two fatal Max crashes that plunged the manufacturer into a multi-year crisis from which it is still recovering.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Zohran Mamdani's Primary Win Offers a Lesson in Coalition-Building for the Left</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 11:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary as a model for successful progressive politics. It argues his win was secured through a strategic coalition that bridged ideological divides, notably his cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-described "progressive Zionist." Instead of demanding ideological purity, the alliance acknowledged differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while focusing on shared local goals. This approach attracted a broad base of support, including liberal Jewish and pro-Palestinian voters, and provides a roadmap for Democrats to build winning coalitions rather than alienating potential allies with purity tests.</p>
