          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating the Labour Party by just six votes after a recount. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, overturned a significant Labour majority to win the seat, marking a notable achievement for the right-wing party led by Nigel Farage. This victory is especially significant as it marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win, signaling a potential shift in the political landscape and posing challenges to both the Labour and Conservative parties. The by-election was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury, following his conviction for assaulting a constituent.</p>
