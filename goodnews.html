          <p>China is actively promoting its trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal, signaling a strategic effort to increase its influence in the region. A top Chinese official visited Nepal to advance cooperation in key sectors like agriculture, energy, and health, aiming to bolster Nepal's economic development. This initiative occurs as Beijing competes with New Delhi for sway over the landlocked nation, which has traditionally been a close ally of India but has recently seen a surge in Chinese investment. The move underscores the ongoing geopolitical contest for influence in South Asia.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has achieved the remarkable feat of riding his bike down all 282 of the country's Munros. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person ever to complete this challenge, which involves climbing each mountain over 3,000 feet with a bike and then cycling down. The epic journey took him approximately eight and a half years to finish, combining his passion for the outdoors and mountain biking. His accomplishment stands as a testament to extreme dedication and physical endurance.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits that surpassed analyst expectations, reaching 1.485 billion euros. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, even while facing headwinds from a stronger euro and mixed performance in its investment banking division. While fixed income and currency trading saw an 11% revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit experienced a 29% decline due to market uncertainty. The results reflect the bank's resilience amid a challenging European economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is launching a program to provide monthly subsidy coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly-care services. This initiative represents a rare use of direct fiscal support by Beijing, aiming to alleviate financial burdens on its aging population and stimulate the domestic care industry. The electronic vouchers, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed with moderate to severe disabilities. The policy is part of a broader effort to strengthen the social safety net and address demographic pressures.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate quashed. The ruling raises questions about the original prosecutions and may pave the way for other convicted traders to appeal. The case was a central part of the response to the 2008 financial crisis, and the reversal has led to calls for a public inquiry into the investigation.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's attempt to end birthright citizenship, affirming that the president's executive order is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's nationwide injunction that prevents the government from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen parents. The 2-1 decision stated that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause is incorrect. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda and moves the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

Research published in The Lancet Public Health found this more achievable target is linked to a reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. The 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan and is not based on scientific evidence. Researchers suggest that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to adopt a practical and effective way to improve their health.</p>
