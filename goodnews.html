          <p>Canada's women's rugby team secured a landmark victory against the six-time champion New Zealand Black Ferns, ending their 11-year undefeated streak in the World Cup. The Canadian team dominated the match from the start, scoring four tries in the first half to establish a commanding lead. This sensational win propels Canada into only their second-ever World Cup final, where they will have a chance to claim their first world title.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased, with the 10-year note reaching its highest point in two weeks, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction reflects investor focus on broader economic indicators beyond short-term rates, such as rising GDP estimates and slight inflation increases. While the Fed signaled more cuts are likely, recent positive data, like fewer jobless claims, has eased concerns about a significant economic slowdown. Investors now await the personal consumption expenditures index for further inflation insights. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research predicts a significant increase in U.S. electricity demand, driven largely by the buildout of AI data centers. This projected growth is seen as a strong tailwind for industrial companies like GE Vernova and Eaton. GE Vernova, which manufactures gas turbines, is experiencing a substantial backlog, giving it strong pricing power. Eaton produces essential electrical equipment for data centers and the grid, positioning it to capitalize on the infrastructure expansion required to meet the new power needs.

The public can now once again climb the 424 stairs to access the belfry and famous gargoyles, offering panoramic views of Paris. This achievement fulfills Macron's promise to complete the primary restoration within five years, a project costing nearly $1 billion. While the main structure is reborn, further renovation work on other parts of the historic cathedral will continue.</p>

          <p>The Treasury and IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" policy, which allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028. The guidance clarifies which occupations are eligible, while excluding jobs in sectors like healthcare, legal, and financial services. Importantly, the regulations specify that automatic gratuities, such as those added for large parties, will not qualify for the deduction because they are not voluntary. The new tax break is considered complex, and final rules will be issued after a public comment period.</p>

          <h2>Experts Identify Cost-Effective Borrowing Options Following Recent Fed Rate Cut</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, several borrowing methods have become more affordable for consumers. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are highlighted as one of the cheapest options, with average rates below those of home equity loans and personal loans. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that is still less expensive than credit card debt. As rates trend downward, these products present more accessible financing opportunities for qualified borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Panama Canal Authority is taking steps to win back liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker traffic that was lost during recent years of drought. Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and are developing a new 76-kilometer pipeline as an alternative for moving natural gas liquids across the isthmus. This "Interoceanic Energy Corridor" would free up canal slots for other vessels and could move 2.5 million barrels of energy products daily. These initiatives aim to make the canal more flexible and reliable for the crucial energy trade sector.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a new funding round that would value the company at $200 billion. This massive valuation reflects the intense investor appetite for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale funding for competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report, the funds would likely be used to build out the significant computing infrastructure required for advanced AI development.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet basic court requirements. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday stated the filing was repetitive, superfluous, and functioned more as a "platform to rage against an adversary" than a proper legal document. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint that adheres to federal rules. The New York Times welcomed the swift ruling, describing the original lawsuit as a political document intended to stifle independent reporting.</p>

The last official state visit by a reigning British monarch was in 2007 by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Trump has often expressed admiration for the British monarchy, and the visit would aim to underscore the "special relationship" between the two nations.</p>
