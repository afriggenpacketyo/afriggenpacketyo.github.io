          <p>During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, President Trump lauded Nippon Steel as a "great partner" for U.S. Steel, signaling support for the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain controlled by the USA, a condition for his approval of the deal, and promised to raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, a plan that faced scrutiny during the 2024 election due to concerns over national security. Trump highlighted the investment as the largest in Pennsylvania's history and assured that all U.S. Steel workers would keep their jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British officials are proceeding with trade negotiations with the U.S. despite a recent court decision that overturned many of Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The UK hopes to finalize deals covering cars, metals, and airplane parts in the coming weeks, viewing the court ruling as likely to be overturned by the Supreme Court. A UK team met with U.S. officials to discuss implementing the trade deal, which includes provisions for British car exports and tariff reductions on steel and aluminum. Trump unexpectedly announced he would be doubling foreign tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, creating uncertainty about the previously negotiated trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are driving a surge in inbound travel to Japan, exceeding pre-pandemic levels from 2019, with a total of 3.13 million visitors in the first four months of this year. Unlike the past, where Chinese tourism was marked by large group tours and shopping sprees, travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The shift is driven by Chinese travelers in their 30s and 40s, who often opt for family trips over group tours. The Japan National Tourism Organization is targeting this market by enhancing its social media presence.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that he and U.S. Cabinet members have agreed that they are making progress toward a potential tariff deal, possibly as early as next month.

Japan continues to demand the removal of all additional U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized the importance of a win-win relationship through increased Japanese investment in the U.S. rather than tariffs.

During a rally, Trump stated that Nippon would invest $14 billion, with funds allocated for increasing steel production in Pittsburgh and modernizing mills across several states. He also announced a plan to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and promised no layoffs, outsourcing, or a $5,000 bonus for every U.S. Steel worker.

          <p>China is transforming its traditional mining industry by introducing driverless electric vehicles, exemplified by a fleet of 100 photovoltaic-battery-powered, self-driving trucks at the Yimin open-pit coal mine in Inner Mongolia. This represents the world's largest deployment of autonomous electric mining trucks, addressing a shortage of drivers and improving safety. The move aligns with China's push to digitally transform its coal industry, making it more efficient and sustainable. The initiative stems from government guidance issued in 2020, which outlined the construction of intelligent mines and identified autonomous driving as a strategic goal.</p>

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a California judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, meaning that Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts remain on pause. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the White House's request to freeze the injunction, stating that the Executive Order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. Judge Susan Illston's order questioned whether President Trump's administration was acting lawfully in trying to pare the federal workforce. The administration had sought an emergency stay of an injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities.</p>
