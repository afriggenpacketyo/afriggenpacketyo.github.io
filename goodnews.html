          <p>China is demonstrating a novel approach to environmental policy, achieving substantial reductions in air and water pollution without deindustrialization. Through massive investments in green technology, real-time environmental monitoring, and cutting-edge infrastructure, the nation has significantly improved its environmental indicators. Research shows a 35.6% drop in average annual PM2.5 levels from 2015 to 2022, an improvement comparable to what the U.S. achieved over three decades. This strategy of industrialization-driven decarbonization allows for continued factory output while simultaneously advancing environmental goals, marking a significant shift in sustainable development models.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nebius Group, a provider of Nvidia graphics chips for AI training, skyrocketed over 60% following the announcement of a massive infrastructure deal with Microsoft. The agreement, valued at up to $19.4 billion over five years, will see Amsterdam-based Nebius deliver significant computing resources to support Microsoft's growing AI workloads. This partnership reflects a broader trend of major tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI turning to third-party suppliers to meet the intense demand for AI-specialized cloud infrastructure. The deal has boosted Nebius's market capitalization, which had already more than doubled this year prior to the announcement.</p>

          <p>The family of media magnate Rupert Murdoch has finalized a succession plan that ensures his chosen heir, Lachlan Murdoch, will maintain control of the media empire, including Fox Corp., after his death. The agreement effectively ends a long-running family drama often compared to the TV show "Succession." Under the terms of the deal, Lachlan's three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will relinquish their claims to control of the company. In exchange, they will receive stock currently valued at approximately $3.3 billion, securing the conservative direction of outlets like Fox News for the foreseeable future.</p>

In recent interviews, Sheen revealed that his past substance abuse led to sexual encounters with men, which resulted in him paying people to maintain their silence. Now eight years sober, he also discussed how drinking was a way to cope with a stutter and the "tremendous relief" of publicly disclosing his HIV-positive status in 2015. Sheen expressed some regrets but emphasized that there is no value in dwelling on them, choosing instead to own his stories.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent attendance at a military parade in Beijing alongside other world leaders signifies a major diplomatic victory and a shift in his international standing. Once viewed as the leader of an isolated pariah state, Kim's appearance marks his transformation into an influential global figure, a stark contrast to a decade ago when South Korea's president held a similar place of honor. This diplomatic achievement is the culmination of years of strategic moves, including direct negotiations with a U.S. president, which have elevated North Korea's position on the world stage. The event underscores a fundamental change in geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>

          <h2>Coyote Filmed Swimming Across San Francisco Bay to Angel Island</h2>

          <p>State park staff in San Francisco captured rare footage of a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep channel separating mainland Marin County from Angel Island. This sighting provides a fascinating glimpse into how a budding coyote population, first established on the island in 2017, likely made the journey. Researchers believe the original breeding pair swam over a mile through strong currents, and the current population of 14 to 17 coyotes are all related to a single matriarch. The event highlights the adaptability of coyotes as they expand their presence throughout the Bay Area, with park officials noting that the animals are strong swimmers.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners, who purchased the property in 2023 with plans to raze it and expand their adjacent estate, had filed a legal challenge against the landmark status. However, the judge rejected their claim, siding with preservationists and fans who argue the house is an indelible piece of Hollywood history. Monroe bought the Spanish Colonial-style hacienda in 1962 and died there six months later, making it the only home she ever owned by herself.</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has fully reopened after a "hazardous materials" scare prompted a partial evacuation of Terminal 4 on Monday. Emergency services, including the London Fire Brigade and specialist police officers, were called to the scene to investigate, leading to a temporary closure of the check-in area. After a thorough search, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that no trace of any adverse substance was found. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics at the scene, with one individual taken to the hospital as a precaution, though no one was deemed to be in a life-threatening condition. The airport apologized for the disruption to travelers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve being widely expected to cut interest rates in September, opening a high-yield savings account remains a worthwhile strategy for many savers. While returns are no longer at their peak, rates on these accounts are still exponentially higher—nearly 1,000% more—than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Experts suggest that any initial rate cuts will likely be gradual, meaning savers can still benefit from the higher yields in the near term. Furthermore, these accounts offer crucial liquidity and access to funds, which is a key advantage over fixed-term products like CDs in an unpredictable economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has recently dropped to its lowest level since last October, it remains significantly higher than pandemic-era lows. Financial experts advise that prospective homebuyers can take proactive steps to secure better loan terms regardless of market fluctuations. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and reducing revolving debt, which can substantially lower the offered interest rate. Additionally, providing a larger down payment of 20% or more can lead to more favorable terms from lenders and help borrowers avoid the extra cost of private mortgage insurance.

The inclusion, which will be effective September 22, ends months of speculation and is a significant milestone for the company. Being added to the benchmark index typically acts as a major catalyst for a stock, as it triggers buying from passive index funds that track the S&P 500. The news marks a positive turn for Robinhood, whose stock has now risen more than 210% year-to-date, recovering strongly since its 2021 public offering.</p>
