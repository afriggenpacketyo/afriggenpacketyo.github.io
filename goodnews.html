          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, many retirees are considering annuities for guaranteed income. This article examines the potential monthly payout from a $300,000 immediate fixed annuity purchased at age 65. Based on current rates, a 65-year-old man could expect about $1,942 per month, while a woman could receive around $1,861, with the difference due to life expectancy. The article stresses that annuities involve trade-offs, such as sacrificing liquidity for a predictable income stream, and advises considering factors like inflation risk and tax implications before investing.

          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are holding a multi-day, multi-million dollar wedding celebration in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of celebrity guests. The lavish event, estimated to cost between $64 million and $76 million, includes multiple parties and a ceremony on the private island of San Giorgio Maggiore. However, the extravagant affair has sparked protests from local residents and activists, who criticize the use of the historic city as a playground for the ultra-wealthy and highlight the pressures of over-tourism. Protest groups like "No Space for Bezos" argue the event underscores the city's struggle to meet the needs of its residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A legal analysis of the recent Supreme Court decision suggests its primary impact is on the scope of judicial power, not the core issue of birthright citizenship. The ruling focused on reining in "nationwide injunctions," a procedural tool used by lower courts to block executive actions. While the case arose from President Trump's attempt to alter birthright citizenship, the court's conservative majority deliberately avoided the policy's merits. The article argues that the decision is a significant, if technical, shift in judicial authority that has broad implications for future legal challenges against any presidential administration.</p>

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis has launched an aggressive turnaround plan to revive the Stellantis truck brand, which has seen its sales decline by 38% since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, acknowledged that production issues with the redesigned Ram 1500 and other problems led to the brand's slump. The plan aims to restore Ram's market share in the highly profitable full-size pickup truck segment, which is crucial for Stellantis's overall success.</p>

This shift marks a change from the post-pandemic "revenge spending" splurge, with many consumers now focusing on building emergency funds and cutting discretionary spending.
