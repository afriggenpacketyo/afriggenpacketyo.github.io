          <p>Japan and the United States are planning a summit between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 leaders' meeting in Canada. Before the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator will visit Washington for further negotiations on Trump's tariffs.

          <p>A recall on Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded due to a serious health risk, as cans labeled "zero sugar" were found to contain the full amount of sugar present in regular Dr Pepper. The FDA upgraded the recall to Class II, indicating potential temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company, were distributed in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. This mislabeling poses a risk to individuals needing to avoid sugar, particularly those with diabetes, as consuming excessive sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat rising prices of the staple food. The released rice, consisting of harvests from 2020 and 2021, will be sold through direct contracts with retailers. This move aims to lower prices for consumers, particularly smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops.

He also touches on the city's German heritage and the historical tensions between nativists and German immigrants.

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have dramatically decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses for those aged 20 to 29. Data from the CDC indicates that fentanyl and other drugs killed roughly 16,690 people under 35 last year, a significant drop from over 31,000 in 2021. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens. However, challenges remain for those struggling with severe addiction, and potential funding cuts could jeopardize this progress. </p>
