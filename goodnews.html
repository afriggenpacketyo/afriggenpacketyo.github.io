          <p>The San Francisco 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26-23 in a tense overtime game, improving their season record to 4-1. The 49ers' defense made a crucial fourth-down stop in overtime to seal the win after kicker Eddy Pineiro successfully made a 41-yard field goal. Quarterback Mac Jones, filling in for an injured Brock Purdy, had a strong performance with 342 passing yards and two touchdowns. The game saw both teams trading blows, with the Rams fighting back from a deficit to force overtime before ultimately falling short in the divisional matchup.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered over 1,000 Spanish silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, off the coast of Florida. The treasure is believed to be from a fleet of ships that sank during a hurricane in 1715 while transporting wealth from Spanish colonies back to Spain. The discovery is historically significant because many of the coins, minted in Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru, still have visible dates and mint marks. Under Florida law, the state retains ownership of such historical artifacts, though the salvage company, Queen Jewels, will likely be compensated for its recovery efforts.</p>

Data from marketing platform Sojern shows that international attendees are increasingly combining the race with trips to other destinations like Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. This trend transforms the event from a single stop into a regional tourism hub, attracting business travelers and families who extend their stays. Travel companies are capitalizing on this by offering bundled packages that pair the Grand Prix with excursions to nearby countries, boosting the economies of neighboring nations.</p>

Companies such as Anduril Industries and Palantir are developing advanced, software-first solutions in areas critical to national security, including AI, autonomy, and cyber warfare. This shift is driven by the changing nature of global conflicts, which now involve cyber and space domains.

          <p>A house being relocated by barge from Orange Beach to Innerarity Point, Alabama, has become stuck on a sandbar shortly after beginning its journey. The trip, which was expected to take only three hours, was halted when the barge ran aground in Perdido Key. The moving company was waiting for high tide to hopefully dislodge the vessel and continue the transport. The home, originally built in 1981, was purchased by a new owner who had long admired its timeless design and wished to save it from demolition, highlighting the unique challenges involved in preserving and moving entire structures.</p>

          <p>A corgi shepherd mix named Opie, who disappeared from his Northern California home during a storm in July, has been found over 2,000 miles away in a Chicago suburb. The dog was turned in as a stray, and a scan of his microchip revealed his owner's contact information, leading to a joyful reunion. The owner, who immediately flew to Illinois to retrieve her pet, believes Opie may have been taken from a local gas station after he ran off. The incident highlights the critical importance of microchipping pets and keeping the registered contact information up to date.</p>

          <p>In an act of compassion, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has raised more than $300,000 for the family of the gunman who attacked a Michigan chapel, killing four people. David Butler, a Utah-based author, said he was motivated by his faith's teachings to 'love our enemies' and care for the widowed and orphaned after learning the suspect left behind a wife and children, including one with a chronic illness. Despite some backlash, the crowdfunding campaign far exceeded its initial $10,000 goal, with thousands of donors, many of them fellow church members, contributing to support the family.</p>

          <p>Alpha School in Austin, Texas, is pioneering an educational model where artificial intelligence, not teachers, guides academic lessons for an annual tuition of $40,000. Students spend two hours daily on core subjects using personalized AI software, allowing them to learn at their own pace, while adults act as 'guides' to motivate them. The afternoons are dedicated to life skills like financial literacy and public speaking. While the school boasts top-tier standardized test scores, the model has drawn skepticism from traditional educators who question the effectiveness of replacing teacher expertise with algorithms and the high cost of attendance.</p>

          <p>FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary has praised the White House's new 'TrumpRx' initiative as a 'major step' toward making prescription drugs more affordable for Americans. The plan involves a direct-to-consumer platform where pharmaceutical companies, starting with Pfizer, will offer medications at significant discounts, aligning prices with those paid in Europe. For example, the arthritis drug Xeljanz could see its price drop from $6,000 to $3,600 per month. While the administration hails the program as a breakthrough, some health policy experts express skepticism, questioning how many patients will benefit and whether the discounts will be sufficient for high-cost drugs.</p>

          <p>As respiratory illnesses circulate this autumn, a medical expert offers advice on how to differentiate between the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19. Colds typically develop gradually with nasal symptoms, while the flu often brings more severe body aches and fever. COVID-19 can present similarly to the flu but may also include a loss of taste or smell, a 'razor-sharp' sore throat, or diarrhea as key identifiers. The article recommends rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medications like paracetamol for management, while also advising when to seek medical attention for persistent or severe symptoms.</p>
