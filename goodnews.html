        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. James Butterfill of CoinShares noted that broader macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. Recent regulatory developments, such as the GENIUS Act, and a pro-crypto agenda from U.S. leaders, including JPMorgan's acceptance of Bitcoin for clients, further supported the market's rise. Bitcoin's divergence from traditional equity markets suggests investors are seeking alternative stores of value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Government borrowing in the UK was higher than expected in April, reaching ¬£20.2 billion, an increase of ¬£1 billion compared to April of the previous year. This figure surpasses analysts' predictions of ¬£17.9 billion. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), this is the fourth-highest April borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993. The increased borrowing reflects the difference between government spending and tax income during the month.</p>
