Social media accounts briefly displayed "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" branding before its removal, signaling his potential intentions. Beutner, who previously served as a high-level aide to Mayor Villaraigosa and publisher of the Los Angeles Times, would be a significant contender. His potential run comes amidst various crises faced by Mayor Bass, including a large budget shortfall and public criticism over emergency responses.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will define the nation's development priorities for the coming half-decade. This plan is anticipated to influence infrastructure spending and investment, moving towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. While past stimulus packages fueled rapid economic growth, they also contributed to local government debt. Economists remain optimistic about continued infrastructure investment, despite existing financial pressures in some regions.</p>

          <p>China has launched a commercial underwater data center in Hainan, aiming for global AI leadership and increased internet traffic. However, an opinion article suggests that US-Gulf partnerships could thwart China's ambitions in the $242 billion data center industry. The Trump administration has facilitated multi-billion-dollar deals for chip supplies to the UAE, supporting the construction of large AI data centers. The article highlights the US's growing lead in data center build-up, driven by significant investment and collaboration between the government and chip producers like Nvidia, posing a challenge to China's near-term dominance.</p>
