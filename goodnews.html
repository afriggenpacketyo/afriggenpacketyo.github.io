          <p>Evelyn Palla, 52, has been named the new chief executive of Germany's state-owned rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), succeeding Richard Lutz amidst mounting reliability and infrastructural issues. Palla, an Italian national, previously headed DB Regio, the subsidiary overseeing regional operations. This article notes that her appointment was welcomed by the train drivers' union and passenger advocacy groups, who praised her experience and focus on punctuality. Despite ongoing problems, public transportation use in Germany increased in the first half of 2025, though the initial boom from the Deutschlandticket appears to be waning due to rising prices.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth. The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway 12 meters for regular use, alongside terminal expansions, expected to increase annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. This article notes Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates thousands of jobs and billions in investment, despite strong opposition from climate campaigners who deem it a "disaster." Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and enhanced public transport targets to mitigate environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Silent Hill f is being celebrated as one of the boldest, darkest, and best entries in the horror series, marking a tremendous achievement after a decade of neglect. This article praises the new game for deeply understanding the franchise's psychological horror appeal while taking risks with its 1960s Japan setting and narrative. It follows Hinako, a teenage girl whose domestic troubles intertwine with a descent into rot and monsters, constantly draped in ambiguity. The game explores societal and cultural norms influencing mental breakdown, offering a rich, interpretative puzzle with artfully crafted cutscenes and relentless pacing, despite some overreliance on combat.</p>

          <p>The 45th Ryder Cup is poised for a critical opening session on Friday, with both European and US teams aiming for a strong start, particularly in the demanding alternate shot foursomes. This article highlights that US captain Keegan Bradley is sticking to this format, which has often dictated overall outcomes, while Europe, led by Luke Donald, seeks to replicate their dominant 4-0 lead from Rome. Europe's more experienced team, with only one rookie, contrasts with the US team's four first-timers. The article suggests that a close contest in the early exchanges could lead to a much-needed epic conclusion.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un to freeze North Korea's nuclear weapons production as an "interim emergency measure," rather than insisting on immediate denuclearization. This article reports that Lee believes a freeze is a "feasible, realistic alternative" given North Korea's annual production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons. Lee, who seeks to reduce tensions and restore peaceful relations, expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume talks due to their "degree of mutual trust," which could benefit South Korea and global peace. He emphasizes pragmatism in navigating the peninsula's complex security challenges.</p>

          <p>Research continues to explore the complex relationship between the birth control pill and women's libido, with some women reporting a significant drop in sex drive. This article highlights accounts from women who experienced reduced libido and physical side effects like vaginal dryness, often without prior warning from doctors. While a 2013 review found about 15% of women reported decreased desire, the majority experienced no change or an increase, possibly due to pregnancy-related anxiety relief. Researchers suggest the pill's effect on testosterone, by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), may reduce "free testosterone" and thus sexual desire.</p>

          <p>World Athletics president Sebastian Coe suggests the global calendar for Olympic sports may need "re-engineering" to address challenges posed by climate change, especially after athletes faced extreme heat in Tokyo. This article reports that Coe believes events like the marathon might need to be held separately at different times of the year to protect athletes from unsafe conditions. Research indicates 70% of athletes report climate change impacting their training and competition. Coe emphasizes that governments have not adequately addressed the issue, pushing for collective action within the Olympic movement to adapt the international sporting calendar.</p>
