          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence firm, xAI, has reportedly raised $10 billion in a new funding round, elevating its valuation to $200 billion. This significant capital injection reflects the intense investor interest in foundational AI models, placing xAI in closer competition with industry leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic. The funds are expected to be used to build out massive data centers with advanced AI chips and to attract top talent in the competitive AI landscape. This move signals Musk's ambition to create a major challenger in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against the New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint was overly repetitive and failed to provide a "short and plain statement" as required by court rules. The judge characterized the filing as a platform to "rage against an adversary" rather than a proper legal complaint. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to file an amended version that complies with the court's procedural standards. A spokesperson for Trump stated they will continue to pursue the lawsuit.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 13:53:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has provided tangible relief to the mortgage market, with average 30-year fixed rates falling to approximately 6.13%. This reduction translates into significant savings for homebuyers, particularly those with large loans. For a $750,000 mortgage, the monthly payment is now over $450 lower than it would have been at the start of 2025, representing an annual savings of about $5,400. The move enhances affordability for new buyers and creates attractive refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has expressed support for two more interest rate cuts this year, a more dovish stance than he previously held. He believes that President Trump's tariffs are likely to have only a one-time, temporary effect on inflation, rather than a persistent one, leaving room for the central bank to ease policy further. Kashkari's view is primarily driven by concerns over a weakening labor market, which he argues outweighs the current inflation levels that are above the Fed's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland have unveiled a new joint deal to manage the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to replace a widely opposed UK law. This new framework establishes a reformed Legacy Commission with independent oversight and facilitates cross-border cooperation, including a dedicated legacy unit within the Irish police. While officials describe it as the "best, and last, opportunity" to provide answers for victims' families, the plan has received a mixed reaction, reflecting the deep-seated complexities of the issue.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a significant inflationary effect on the U.S. economy. Placing himself in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee, Miran argued that while tariffs cause relative price changes, they do not create the kind of macroeconomic inflation that requires a monetary policy response. He was the lone dissenter in the recent vote to cut rates, advocating for a larger half-point reduction based on his assessment of economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

The policy, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child, a measure that think tanks estimate has pushed hundreds of thousands of children into poverty.</p>
