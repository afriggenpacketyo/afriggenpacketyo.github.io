        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A renewed interest in nuclear energy is gaining momentum, fueled by the immense power demands of artificial intelligence and data centers, though significant financial and political obstacles remain. Global investments in the nuclear sector are projected to reach $2.2 trillion by 2025, with tech companies actively funding development. However, the industry is plagued by challenges, including vast capital requirements, long construction times, and budget overruns that make private financing difficult without government support. Experts emphasize that public-private partnerships are crucial to mitigate risks and unlock nuclear power's potential as a reliable, 24/7 clean energy source to meet escalating global electricity needs.

          <p>Volkswagen is intensifying its efforts to dominate the European electric vehicle market by introducing a new family of affordable and compact EVs. The company recently unveiled the ID.

This model is part of a broader strategy to make electromobility more accessible and expand its current 28% market share in Europe. Volkswagen's CEO, Oliver Blume, highlighted significant improvements in software and battery technology, including a new unified cell concept, as key drivers of the company's competitive edge in the increasingly crowded EV space.</p>

          <p>China has extended its streak of gold acquisitions for the 22nd consecutive month, adding 60,000 ounces in August to bolster its reserves amid geopolitical uncertainty. This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce reliance on the US dollar, increasing its gold holdings to a record 7.64% of its total foreign exchange reserves. The persistent buying from China and other central banks reflects a global trend of seeking stable assets, which has helped drive up gold prices. This shift is significant, as foreign central banks now collectively hold more gold than US Treasuries for the first time in nearly three decades. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union Agency for Asylum reported a significant 23% drop in asylum applications during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was primarily driven by a remarkable 66% reduction in applications from Syrian nationals, a change attributed to the ouster of the Assad regime and a growing hope for stability and reconstruction in Syria. Germany, previously the top destination, saw the largest decline in applications at 43%, followed by Italy and Spain. Consequently, Syrians, who were once the largest group of asylum seekers, now rank third behind Venezuelans and Afghans.</p>

          <p>Cyprus has approached the United Arab Emirates to explore a potential partnership in the development of a major EU-financed subsea power cable intended to connect the Eastern Mediterranean with Europe. The announcement by Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides reaffirms the country's commitment to the ambitious €1.9 billion project, which aims to link the power grids of Greece, Cyprus, and Israel. This move follows a recent investigation launched by European prosecutors into possible criminal offenses related to the project's delays. The proposed cable would be the world's longest and deepest high-voltage link, enhancing energy security and integration across the region.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia is set to inaugurate the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), a monumental project on the Blue Nile expected to double the nation's electricity output and transform it into a major power exporter. For many Ethiopians, the dam represents a beacon of hope for development and access to reliable electricity for the first time. However, the project remains a source of significant tension with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan, who fear the dam will reduce their access to vital water resources. Despite these concerns, Ethiopia insists the dam will benefit the entire region by regulating water flow and providing clean energy.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Monday, with investor attention focused on a critical no-confidence vote in France that could oust Prime Minister Francois Bayrou. Major indices like Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 saw early gains, reflecting a cautiously optimistic start to the week. The French political situation remains a key point of uncertainty, as Bayrou's potential removal would force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years. Meanwhile, investors are also anticipating key U.S. inflation data later in the week, which could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>In his debut with the Pittsburgh Steelers, quarterback Aaron Rodgers led his new team to a dramatic 34-32 victory over his former team, the New York Jets. The 41-year-old quarterback demonstrated that he still possesses elite talent, throwing for 244 yards and four touchdowns in a compelling performance. While no longer the mobile player of his MVP years, Rodgers showcased his high football IQ and powerful arm, effectively managing the offense and punishing the Jets' defense. The game, which was sealed by a 60-yard field goal, served as a powerful statement from Rodgers after his difficult and unproductive tenure in New York.</p>

          <p>Private equity giants are aggressively recruiting talent, particularly for fundraising and investor relations roles, as they prepare for a rebound in dealmaking activity. After a slowdown caused by rising interest rates, firms are now investing heavily in distribution teams to secure capital from limited partners in a constrained liquidity environment. This hiring spree has sparked a talent war with investment banks, which have implemented new rules to prevent their junior analysts from being poached. The competition is driven by the lucrative compensation in private equity, particularly carried interest, which offers financial rewards far exceeding those in traditional investment banking.

          <p>Norwegians are voting in a parliamentary election where the ruling Labour Party is expected to secure a narrow victory, allowing its left-leaning alliance to remain in power. Opinion polls suggest the coalition will win a slim majority in parliament, though with fewer seats than in the 2021 election. The campaign has been dominated by domestic issues such as inflation and the cost of living, but international instability, including the war in Ukraine and U.S. trade policies, has also been a significant factor. Observers believe that the global uncertainty may have bolstered support for the incumbent government, as voters prioritize stability during tumultuous times.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's planned resignation, former economic security minister Sanae Takaichi has become a leading candidate to succeed him, potentially becoming Japan's first female prime minister. Opinion polls show Takaichi with strong support, narrowly leading other contenders like agriculture minister Shinjiro Koizumi. Analysts suggest that Japanese voters are more prepared for a female leader than ever before, citing the country's high female labor participation rate. Takaichi is known for her strong policy ideas and is viewed by some as a radical force for change, while Koizumi is seen as a safer, more traditional choice who could build consensus with opposition parties.</p>

Pundits and former players found the remarks disrespectful, pointing out that Germany also frequently employed long balls during the match. The comments were interpreted as a deflection from Germany's own underwhelming performance, as they were held to a 1-1 draw for nearly 70 minutes by the underdog Northern Irish side.</p>
