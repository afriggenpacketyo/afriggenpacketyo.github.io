          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, Tower 208, was dismantled and removed via helicopter for testing to determine its role in the Eaton fire. The tower, unused for over 50 years, is suspected of becoming reenergized through induction, potentially sparking the fire. The tower will be examined and tested in a laboratory setting by fire investigators, SCE officials, and experts hired by plaintiffs suing the utility company. SCE also updated its internal manual detailing how crews should ground idle transmission towers, indicating a change in procedure after the fire.</p>

Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag.
