          <p>The New York Times reports on a concerning trend: an increasing number of older women are seeking treatment for anorexia. Many of these women have struggled with eating disorders for decades without receiving help. This highlights the need for greater awareness and understanding of eating disorders across all age groups. It also underscores the importance of accessible and age-appropriate treatment options for older adults facing these challenges.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is reintroducing snack wraps to its U.S. menu next month, seeking to boost sales after a slow start to the year. The fast-food chain initially offered snack wraps nearly two decades ago but discontinued them in 2016 due to kitchen efficiency concerns. The return of the snack wrap on July 10 comes as McDonald's faces slowing sales, partly due to cautious consumer spending. This time, the snack wraps will feature McCrispy Strips and come in spicy and ranch flavors, marking McDonald's broader push into the chicken market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that Pepto Bismol may not be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea. The study found no significant difference in diarrhea symptoms between participants who took Pepto Bismol and those who took a placebo. While bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, is FDA-approved for treating diarrhea, its off-label use for prevention is now being questioned. The authors suggest further research is needed to determine if there are specific traveler groups or circumstances where the medication may be beneficial.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's newly elected president, rose from a childhood marked by poverty and factory work to become a prominent political figure.

Lee's campaign focused on restoring democratic norms and providing a safety net for vulnerable citizens.

          <p>The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a tool used to measure air pollution levels and communicate associated health risks. It uses a color-coded system ranging from green (good) to maroon (hazardous) to indicate the severity of pollution. The AQI is calculated based on five major pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. High AQI values indicate potential health impacts, ranging from headaches to severe cardiovascular issues, especially for sensitive groups like children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions.</p>
