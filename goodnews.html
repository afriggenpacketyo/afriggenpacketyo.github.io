She recounted an incident from her school days where she reported a classmate for cheating, leading to his expulsion, illustrating her strong stance against rule-breaking. Badenoch also discussed losing her religious faith while remaining a "cultural Christian" and criticized what she perceived as low academic expectations for Black students in 1990s London. She insisted her political drive is to address such issues and that she has always succeeded despite being underestimated.</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a brief and joyous return to the Hollywood Bowl, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The performance featured a unique pairing of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho playing both of Ravel's jazz-influenced piano concertos. While the concert was a homecoming celebration, it was also bittersweet due to the upcoming cancellation of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra's planned visit. The review praises the orchestra's versatility but notes that the large venue was not ideal for the nuances of Ravel's compositions.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its investment in United States manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic commitment to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones are eventually made in America. The investment is seen as an effort by Apple to navigate the administration's tariff threats, particularly on goods produced in China and India. As part of the plan, Apple will also hire 20,000 U.S. workers and expand its domestic supply chain.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect the public from unsafe practitioners. Under the new proposals, clinics will need to obtain a license to offer popular treatments like Botox and dermal fillers, ensuring they meet strict safety and training standards. More high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which has been welcomed by the industry, follows growing concerns over dangerous complications and a death linked to an unregulated procedure.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if they slightly miss their offered grades. This flexibility is attributed to universities seeking the financial stability that domestic undergraduates provide amid uncertainty in international student enrollment. With A-level results due next week, universities are reportedly making more offers to UK-domiciled students to fill their courses. This trend suggests a more competitive environment among institutions, which ultimately benefits applicants by giving them more choice.</p>

However, his strong individual performance was not enough to secure a victory, as the Dodgers' bullpen faltered in the later innings, leading to a 5-3 loss.

          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, which would be the fifth reduction since last August. A lower rate would reduce borrowing costs for some mortgage holders but would also lead to lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation, with zero growth recorded in April and May. While inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target, a cooling employment market may be providing the justification for the expected rate cut to stimulate economic activity.

          <p>New archaeological evidence suggests that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live among the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe some residents who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by other settlers, established a precarious settlement within the devastated city. This informal settlement existed until the 5th century, with people inhabiting the upper floors of buried homes. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned, revealing a previously overlooked chapter of post-disaster survival and reoccupation in the ancient world.</p>
