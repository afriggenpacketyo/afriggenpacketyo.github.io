          <h2>Ancient Rice Remains Discovered in Guam, Earliest Evidence in Remote Oceania</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:03:58 EDT</div>

          <p>Archaeologists in Guam have unearthed 3,500-year-old rice remains at the Ritidian Site Complex, marking the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania. The remnants, found as phytoliths on ancient earthenware pottery, suggest rice played a role in rituals within a cave that also contained fine pottery and burial pits. This discovery indicates the first settlers of Guam transported and successfully cultivated rice after their record-setting ocean migration. The findings offer a unique glimpse into the cultural practices and agricultural achievements of these early inhabitants.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has introduced a preview of Kiro, an artificial intelligence program designed to assist developers in writing code. CEO Andy Jassy believes Kiro has the potential to "transform how developers build software" by streamlining the "vibe coding" process. Kiro can generate diagrams for application data flow and create task lists, aiming to simplify the complex aspects of AI-assisted software development. The program currently uses AI models from Anthropic, with plans for additional language support and model alternatives in the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the new academic year approaches, students and families must strategically choose between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. Federal loans offer fixed rates and crucial protections like income-driven repayment and forgiveness options, making them generally the preferred first step, despite borrowing limits. Private loans, from banks and credit unions, can bridge funding gaps with higher borrowing caps and potentially lower rates, but lack the same flexibility and protections. The article advises exhausting federal options first and then carefully comparing private lenders to ensure a manageable repayment plan. (not investment advice)</p>
