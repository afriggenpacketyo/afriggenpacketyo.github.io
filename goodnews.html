          <p>Bitcoin's value has surged to a new record, exceeding $122,000, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is supported by increasing institutional investment and anticipation of clearer U.S. cryptocurrency regulations, with several crypto-related bills currently under deliberation in Congress. Analysts suggest that growing confidence from long-term institutional buyers and potential policy clarity are key factors propelling the price upward. However, risks remain, including the U.S. Federal Reserve's potential for further interest rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey in Hungary, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is undertaking a massive preservation effort to save about 100,000 books from a severe beetle infestation. Restoration workers are removing the volumes to treat them in a nitrogen-filled, oxygen-free environment for six weeks to eradicate the pests, which feed on the gelatin and starch-based adhesives in the bookbindings. Library officials believe rising temperatures due to climate change may have exacerbated the infestation by allowing the beetles more life cycles annually. The project aims to protect centuries of irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.</p>

          <p>The biennial Talisman Sabre military exercise, the largest in its history, has commenced in Australia, involving over 35,000 personnel from 19 nations, including the U.S., Japan, Germany, and the U.K. For the first time, the drills extend beyond Australia to Papua New Guinea, demonstrating a broad international partnership. Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercises, a practice observed since 2017, but stated this would not disrupt the planned activities. The event showcases the strong defense alliance between Australia and the United States amid complex regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers are making substantial inroads in Norway, capturing approximately 10% of the market in what is considered Europe's most EV-friendly country. Brands like BYD, XPeng, and MG are competing effectively with established players like Tesla, benefiting from competitive pricing, advanced technology, and Norway's policy of not imposing tariffs on Chinese EVs. Analysts view Norway as a key entry point for these brands into the broader European market due to its high EV adoption rate and lack of a domestic auto industry. The trend signals a growing challenge for traditional Western automakers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June compared to the previous year, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating resilience in its trade sector. The growth was largely driven by a surge in shipments to Southeast Asian and European Union countries, which helped offset a continued, though moderated, decline in exports to the United States. A temporary tariff truce between the U.S. and China contributed to easing the drop in U.S.-bound trade. The data reflects Chinese exporters' ongoing efforts to diversify their markets in response to persistent trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>
