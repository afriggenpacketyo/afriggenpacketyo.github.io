        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 2025 Salzburg Festival's program is heavily influenced by contemporary global turmoil, with a focus on themes of power, conflict, and bloodshed. Artistic director Markus Hinterhäuser has curated a lineup of operas and plays that explore the crumbling authority of historical rulers, from Julius Caesar to Macbeth. The festival will also feature works by artists who have fled Putin's Russia, and a series of concerts honoring composer Dmitri Shostakovich. Despite a recent controversy over the dismissal of a Russian dramaturge, the event aims to use performance art to reflect on and provoke thought about current world events.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, causing its stock to rise over 6%. Despite a recent dip in North American demand, CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed confidence that strategic changes will spur a rebound in the coming quarters. The company is focusing on boosting its brands, embracing healthier snack trends, and implementing cost-cutting measures, including plant closures and more efficient logistics. PepsiCo reiterated its full-year outlook, projecting organic revenue growth at the low end of its 4% to 6% long-term goal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Government to Lower Voting Age to 16 and Expand Accepted Voter ID</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 10:28:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections across the United Kingdom, a change that will enfranchise approximately 1.5 million young people. The new legislation also includes measures to expand the list of acceptable voter identification to include bank cards and to move toward an automated voter registration system. These reforms represent the most significant change to the British electorate since 1969. The move has been welcomed by student groups but criticized by opposition parties for its timing and for not allowing 16-year-olds to stand as candidates.</p>

          <p>In a world-first clinical trial, eight healthy babies have been born in the U.K. using a pioneering IVF technique that incorporates DNA from three individuals. The method, known as mitochondrial donation, replaces the mother's faulty mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor to prevent the transmission of severe genetic diseases. The trial, conducted at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, successfully reduced the amount of mutated DNA in the babies by up to 100%. While hailed as a breakthrough, the procedure remains controversial and is not approved in many countries due to ethical concerns.</p>

          <p>Despite the growing popularity and inclusive atmosphere of women's soccer, many European national teams at Euro 2025 lack significant ethnic diversity compared to their male counterparts. Teams like England and Germany have squads that are predominantly white, not fully reflecting their countries' diverse populations. In contrast, the French team is noted for its diversity, which players attribute to a widespread, accessible club system. The issue highlights structural barriers to access for minority communities, prompting football associations and programs to launch new strategies aimed at boosting diversity at the grassroots level.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts do not expect home equity loan rates to decrease following the Federal Reserve's July meeting, citing persistent inflation and a strong jobs report. With the federal funds rate holding steady, the likelihood of a rate cut this month is considered very low. Lenders typically base their home equity loan rates on the Fed's decisions, so significant drops are unlikely until the central bank implements a cut, which markets suggest is more possible in September or later. Borrowers hoping for lower rates may need to wait, as lenders are holding firm on current offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

The experiment, launched aboard the Tianzhou-9 cargo craft, contains living human brain cells, immune cells, and capillary-like vessels on a credit-card-sized chip. This marks the first time such a highly integrated brain model with a blood-brain barrier has been studied in space. Researchers hope the findings will help develop preventative measures for cognitive issues experienced by astronauts during long-duration missions and advance neuroscience research.</p>
