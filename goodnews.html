          <p>USC's football team faces uncertainty regarding the availability of star wideout Ja’Kobi Lane and starting left tackle Elijah Paige for upcoming conference games. Lane returned to practice after an upper body injury, but Paige was absent. Coach Lincoln Riley declined to provide updates, referring to the Big Ten’s availability report. Their potential absence creates challenges, forcing other players into larger roles, though the offense demonstrated resilience in a recent win.</p>

          <p>Financial expert Dave Ramsey addressed a caller's dilemma about her retired father requesting monthly rental profits after previously selling her childhood home at a significantly reduced price. The daughter and her brother inherited the $1.3 million home for $450,000. Ramsey advised that while there's no moral obligation, giving a smaller amount might be reasonable given the past generosity, but cautioned against enabling a sibling. He emphasized setting clear boundaries in family money matters. (not investment advice)</p>

The article argues that the parade helps individuals connect with China's destiny, moving beyond a Western-centric view. It serves as a collective display that reinforces a deep sense of national identity, particularly for regions like Hong Kong and Macau, by emphasizing unity and strength in a fragmented global order.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his position on the war in Ukraine, now stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO. This change came after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, where Trump previously suggested territorial concessions. Trump, who labeled Russia a "paper tiger," also indicated the U.S. would continue supplying weapons to NATO for Ukraine. Zelenskyy welcomed this "big shift" as a positive signal.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has successfully disrupted a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which posed a significant threat to NYC's telecom systems and the UN General Assembly. Investigators found active SIM farms in abandoned buildings, containing over 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and disabling cell phone towers. The sophisticated, well-funded network was linked to foreign governments, organized crime, and human trafficking. No arrests have been made yet, but the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts Animal Testing Grants, Fuels Debate on Research Alternatives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, with major health agencies phasing out live animal research in favor of alternatives. This move, driven by a bipartisan coalition of animal rights activists and skeptical spending advocates, sparks fierce debate. While animal tests have been crucial for developing life-saving drugs, proponents of alternatives advocate for AI-based modeling and lab testing on human organs. However, experts caution that current alternative science is not yet ready to fully replace animal models for safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is developing a single Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) platform to replace both its C-17A Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo planes by the mid-2040s. The new aircraft aims for greater speed, operational flexibility, and enhanced defense against growing threats on the ground and in the air. While the C-17 and C-5 have distinct capabilities, the Air Force seeks a unified strategic airlift solution due to cost concerns for multiple new fleets. This initiative is part of a broader modernization effort to recapitalize aging assets on the Air Force's terms.</p>

          <p>Health experts worldwide are rejecting President Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s claims linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism. Organizations including the European Medicines Agency, UK's MHRA, and Australia's TGA affirm that current scientific evidence shows no causal link, and paracetamol remains a safe option for pain and fever in pregnant women. Spain's Health Minister criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, while the WHO noted inconsistent evidence. This collective rejection underscores a unified international medical consensus against the claims.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea academy graduate, has seized a first-team lifeline after a potential transfer to Fulham fell through. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George scored a crucial equalizer and assisted the winning goal in Chelsea's Carabao Cup victory against Lincoln City, preventing a potential upset. His impressive performance provides manager Enzo Maresca with a valuable attacking option, especially given other striker injuries. George's dedication, including extensive personal training, is helping him disrupt the typical Chelsea youth pathway and pursue first-team success.</p>

          <p>California is moving to regulate excessively loud commercials on streaming services, with Senate Bill 576 awaiting the governor's signature. The legislation, inspired by a new mother's experience with commercials disturbing her newborn, would prohibit streaming ads from being louder than the programming. While federal law already regulates broadcast and cable TV ad volume, streaming services were exempt. The Motion Picture Assn. and Streaming Innovation Alliance initially opposed the bill but became neutral after an amendment removed private lawsuit provisions, indicating progress towards consumer relief.</p>
