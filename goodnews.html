          <p>As the U.S. pulls back from global climate efforts, China has an opportunity to step up and lead the green transition. With extreme weather events causing significant damage in China, responding decisively to climate change is a matter of national resilience. China, already a leader in renewable energy deployment, can drive progress across political and economic divides by investing in clean energy and climate-smart initiatives. This leadership role is not only a duty but also in China's best interest, as it offers economic opportunities alongside environmental benefits.</p>

          <p>Prince William has described Sir David Attenborough as a significant inspiration for his new wildlife documentary series, Guardians, which highlights the work of rangers. The Prince of Wales hopes the series will showcase the beauty of the natural world and the importance of conservation, similar to Attenborough's documentaries. Guardians focuses on the increasingly dangerous work of rangers who protect endangered animals, with around 1,400 rangers having died in the past decade. The series aims to emphasize the value of these individuals and the need to support their efforts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will resume using horse-drawn caissons for funerals at Arlington National Cemetery in June, after suspending the practice in May 2023 due to horse deaths and injuries.

The Army enlisted equestrian expert David O'Connor to improve the program, focusing on education, animal welfare, and lighter equipment. The new program will involve two squads of horses performing two services a day, with extensive training for personnel and a focus on the horses' well-being.</p>

          <p>Dr. Maher Abdallah, director of American Reproductive Centers in Palm Springs, has vowed to rebuild his clinic after a bombing. The clinic was nearly destroyed by a targeted bomb explosion, but the in vitro fertilization lab remained intact, preserving thousands of frozen eggs, sperm, and embryos. The suspected bomber, Guy Edward Bartkus, held antinatalist views and was killed in the explosion. Abdallah has forgiven the suspect and is focusing on the future, with the clinic temporarily relocating to a surgical center and plans to rebuild on the same site.</p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, a painter who turned to bagel art and then became a toy designer, has died at 87. She started by selling necklaces strung with mini-bagels on a dare from her husband. After her daughter brought one of her bagel necklaces to school, where it was a hit, Mr. Blau dared his wife to show a bag of them to a Bloomingdale‚Äôs buyer. To her dismay, the store ordered 100. She also designed Sweetie Pops, dolls that preschoolers could dress themselves, with arms and legs that snapped on and off.</p>
