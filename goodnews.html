          <p>As Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates remain competitive but have fallen from recent peaks, experts advise savers on the best terms for maximum returns, particularly in September 2025. This article highlights that short-term CDs, especially six-month options, currently offer the biggest yields due to market uncertainty and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. While longer-term CDs can be part of a "CD laddering" strategy to lock in rates, the focus for maximizing immediate returns is on shorter durations. Savers are encouraged to balance liquidity needs with rate considerations and explore options like no-penalty CDs to meet financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi affirmed that India will not cut crude oil imports from Russia, signaling a commitment to deepen cooperation "in all sectors" despite pressure from the United States. This declaration followed a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is anticipated to visit India in December for their annual bilateral summit, a mechanism established in 2000. The geopolitical context includes reports of former U.S. President Trump canceling a planned visit to India, reportedly due to New Delhi's continued purchases of discounted Russian oil. This article highlights India's strategic balancing act in its foreign policy and energy security, navigating complex relationships with both Russia and the U.S.</p>

          <p>New trial data indicates that Novo Nordisk's weight management drug, Wegovy (semaglutide), significantly reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by 57% in individuals with obesity and cardiovascular disease, outperforming rival treatments. This positive finding provides a crucial boost for the Danish pharmaceutical giant, which has faced challenges in the U.S. market, including declining market share and increased competition. While a real-world study rather than a randomized control trial, the results add to growing evidence of Wegovy's specific heart-protective benefits, potentially making it a "game changer" and encouraging investor confidence despite prior struggles.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn that ultra-processed foods (UPFs) are a significant barrier to weight loss and are pervasive in nearly every meal, making healthier eating challenging. Recent research shows that overweight adults who cut out UPFs lost nearly twice as much weight as those who didn't. This article, drawing on advice from the Mayo Clinic and other sources, helps identify UPFs—which include not just obvious items like sugary cereals but also fortified foods and many common breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack items. Consumers are advised to look for ingredients not typically used in home kitchens and prioritize minimally processed foods, though some "better" UPFs can still aid weight loss if they prevent unhealthier choices.</p>

          <p>The All England Club has no plans to alter the format of its mixed doubles competition, despite the "reimagined" and highly successful event at the US Open that attracted top singles players and large crowds. Wimbledon officials consider the current setup a key part of the tournament, with doubles generally more appreciated there. This article highlights how Wimbledon's traditional stance, coupled with constraints like fragile grass courts and limited space, has seen it fall behind other Grand Slams in offering extended "fan week" events. The ongoing Wimbledon Park Project aims to address these issues by expanding grounds to host qualifying and pre-tournament activities on-site.</p>

          <p>The Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, shut down in 2020 for economic reasons, is planning to restart operations by 2028, becoming the third U.S. mothballed reactor to do so. This revival is primarily driven by the surging electricity demand from new artificial intelligence data centers, with NextEra Energy aiming to secure lucrative power purchase agreements, similar to Microsoft's support for the Three Mile Island restart. This article highlights the "unicorn opportunities" of restarting existing plants over new construction, bringing over 600 megawatts back to the grid. The project, while capital-intensive and subject to supply chain constraints, represents a significant shift back towards high-capacity nuclear power amidst changing energy market dynamics and a focus on reliable, clean energy sources.</p>

          <p>California, a leader in EV adoption, is underutilizing its solar energy surplus by predominantly charging electric vehicles overnight, which relies on natural gas. This article advocates for shifting EV charging to midday at workplaces, where the grid is flush with solar power, potentially cutting emissions by an additional 80%. Research from UC San Diego's large-scale workplace charging experiment shows that informing drivers about these benefits can slightly shift behavior. The article emphasizes the need for stronger incentives, such as electricity pricing reflecting real-time generation costs, and improved quality and expansion of workplace charging networks to efficiently utilize clean, cheap midday energy and address the state's significant energy challenge.</p>
