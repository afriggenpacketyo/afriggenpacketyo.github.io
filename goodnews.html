          <p>Rabbi Pinchas Taylor of the American Faith Coalition paid tribute to the late Charlie Kirk, highlighting his deep faith and unwavering support for the Jewish people and Israel. In his remarks, Taylor described Kirk not just as a political commentator but as a man of conviction who stood against antisemitism and acted as a voice of reason within his political circles. The tribute contextualizes Kirk's legacy as a bridge-builder between communities, guided by Judeo-Christian values, ahead of a large memorial service.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match, securing a 2-0 victory in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, played a pivotal role with a half-century knock of 55 runs, guiding England to their target of 155 with 17 balls to spare. England's spin bowlers were also effective, taking six of the eight Irish wickets to restrict the hosts' total.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, calling it the start of a "fight back to rescue this street." The event is a precursor to a potential permanent pedestrianization aimed at increasing footfall and boosting business for one of the world's busiest shopping areas. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, concerns remain over accessibility for those with mobility issues and the displacement of traffic to smaller residential streets.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former director of the National Economic Council, provided analysis on the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, noting that the central bank is projecting two additional cuts this year. He clarified that the Fed's actions primarily impact overnight bank lending rates and do not automatically lower consumer borrowing costs for things like mortgages or auto loans. Cohn also pointed to the Fed's acknowledgment of a cooling labor market, as companies reduce their workforce to protect profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can physically accelerate the aging process by damaging telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. This cellular damage can be counteracted by adopting an "anti-inflammatory lifestyle" focused on stress management. Epel recommends incorporating small, sustainable habits like eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short daily breaks for meditation, and prioritizing deep rest through activities such as yoga or breathwork to promote longevity.</p>

He argues that consumers should avoid two common mistakes: choosing no-fee cards, which generally offer poor rewards, and hoarding points, which can be devalued by the issuer at any time. Instead, users should select cards that match their spending habits and periodically call their card company's retention department to negotiate for offers that can offset the annual fee.
