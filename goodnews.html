          <h2>Tokyo to Waive Water Fees to Combat Summer Heat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to encourage residents to use air conditioning without financial burden during increasingly hot summers, Tokyo will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months. The supplementary budget bill, including 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) to cover the costs, will be submitted to the Tokyo metropolitan assembly session in June. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the goal is to protect residents' lives and daily living amid declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. Approximately 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving about 5,000 yen on water bills over the four months, though metered usage will still be charged.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in Kannada to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' which explores the hardships of Muslim women in southern India. The stories, translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, who shares the ¬£50,000 prize, were praised for their astonishing portraits of survival and resilience. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges the women in her stories face, brought on by religious conservatism and patriarchal society. The book highlights the value of attention to lives lived at the edges and the strength it takes to persist.</p>

          <p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is scheduled to meet with Donald Trump at the White House in an effort to address strained relations between the two countries. The U.S. administration has criticized Pretoria's policies, including claims of persecution against white Afrikaner farmers, and has taken actions such as cutting aid and expelling South Africa's ambassador. Ramaphosa aims to correct Trump's misconceptions about race relations and his government's policies. A vital free trade agreement hangs in the balance, making the meeting crucial for South Africa's economic interests.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he had never bought rice due to receiving it from supporters, a comment that came amidst a national rice shortage and soaring prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba accepted Eto's resignation and appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister to address the situation. The comment drew attention to the government's inability to resolve the rice shortage, which has driven up the cost of a staple food for Japanese households, despite the release of rice from government stockpiles.</p>

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. Japan also reported a trade deficit of 115.85 billion yen in April, marking the first deficit in three months, as export growth failed to offset imports. Despite a decline in U.S.-bound shipments, a Finance Ministry official stated that there was no clear impact of President Donald Trump's higher tariffs in the month's data.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives, following public criticism and government intervention. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, but Downing Street stated that rewarding themselves for failure is unacceptable. The decision comes after discussions with the regulator Ofwat, who may implement new rules to prevent water firms from handing out bonuses.

The test, developed by Fujirebio Holdings, will initially be available at about 50 American research institutes and hospitals. It is designed to detect amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals at least 55 years old exhibiting signs of the disease. The blood test is viewed as a critical step in making new Alzheimer's treatments widely accessible and is expected to be more affordable and less invasive than current methods.</p>
