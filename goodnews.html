          <p>The startup Beewise is utilizing artificial intelligence and robotics to protect bee colonies from threats like climate change and pesticides, which cause 40% of colonies to collapse annually. Their "BeeHome" product is a robotic beehive that uses cameras and AI to monitor bee health, automatically dispensing food, medicine, and regulating temperature to ensure colony survival. This technology aims to replace traditional wooden hives by offering a more protective environment that has been shown to reduce bee colony loss by 70%. The innovation is crucial for protecting the pollinators responsible for over a third of global food crops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Swedish study has revealed that a low dose of aspirin can significantly reduce the recurrence of colorectal cancer by 55% in patients with a specific genetic mutation. Researchers followed over 3,500 patients who had undergone surgery, giving half a daily 160mg dose of aspirin and the other half a placebo. The positive effect was observed in patients whose tumors had a mutation in the PIK3CA signaling pathway, which is present in about a third of all colorectal cancer cases. The findings suggest that this inexpensive, widely available medication could become a key part of post-operative care for a large subset of cancer survivors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration faced two significant legal setbacks regarding its immigration policies, as federal judges blocked the deportation of Guatemalan children and protected Venezuelans. A judge in Washington D.C. criticized the administration for attempting to deport 76 unaccompanied Guatemalan minors, halting the process while a legal challenge proceeds. In a separate case, a federal appeals court upheld a ruling that prevents the administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. These rulings represent a judicial check on the executive branch's recent aggressive deportation efforts.</p>

The company, which launched its AI assistant just before the generative AI boom, reports that over 50% of its customers are now paying for AI add-ons. To further capitalize on this trend, Notion has launched a new customizable AI agent capable of creating documents and pulling data from various sources. Despite its rapid growth, the company faces significant competition from giants like Microsoft and Google in the crowded productivity software market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A joint press conference between U.S. President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer revealed areas of both agreement and divergence on major international issues. Trump acknowledged a disagreement over the UK's plan to recognize Palestinian statehood but downplayed it, while Starmer worked to reassure him about the UK's stance on Hamas. Both leaders presented a united front on defense spending and criticized Russia's Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine. The discussion also touched on trade tariffs and Starmer's defense of the UK's Online Safety Act, showcasing a complex but managed diplomatic exchange.</p>

          <p>During his state visit to the U.K., President Donald Trump suggested that "good news" regarding the Russia-Ukraine war could be forthcoming, expressing a personal obligation to end the long-running conflict. Speaking alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump also voiced his disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating that Putin had "really let me down" by failing to engage with peace efforts. Despite having previously claimed he could end the war in a single day, Trump admitted the conflict has been more difficult to resolve than he anticipated, even as he touted his administration's success in settling other global conflicts.</p>

          <p>Google is making its Gemini artificial intelligence a standard feature in the Chrome browser for users in the U.S., intensifying its competition with AI-native search platforms like Perplexity. This integration will allow users to interact with Gemini to understand webpage content, manage tasks across tabs, and access Google apps like Calendar and Maps without leaving their current page. The company also announced upcoming "agentic" capabilities, which will enable Gemini to perform multi-step tasks like booking appointments or ordering groceries. This move signals a major shift for the browser, evolving it from a gateway to the web into an interactive, AI-powered assistant.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years, offering potential relief for prospective homebuyers. This decline occurred just before the Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point cut to its benchmark interest rate, suggesting that borrowing costs could continue to fall. Analysts are watching key economic indicators, such as upcoming unemployment and inflation reports, as signs of a cooling economy could prompt further rate cuts from the Fed. This trend could create a more favorable market for buyers who have been sidelined by previously high rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A wave of Gen Z-led protests is challenging established political orders in several Asian countries, including Nepal, Indonesia, and Bangladesh, drawing comparisons to the Arab Spring. These digitally-native activists are mobilizing against corruption, authoritarianism, and economic inequality, successfully toppling governments in some cases, as seen with the recent resignation of Bangladesh's prime minister. While social media has been a powerful tool for organizing these decentralized movements, experts remain cautiously optimistic about their long-term impact. The key challenge will be translating street-level activism into institutional reforms to ensure lasting change.</p>

          <p>In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, female equestrian teams across the U.S. are keeping a vibrant Mexican tradition alive through the sport of escaramuza. The performances feature eight women in traditional "adelita" dresses riding sidesaddle in synchronized, elegant routines set to mariachi music, a practice passed down through generations. Originating from the role women played in the Mexican Revolution, the sport requires a deep bond between rider and horse, as well as exceptional skill. For participants, it is a powerful way to maintain a connection to their cultural roots and showcase a lesser-known aspect of Mexican rodeo.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut will have a mixed but noticeable impact on American consumers' finances. Borrowers with variable-rate products like home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are expected to see immediate relief with lower monthly payments. While mortgage rates have already declined in anticipation of the move, the impact on high credit card APRs will likely be minimal. Conversely, savers may see reduced returns, as yields on high-interest savings accounts and CDs are expected to drop from their recent highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has changed its martial law policy to allow men aged 18 to 22 to leave and re-enter the country freely. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes this freedom of movement will encourage young men to remain based in Ukraine rather than leaving permanently to avoid mobilization, which begins at age 25. The decision has sparked a debate within Ukrainian society, with some viewing it as a positive step for personal freedom and others seeing it as unfair to older citizens and active soldiers. Border officials have not yet seen a significant surge in departures, attributing current traffic to the summer season.</p>
