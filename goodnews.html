          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions at an ICE detention facility in Manhattan. The ruling prohibits the use of the facility unless the number of detainees is reduced and essential items like sleeping mats, soap, and toothpaste are provided. This decision followed a lawsuit by the ACLU and other advocates, who presented video evidence of "inhumane" conditions, including detainees sleeping on the floor. The government has denied the allegations of substandard conditions and plans to appeal the order.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the considerations for investing in annuities amid the current economic landscape of elevated interest rates and persistent inflation. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates in the near future, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher annuity payouts, which offer a reliable lifetime income stream. The ideal percentage of a portfolio to allocate to annuities varies based on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, but experts often suggest a range of 20% to 50%. The decision requires balancing the need for guaranteed income against the desire for investment growth and flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major pornography websites have seen a significant drop in UK-based traffic since new age verification rules under the Online Safety Act were enforced on July 25. Data from analytics firm Similarweb shows that top sites like Pornhub and XVideos experienced a 47% decrease in traffic, with Pornhub losing over a million daily visitors in two weeks. The new law requires sites to implement stricter age checks to prevent minors from accessing explicit content. However, data also suggests a corresponding rise in visits to smaller, less-regulated sites and a surge in VPN app downloads, which can circumvent the new rules.</p>

          <p>Amazon has significantly expanded its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, eggs, and produce in more than 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The company plans to extend the service to at least 2,300 locations by the end of the year, intensifying its competition with rivals like Instacart and Walmart. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, and Amazon stated that initial testing showed the offering attracted new grocery customers who then shopped more frequently. This move is part of Amazon's broader strategy to overhaul its grocery business and integrate it more closely with its primary retail platform.</p>

          <p>FEWS NET, the U.S. government's Famine Early Warning System Network, is being brought back online after its operations were abruptly stopped by the Trump administration in January. Created in 1985 in response to the Ethiopian famine, the system uses data to predict hunger hot spots up to eight months in advance, allowing aid organizations to prevent food crises. The shutdown created a critical information gap for humanitarian groups worldwide. While the relaunch is seen as a positive step, food security experts remain cautious, questioning the future quality and scope of the system and whether its warnings will be acted upon.</p>

          <p>Alcohol consumption among American adults has fallen to its lowest point on record, according to a new Gallup survey. The poll found that 54% of Americans report drinking alcohol, down from 62% in 2023. For the first time, a majority of respondents (53%) now view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health, a significant shift in public perception. This trend is also reflected in drinking frequency, with the average number of drinks per week dropping to 2.8, the lowest since 1996. The decline does not appear to be driven by a shift to other substances like recreational cannabis.</p>

          <h2>German Player in New Canadian Soccer League Sees It as a Model for Europe</h2>

          <p>German defender Lara Schenk, now playing for the Montreal Roses in Canada's new Northern Super League (NSL), believes European leagues can learn from the new North American venture. Schenk highlights the professional structures of the NSL, which allow players to focus entirely on soccer. The league, co-founded by former Canadian international Diana Matheson, was built with strong player-centric provisions like extended maternity leave and a ban on non-consensual transfers. Schenk argues that for women's soccer to grow in Europe, particularly in smaller leagues, similar standards for contracts, minimum wages, and professional conditions must be established.</p>
