          <p>A zoo in the Czech Republic has announced the birth of four Barbary lion cubs, a subspecies that has been extinct in the wild for decades. The birth is a significant achievement for an international endangered species program aimed at preserving the breed's genetic diversity in captivity. While the cubs will eventually be sent to other parks, the long-term vision is to potentially reintroduce the majestic lions to their native habitat in the Atlas Mountains of North Africa, a complex but hopeful goal for conservationists.</p>
