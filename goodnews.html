        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France is leading a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink service, though experts remain skeptical about its ability to compete on a mass-market scale. With a recent ‚Ç¨1.35 billion state-led investment, France has become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, viewing the company as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation of 650 low-Earth orbit satellites is significantly smaller than Starlink's 7,600, posing a major challenge in capacity and coverage. Analysts suggest Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize European control over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings during a game against the Kansas City Royals. In his third start since returning from elbow surgery, he recorded the fastest pitch of his MLB career, a four-seam fastball clocked at 101.7 miles per hour. While his pitching was a highlight, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, striking out three times. Despite his strong performance on the mound, the Dodgers' five-game winning streak came to an end with a 9-5 loss to the Royals.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in public spaces, including all beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, which went into effect on Sunday. The rules are designed to protect non-smokers, especially children, from the effects of passive smoking and are part of a broader government goal to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While e-cigarettes are not included and restaurant terraces are exempt, violators of the new ban could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700. The move comes as France, despite declining rates, still has one of the higher smoking populations in Europe, with over 30% of adults smoking.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale Pride parades, marking the culmination of a month of LGBTQ+ celebrations with a notably defiant and political tone. Organizers state this year's events emphasize protest more than in recent years, responding to a wave of policies targeting LGBTQ+ rights, particularly those affecting transgender individuals. The theme for New York's march is "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," reflecting the community's response to the challenging political climate. The events also face new headwinds from a reduction in corporate sponsorships, with major companies like PepsiCo and Nissan pulling back their support.</p>

          <p>President Trump's major domestic policy package, dubbed the "big, beautiful bill," narrowly cleared a key procedural hurdle in the Senate after a dramatic late-night vote. Republican leadership overcame resistance from a small group of conservative holdouts, including Senators Mike Lee and Ron Johnson, who had concerns about the bill's spending levels and impact on the deficit. The 51-49 vote allows the Senate to proceed to a final debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill. Democrats are employing delay tactics, ensuring the contentious legislative process will continue as leaders push to meet a July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new voluntary partnership with major food retailers and manufacturers in England to encourage healthier eating habits and tackle rising obesity rates. Under the plan, businesses will be asked to find ways to make healthy food more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or in-store layout changes. While the initiative requires retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability, it does not impose specific targets. The policy is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and relieve pressure on the NHS, as official figures show obesity affects over one in five children by the time they leave primary school.</p>

The initiative, trialed during a recent Tokyo championship, aims to foster a stronger team spirit and help younger athletes adapt to high-pressure international events.

          <p>A new pilot program in primary schools across Kent, UK, is teaching children as young as five about sun safety in an effort to reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, charities and health professionals behind the project hope that instilling good habits early can help "grow skin cancer out of the next generation."</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive celebration of human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The government had attempted to ban the march using a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, used a legal loophole to ensure it proceeded. The huge turnout, far exceeding last year's, was seen by many as a direct response to the government's ban attempt. The event transformed from a traditional Pride parade into a broader demonstration for freedom and solidarity against Orban's populist rule.</p>
