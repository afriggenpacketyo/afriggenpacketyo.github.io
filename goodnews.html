        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Juan Soto delivered a crucial two-run double in the fourth inning, leading the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked pitching staff was a key factor in the game, with starter Tony Gonsolin struggling with command after a solid start. Gonsolin's difficulty in the fourth inning, marked by consecutive walks, set the stage for Soto's decisive hit. Mets starter David Peterson pitched effectively, contributing to the Dodgers' reliance on their bullpen, which had been heavily used in previous games. </p>

By fostering dialogue and promoting balanced economic policies, Hong Kong can contribute to a more stable and equitable global order. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to improve working conditions for chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions by increasing their annual salaries to over 6 million yen ($41,000), up from the current average of 4 to 4.5 million yen. This initiative aims to attract and retain talented chefs amidst growing global competition as Japanese cuisine gains popularity. The government will also allow chefs to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government, rather than serving as live-in chefs. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role of chefs in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, referring to them as "food diplomats."</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, died at 90, leaving behind a legacy that transformed societal views on sexual assault. Her groundbreaking book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault‚Äù challenged the notion of sexual assault as an act of passion, reframing it as a crime of power and violence. The book, which provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault, influenced the women's movement, leading to the establishment of sexual assault crisis centers and the reform of laws to facilitate the prosecution of perpetrators. Despite facing criticism for some of her views, Brownmiller remained a significant figure in the fight against sexual assault.</p>
