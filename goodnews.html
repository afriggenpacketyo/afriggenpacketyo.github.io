          <p>Linebacker Micah Parsons made an impactful debut with the Green Bay Packers, securing his first sack for the team in a 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The play, which occurred in the fourth quarter against quarterback Jared Goff, was a key moment in a strong defensive performance by the Packers. The trade and Parsons' subsequent success prompted a reaction of disbelief on social media from his former Dallas Cowboys teammate, cornerback Trevon Diggs. The two players are scheduled to face each other in Week 4 of the season.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly urged Hamas to accept a new ceasefire proposal, stating it is his "last warning" for the group to agree to a deal. The proposed terms, reportedly put forth by Trump, would involve Hamas releasing its remaining hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and negotiations to end the war. Hamas has acknowledged receiving ideas from the U.S. via mediators and stated its readiness for negotiations contingent on a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. An Israeli official confirmed that the proposal is being seriously considered.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman experienced the shock of a lifetime when she unexpectedly gave birth in a toilet at a football club in Lowestoft, Suffolk, having had no idea she was pregnant. Charlotte Robinson said she felt no movement and experienced no unusual symptoms leading up to the birth of her son, Henry. This phenomenon, known as a cryptic pregnancy, affects approximately one in 2,500 births. An off-duty paramedic assisted at the scene until an ambulance arrived, and both mother and baby are reportedly healthy following the surprise arrival.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a bad back that limited his preseason activity, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 victory over the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history to surpass 60,000 career passing yards. The Rams' defense sealed the win in the final minutes when linebacker Nate Landman forced a crucial fumble that was recovered by Braden Fiske. The victory marked a positive start for the Rams after a season opener that was sloppy at times.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of couples are maintaining happy and committed marriages while living in separate homes, sometimes even in different countries. This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), is chosen by a small but notable percentage of married people to preserve independence and pursue separate career goals. One woman shared her story of moving from Australia to London for her career while her husband remained, strengthening their relationship through regular communication. Experts note that for some, this structure can provide beneficial space and help maintain a strong sense of individual identity within the marriage.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation ahead of its 2026 centennial. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland as he watched his daughters ride it, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining four-across wooden carousels of its kind. Although it requires significant repairs before reopening, the acquisition is seen as a key part of a broader park restoration project.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities and increasing capital allocation to Asia, driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector and expectations of looser U.S. monetary policy. According to Bank of America research, this marks a significant shift after a decade of U.S. market dominance, which attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024. A weakening U.S. dollar and more attractive valuations in Asia are contributing to the trend, with the global AI market expected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a significant portion deployed in the Asia-Pacific region.

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a stunning "Blood Moon," visible to stargazers across Asia and parts of Europe and Africa. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a deep reddish hue. This coloring is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and reflect off the moon. The event was best viewed in Asia, including India and China, while observers in the Americas missed the spectacle.</p>

          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. In an interview, he stated that the Asian region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its successful integration into the global economy. Goldin noted that while the process is becoming more fragmented, with the U.S. partially withdrawing, Asia continues to thrive. He also cautioned that the benefits of globalisation are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also global in nature.</p>

          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer argues that while President Trump dominates media headlines, his actions have not been a lucrative focus for stock market investors. He contends that the recent weak jobs report, showing a significant slowdown in payroll growth, can be attributed in part to the administration's policies, such as the Department of Government Efficiency's workforce reductions. However, Cramer concludes that for stock picking, the president's influence on the economy is largely irrelevant compared to fundamental business performance, suggesting investors are better off analyzing company conference calls than political rhetoric.

To capitalize on this momentum, the author suggests that Beijing should encourage more foreign dignitaries to visit and support the establishment of more international institutions in the city.

While Southern California may welcome the relief from recent heat waves, the Bay Area is facing more chilly weather after an already cold summer. The cooling is caused by an upper-level low-pressure system moving in from the Pacific, bringing a thick marine layer, drizzle, and even scattered showers to some areas. This pattern is unusual for early September, which is typically one of the warmest periods for coastal California.</p>
