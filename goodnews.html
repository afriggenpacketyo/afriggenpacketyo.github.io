          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe addressed Alexander Isak's £125m transfer to Liverpool, acknowledging a shift in their relationship after Isak went on "strike" to force the move. Howe emphasized his initial positive relationship with Isak and the mutual benefits both parties experienced during his time at Newcastle. Howe expressed his disappointment at Isak's change in attitude once Liverpool expressed interest, and reiterated the club's desire to retain its key players. The manager also noted Newcastle's recruitment of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa to bolster their attacking options amid striker shortages.</p>

          <p>Following recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace, German politicians are urging increased investment in air defenses for the Bundeswehr. SPD spokesperson Siemtje Möller emphasized the urgent need to expand air defense capabilities, particularly anti-drone systems like the Skyranger. CDU state premier Boris Rhein echoed this sentiment, calling for a German defense guarantee and investment in combat drones. The article also mentions the Bundesliga's return after the international break, with Bayer Leverkusen seeking a fresh start under new coach Kasper Hjulmand after a disappointing season start.</p>

          <p>A growing number of NFL and UFC athletes are exploring ibogaine, a psychedelic substance, to treat traumatic brain injury, despite its Schedule 1 drug status in the US. An observational study on veterans indicated ibogaine's potential in reducing anxiety, depression, and cognitive challenges associated with TBI. While athletes like Robert Gallery and Tait Fletcher credit ibogaine with improving their mental health, experts emphasize the need for further research and medical supervision due to potential heart problems. Several states are pushing for clinical research into ibogaine, inspired by the positive results seen in veterans.</p>

          <p>Despite being a densely populated urban environment, New York City offers surprising refuge for monarch butterflies, a species facing population declines nationwide. The city's parks, gardens, and even small patches of green space provide essential milkweed plants for monarch caterpillars and pesticide-free wildflowers for adult butterflies. Efforts by city gardeners, naturalists, and even "guerilla gardeners" to plant native species are contributing to the conservation of monarchs in the urban landscape. These efforts demonstrate that even small-scale habitat restoration can have a significant impact on wildlife conservation in urban areas.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that the U.S. will equally share profits with Japan from projects funded by the Asian country's $550 billion investment through its tariff deal until the investment is recouped. After Japan earns back its initial investment, the profit split will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. An investment committee will suggest projects for funding, requiring Trump's approval, and Japan will need to borrow money to fund the projects. Lutnick argues that the deal is beneficial for both countries, supporting domestic manufacturing in the U.S. and offering lower tariff rates for Japanese consumers (not investment advice).</p>
