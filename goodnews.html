          <p>Mark Cuban, along with Steve Cannon and Rashaun Williams, has launched Harbinger Sports Partners (HSP), a $750 million private equity fund focused on acquiring minority stakes in professional sports franchises across U.S. leagues. HSP will utilize a data-driven approach to identify undervalued sports assets, targeting positions between 1% and 5% in 92 franchises, with deal sizes ranging from $50 million to $150 million. The move comes as professional sports valuations surge and leagues increasingly open to private equity investment. Cuban, who sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks in 2023, retains a 27% minority stake and will leverage his experience in sports and business to guide HSP's investments and liquidity planning for portfolio teams.</p>

The activists were arrested near the airport's perimeter fence with angle grinders, glue, and other tools, intending to cut through the fence and attach themselves to a taxiway. Judge Hannah Duncan acknowledged that the activists caused no "actual harm" or disruption but criticized them for showing "no remorse" and treating their trial as an "extension of the protest," delaying proceedings and wasting court resources.</p>

          <p>A vote on a megabill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to opposition from Republican hard-liners, who complained that the bulk of the savings in the legislation would not take effect until after Trump leaves office.
