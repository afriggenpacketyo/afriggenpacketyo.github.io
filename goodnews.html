          <h2>Debanking Practices Spark Political Debate Amidst Claims of Discrimination</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 19:02:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious issue known as "debanking," where financial institutions close accounts or deny services based on perceived political positions, is gaining traction in Washington. While some view it as politically motivated discrimination, others argue it's simply banks exercising discretion to manage risk and profitability. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the issue, including reviving a "fair access" rule that would require large banks to provide services more broadly. Despite differing viewpoints, there's growing consensus that debanking is a problem needing serious attention, but what to do about it remains hotly debated. </p>

With the GOP holding a slim margin in the House Budget Committee, the loss of even a few votes could prevent the bill from advancing. House Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to sway the holdouts, while House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington remains confident the bill will pass. The effort to pass this bill is a crucial test of Johnson's speakership as he works to unify his divided conference. </p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that President Trump's tariffs would soon lead to price increases. CEO Doug McMillon stated that while the company would try to keep prices low, the magnitude of the tariffs made it impossible to absorb all the pressure. The retailer's shares fell initially before recovering, reflecting investor concerns about the impact of trade wars on the retail sector. While Walmart is better positioned than some competitors due to its domestic sourcing, higher prices are still expected for discretionary items. </p>

          <p>Walmart reported earnings that beat estimates, but the company's CFO warned that price hikes from tariffs could start later this month. Despite a recent agreement to lower duties on imports from China to 30% for 90 days, Walmart's CFO John David Rainey said tariffs are "still too high" and that it is "more than any retailer can absorb." Walmart expects net sales to increase 3.5% to 4.5% for the fiscal second quarter, but declined to provide guidance for earnings per share or operating income growth because of fluctuating U.S. tariff policy. </p>
