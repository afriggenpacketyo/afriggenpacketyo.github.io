          <p>A Broward County, Florida, circuit court judge, Gary Farmer, has been suspended without pay after an advisory panel found him unfit due to inappropriate jokes, bias, and poor attendance. The investigation revealed instances where Farmer made remarks considered offensive, including mocking a defendant expecting multiple children and referencing an "In Living Color" comedy sketch making fun of gay people. Farmer's attorney admitted he made the jokes to lighten tension but acknowledged they were inappropriate. The Florida Supreme Court's commission suspended Farmer following the recommendation from the FJQC.</p>

          <p>Rosa Chang, a Korean-born artist, is teaching Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) students the art of indigo and natural dyes, a centuries-old tradition. Her class, "Mindful Colors: Natural Dyes from Korea and Beyond," explores the relationship between color and nature, using plants like indigo and marigold to create various hues. Chang became involved in natural dyes after growing tired of the fashion industry's toxic fabrics. Students appreciate learning about the historical process and sustainability of natural dyes, which they plan to incorporate into their art or hobbies. Chang's children's book, "My Indigo World," shares the science and history behind Korean indigo dye.</p>

Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) checked the power lines and sent bird carcasses for evaluation. The Department of Fish and Wildlife determined that the birds were not electrocuted but showed injuries consistent with trauma, suggesting the use of a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot.

Business leaders and hotel owners expressed concerns that the wage increases will lead to job losses and deter future investments in the city.

This decision comes as Congress considers a bill that would penalize states providing healthcare to undocumented immigrants.
