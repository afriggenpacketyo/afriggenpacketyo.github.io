          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, largely due to receiving the most fan votes by a significant margin. However, a breakdown of the voting revealed a stark contrast in perception among her colleagues, who ranked her as only the ninth-best guard in the league. While fan votes account for 50% of the total, her low player ranking is notable, with some speculating it could be due to her missing several games this season or contentious on-court moments. Despite the peer ranking, Clark will captain a team at the All-Star game in her home arena.</p>

          <p>A booming coffee culture in China, traditionally a tea-drinking nation, is now expanding into the countryside, leading to a surge in rural and suburban cafes. This trend is fueled by a growing domestic market, which is now valued at around $42 billion, and a desire for unique, social-media-friendly experiences outside of cities. China's net coffee imports have grown over six-fold since 2020, reflecting a significant shift in consumer habits. However, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this influencer-driven cafe boom, noting that the novelty for customers can fade quickly after a single visit.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves at the start of NBA free agency, losing a key defensive player but quickly signing a new forward. Dorian Finney-Smith, a versatile defender, has reportedly agreed to a four-year, $53-million contract with the Houston Rockets after opting out of his deal with the Lakers. In response, the Lakers secured forward Jake LaRavia on a two-year, $12-million agreement. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing player, averaged 6.9 points last season and is noted for his strong three-point shooting, which the team hopes will help fill the void left by Finney-Smith's departure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a "landmark" review of the country's parental leave and pay policies for the first time in decades. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave to modernize a system that campaigners and a parliamentary committee have described as flawed and outdated. Critics point out that the UK's statutory paternity leave is among the least generous in Europe and that uptake of shared leave is very low, often because families cannot afford it. The goal is to create a system that better supports working families, though some express concern about placing additional cost burdens on employers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that a new wave of younger investors is significantly shaping market dynamics by investing in companies with bold, forward-looking ideas rather than established players focused on stock buybacks. He points to the performance of stocks like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash as examples of this trend, arguing these investors are less concerned with Federal Reserve policies and more focused on individual company narratives and growth potential. Cramer posits that the market is currently dominated by these "idea" and "story" driven investments, representing a shift away from traditional, institution-led market behavior.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not yet seen significant price increases for consumers resulting from U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. In an interview, Jassy explained that both Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the impact by making forward purchases and deploying inventory before the tariffs took full effect. He also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with its two million sellers, helps keep prices stable. Jassy also discussed the transformative potential of generative AI, stating that it will make employees' jobs more interesting and that most consumers may have robots in their homes within a decade.</p>

          <p>Energy bills for 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to decrease by about 7% starting Tuesday, as determined by the regulator Ofgem's latest price cap. This translates to a reduction of roughly ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. With ongoing uncertainty in global markets, there are concerns that bills could rise again during the winter. Ofgem is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which are now more widely available and could offer more price certainty.</p>

The court rejected a legal challenge that argued the governor had overstepped his authority by enacting the law in 2020 after the local parliament had voted it down. The law was originally introduced to comply with a court ruling that same-sex couples were entitled to legal protections equivalent to marriage. LGBTQ+ rights campaigners have hailed the decision as a significant victory that could positively influence similar legal battles in other British overseas territories.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed film producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list" after he paid $630,000 to settle a long-standing judgment. The payment resolves a dispute from 2019 over unpaid compensation and health benefits owed to four writers who worked on a proposed television show that never materialized. Being on the WGA's list effectively prevented guild members from working with Emmett. He stated that while the debt was tied to a defunct company, he made the personal decision to pay it because it was "the right thing to do," clearing the way for him to work with WGA writers on future projects.</p>
