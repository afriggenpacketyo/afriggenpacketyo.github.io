          <p>U.S. citizen Amir Amiry, who was wrongfully detained in Afghanistan for nine months, has been released following successful negotiations. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Donald Trump's leadership and Qatar's "tireless diplomatic efforts" for securing Amiry's return. This marks the fifth release of an American from Afghanistan this year, though other U.S. citizens remain unjustly detained. The administration hopes an executive order will deter wrongful detentions, with special envoy Adam Boehler personally overseeing Amiry's release.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer contends that the current AI boom and data center buildout are not analogous to the dot-com bubble of 2000, despite skeptics' comparisons. He argues that today's massive capital projects are undertaken by established, financially robust companies like Meta, Tesla, and Google, not debt-laden startups. While acknowledging some AI applications are still developing, Cramer highlights strong demand for AI services and infrastructure from major tech players, viewing it as a necessity for continued dominance rather than a speculative bubble.
