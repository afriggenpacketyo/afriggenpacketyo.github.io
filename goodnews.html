          <p>A shooting occurred at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulting in one person injured and the death of the suspect. According to Chief Ryan Strong, the suspect, a 31-year-old man, arrived at the church and began firing a long gun and handgun. A parishioner struck the suspect with a vehicle, and two staff members returned fire, killing him. One staff member, a security guard, was shot in the leg and is being treated at a hospital; the FBI is assisting with the investigation as authorities work to determine the motive behind the shooting. Optimism cannot be reflected in the fact that people survived the shooting.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may loan new pandas to Japan during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to stabilize relations amidst escalating tensions with the United States. The panda has historically served as a symbol of friendship between the two countries, and a new loan could signal improved relations, especially after China's ban on Japanese seafood imports. However, China's upcoming anniversary of its victory against Japanese aggression may present diplomatic challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a parenting expert suggests that parents can foster cooperation by avoiding threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, using language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries can be more effective. The expert recommends replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations, and shifting from threats to giving children agency over their behavior. This approach aims to create a safe and respectful environment where children feel heard and understood, leading to better self-regulation and emotional resilience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, is now available through GPs in England for individuals meeting strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to ensure those most in need can access the drug while managing GP workloads and NHS resources. Eligible patients include those with a BMI of 40 or higher, along with specific health conditions, and will receive wrap-around care, including exercise and diet support. The long-term plan is for the jabs to be more widely available, but supply concerns remain, and some GP practices are warning patients not meeting the criteria to avoid booking appointments.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country being electric. Government subsidies and long-term planning have been key to this dominance, with Beijing spending an estimated $231 billion to develop the EV industry. Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market, and the country has built the world's largest public charging network. While Western countries view China's approach as unfair business practice, Chinese EV executives argue that all companies have access to the same resources, fostering competition and innovation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is proposing to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, potentially as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is primarily an anesthetic, it has shown promise in treating treatment-resistant depression, though it is not yet licensed for routine use. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine later this year, and experts emphasize the importance of controlled clinical settings and lower doses compared to recreational use.</p>

This marks the first time the Bellingham brothers have scored in the same competition and the first time two siblings have scored at the same Club World Cup.

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack is blaming fearmongering for hospital staff's reluctance to provide the necessary drugs to end her ectopic pregnancy. Cammack, who opposes abortion, went to the emergency room five weeks into an ectopic pregnancy, where doctors determined she needed methotrexate. Due to Florida‚Äôs six-week abortion ban, medical staff were concerned about legal repercussions, delaying her treatment. Cammack hopes that going public with her experience will help opposing political groups find common ground, emphasizing that she would fight for any woman to receive care in similar situations.</p>
