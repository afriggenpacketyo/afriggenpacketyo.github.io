          <p>A U.S. federal judge issued a temporary restraining order preventing the government from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The emergency ruling came just as flights were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following a lawsuit by attorneys who argued the plan would violate legal protections for vulnerable minors. The judge cited the government's hurried actions over a holiday weekend as justification for the extraordinary measure. The administration contended it was repatriating children at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's legal representatives.</p>

          <p>Representative James Comer, Chairman of the House Oversight Committee, has formally requested all Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell from the Treasury Department. The request, made in a letter on Sunday, is part of the committee's investigation into potential mismanagement of the federal government's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking network. This action follows the committee's establishment of a task force to declassify federal secrets and its subpoenas to several high-profile former government officials. The Treasury has been given a deadline of September 15 to produce the requested documents.</p>

          <p>Chef Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he recently underwent surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from the side of his face. He shared photos of the bandage and stitch marks, expressing gratitude to his medical team for their prompt action. Ramsay used the announcement to humorously dismiss facelift rumors and to deliver a serious public health message, urging his followers to wear sunscreen. This follows a previous incident where he used a bicycle accident to advocate for wearing helmets, continuing a pattern of sharing personal health scares to promote safety.</p>

The impressive shot occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, from a distance of 177 yards. This marks his second ace in less than a year, with the first coming at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. With this achievement, Charlie continues to build his own golfing legacy, now having two of the ten recorded holes-in-one his father has accomplished.</p>

          <p>According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Europe is developing detailed plans for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as a component of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview with the Financial Times, she stated that these plans would be supported by U.S. capabilities, including intelligence and command systems, an arrangement reportedly affirmed by President Trump. The potential deployment could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops. High-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders in Paris, signaling a significant step in long-term strategic planning for Ukraine's security.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates designed to operate jointly. The deal is seen as a major victory for the UK's defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion for Monday's drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers on Saturday night.

The upcoming drawing will be the 40th since the jackpot was last won on May 31. This marks the largest Powerball prize since a $1.326 billion jackpot was claimed in Oregon in April 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During an informal meeting, EU foreign ministers brainstormed future strategies to support Ukraine, with a key discussion centering on the possibility of secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners. EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas indicated this was being considered to further pressure Moscow's war machine. Other ideas floated included inviting Ukrainian arms companies to produce weapons on EU soil as a "safe haven" from Russian attacks. The ministers also held a heated debate on seizing frozen Russian central bank assets, signaling a potential shift toward more aggressive economic measures to aid Kyiv.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 13-year-long restoration project off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived 80 acres of vital kelp forest by removing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins. Led by The Bay Foundation, an army of divers manually smashed the urchins, which had created barren underwater landscapes by devouring young kelp. The removal of the voracious grazers allowed the "sequoias of the sea" to quickly regrow, restoring critical habitat for over 800 marine species and bolstering the local ecosystem. The project is now being viewed as a successful model for kelp restoration efforts in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, extending his championship lead.
