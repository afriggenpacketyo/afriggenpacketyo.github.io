          <p>During the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Tianjin, economists argued that for China to achieve long-term prosperity, it must shift from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy. Professor Jin Keyu noted that China's reliance on subsidizing production creates trade imbalances and global friction, suggesting that increasing internal consumption is crucial for harmonious international relations. The panel recommended that China's government incentivize consumption as a measure of success for local officials. This structural reform is presented as essential for sustainable growth, beyond just achieving technological supremacy with advancements like new AI models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tokyo stocks saw a significant rally, with the Nikkei 225 index rising above the 40,000 threshold for the first time in five months. The surge was driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs after the White House indicated President Trump might extend a 90-day pause on new duties. Investor sentiment was also bolstered by a strong performance in the U.S. tech sector, particularly in semiconductor stocks, and reduced tensions in the Middle East.
