Research indicates that competition for graduate roles is at a record high, with an average of 140 applications per job in 2024. Despite facing numerous rejections, Caitlin's persistence paid off, and she is set to begin her new role in September.</p>

          <p>Quebec's universal childcare program, costing less than $7 a day, provides high-quality early education, good jobs for childcare workers, and has helped close the gender pay gap. Enacted in 1997, the program aims to give equal opportunities to all children, especially those from low-income families, and increase government tax revenue. The program, inspired by US research on early childhood education, is now being replicated across Canada. Experts suggest that the US, facing its own childcare crisis, could learn from Quebec's model of affordable, accessible, and high-quality childcare.</p>

The PSA's success led to a decline in the use of the term and a rise in LGBTQ+ allyship.

Interest rates significantly influence annuity payouts, and today's elevated rates generally translate into stronger payouts.

          <p>Danny Boyle and Alex Garland's 28 Years Later, a follow-up to 28 Days Later, reinvents the zombie genre with more developed infected, odd human characters, and a dense plot. The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike who has never known society before the rage virus. Spike encounters new types of infected and characters from different films, creating a unique and unwieldy experience. Boyle's captivating digital aesthetic and the film's exploration of isolation and the human mind contribute to its distinctiveness.</p>
