          <p>Following Spain's semi-final victory over Germany, they are set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, creating a highly anticipated rematch of the 2023 World Cup final, which Spain won. This match pits the reigning World Cup champions against the defending European champions, the Lionesses. While England has undergone significant squad changes since their last major final, including new players and retirements, experts believe they have the capability to defeat Spain. The final is expected to be a tightly contested game between the two top teams in European women's football.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has described the current market as a mixed environment, presenting both positive and negative forces for investors to consider. He pointed to strong earnings from banks and healthcare, as well as the long-term potential of the data center sector, as reasons for optimism. However, Cramer also warned of speculative "froth" reminiscent of past market bubbles, cautioning against risky trading in certain low-priced stocks. He advised investors to remain skeptical but not cynical, acknowledging that while there are concerning speculative activities, there are also significant opportunities for profit.

          <p>Uber is launching a new pilot program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow female passengers to request female drivers. The feature, called "women drivers," will also enable women to opt for shared rides exclusively with other women. The company acknowledges that users of this feature may experience longer wait times due to the lower number of female drivers on the platform. This initiative, which allows female drivers to also set a preference for female riders, follows similar successful programs Uber has implemented in 40 other countries.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. The company's revenue surged by 35% year-over-year to 22.23 trillion won, with operating profit jumping 68% to 9.21 trillion won. This impressive performance is largely driven by sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative AI. As a leading supplier to companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix's success highlights the ongoing boom in the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has successfully avoided a technical recession, with its economy expanding by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. This growth marks a positive reversal from the 0.2% contraction experienced in the first quarter. The expansion was driven by a 0.7% increase in total consumption and a strong 4.2% rise in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. The positive GDP figures come as the country faces uncertainty over a potential trade deal with the U.S., which is crucial for its export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan focuses on accelerating AI innovation by expediting the construction of data centers and semiconductor plants, and by removing regulatory "red tape." It also includes provisions to create rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI models and to establish a program for exporting AI technology packages to U.S. allies. The comprehensive strategy aims to bolster the nation's technological and economic competitiveness, particularly against rivals like China.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of dozens of studies suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with significant health benefits, challenging the more commonly known 10,000-step goal. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research found that a 7,000-step daily routine was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and a 38% lower risk of dementia compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The step count was also associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and depressive symptoms. The authors suggest 7,000 steps may be a more realistic and achievable public health target for many people.</p>

          <p>IBM's shares fell in extended trading even after the company reported second-quarter results that exceeded overall Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings. The decline was attributed to the company's software revenue, which, despite growing 10%, came in slightly below analyst forecasts at $7.39 billion. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware, which saw strong growth. IBM's consulting and infrastructure segments also performed well, and the company reaffirmed its full-year forecast for revenue growth and free cash flow, signaling underlying confidence in its business.

The fast-food chain, an icon of Southern California, will continue its corporate operations in Baldwin Park. While the company is expanding eastward with a second headquarters in Tennessee, its roots and primary base will stay in the state where it was founded 76 years ago.</p>
