          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is set to become the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys, conceded the election. While vote counting is still ongoing, polls indicated strong and consistent support for Connolly, a former barrister known for her criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza. The Irish presidency is a largely ceremonial role, but Connolly's victory, backed by several left-leaning parties, is seen by some as a potential catalyst for a unified alternative in the next general election. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two terms.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has begun for two closely watched races: the New York City mayoral election and the New Jersey gubernatorial contest. In New York, voters are choosing between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and independent Andrew Cuomo. The New Jersey race features Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill. These off-year elections are considered potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of progressive versus moderate candidates and highlighting issues of affordability and internal party divisions ahead of future national contests.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state media outlets Xinhua and People's Daily, President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the nation's next five-year plan. The reports emphasize that Xi played a 'decisive role' and invested a significant amount of effort into overseeing and guiding the plan's formulation. This framework was reportedly based on extensive investigations during Xi's tours across China and underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee. The article highlights Xi's deep personal involvement in shaping the country's future economic and social development strategy.</p>

          <p>In a new interview with the BBC, former Vice President Kamala Harris strongly indicated that she is considering another run for the presidency in 2028, stating her political career is 'not done.' While not confirming a decision, she dismissed unfavorable poll numbers and expressed confidence that a woman will eventually be elected president. During the interview, Harris also heavily criticized former rival Donald Trump, labeling him a 'tyrant' with 'thin skin' who has weaponized the justice system. The interview is part of an international tour for her book about her 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>The growing trend of 'sleepmaxxing,' or optimizing rest through technology, highlights a burgeoning multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets designed to enhance sleep. A recent outage of the popular 'Eight Sleep' smart mattress, caused by an Amazon Web Services failure, left users with beds stuck at extreme temperatures or in upright positions, revealing the pitfalls of depending on cloud-connected devices for basic bodily functions. While some technologies can help those with specific sleep disorders, the increasing integration of tech into our sleep routines introduces more potential points of failure into what should be a natural process.</p>

          <p>Expansion club San Diego FC has achieved a historic inaugural season, securing the Western Conference’s No. 1 seed and setting MLS records for most wins and points by an expansion team. The club's success is attributed to a philosophy blending star players like Hirving 'Chucky' Lozano with a strong collective spirit and a focus on analytics and homegrown talent. A key part of their vision is the Right to Dream academy, which provides scholarships and holistic development for young athletes from the San Diego-Tijuana region. The team now aims to become the first expansion side since 1998 to win the MLS Cup.</p>

Described as an 'underwater phantom,' the drone features a transparent, lifelike body made from a hydrogel material, allowing it to operate nearly silently with low power consumption. The compact device is uniquely suited for covert monitoring in deep-sea environments, observing fragile ecosystems, and conducting precise inspections of underwater structures. Its design represents a significant advancement in biomimetic underwater surveillance technology.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, just seven weeks after being sacked from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cabinet during a reshuffle. Her victory over Bridget Phillipson, who was seen as the candidate closer to Starmer, is viewed as an expression of the party's anxiety over its current political standing. While her win was not a landslide, it places a prominent, recently dismissed figure in a senior elected role. Powell has indicated her critiques of the party's direction will mainly be articulated privately as Labour navigates a period of internal turmoil.</p>

          <p>A certified child life specialist and therapist advises parents on how to say 'no' to children in a way that builds connection rather than conflict. The key is to turn the boundary into a teachable moment by explaining the 'why' behind the rule, which helps children understand and accept limits. Offering control through choices, such as 'you can play in the backyard or the basement,' empowers children while keeping them within safe boundaries. Consistency is also crucial, as it teaches kids to trust and expect limits, fostering a sense of safety and predictability in their world.</p>

She suggests that without a parent watching from the sidelines, children are less likely to feel nervous or 'outsource their motivation,' allowing them to play more freely and take risks. Wambach believes this approach helps children become self-starters, a crucial trait for success in adulthood. When attending games, she recommends focusing on acts of leadership and teamwork rather than the final score.</p>
