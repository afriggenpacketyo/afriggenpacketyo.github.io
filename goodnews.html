          <p>UK and EU leaders are preparing for a summit aimed at fostering a new era of cooperation following Brexit, with discussions expected on trade, immigration, and defense. While significant new deals are unlikely, the summit seeks to improve existing arrangements, particularly in areas like defense procurement and security cooperation. The UK hopes to ease administrative burdens for farmers and the food industry, and commitments are expected on energy, migration, agriculture, and data sharing. Despite high expectations, negotiations are ongoing, with disagreements remaining on issues such as access for young citizens to live and work in each other's countries and fishing rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's push for a sweeping legislative package, dubbed "one big, beautiful bill," echoes Ronald Reagan's ambitious use of budget reconciliation in 1981 to enact Reaganomics. Like Reagan, Trump aims to implement significant tax cuts and increase military spending, but faces challenges in navigating congressional processes. Reagan's success was facilitated by a Republican-controlled Senate and a working coalition in the House, allowing him to overcome resistance and enact his agenda. The use of reconciliation, a tool created in 1974, allows for the passage of legislation with a simple majority, bypassing the Senate filibuster.</p>

          <p>After a quarter-century drought, the New York Knicks have clinched a spot in the Eastern Conference finals, defeating the reigning champions Boston Celtics in a decisive 4-2 series victory. The Knicks' transformation from a struggling franchise to legitimate title contenders is attributed to strategic trades, shrewd free-agent signings, and a hands-off approach by team president Leon Rose. Despite facing injuries and roster changes throughout the season, the Knicks found their identity as a resilient and determined team, setting the stage for a highly anticipated matchup against the Indiana Pacers.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas, revealing that they migrated from modern-day Russia approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. Researchers sequenced the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, finding that early settlers split into groups isolated in different environmental settings, affecting their genetic makeup.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a flexible approach in courting Taiwan's allies, as evidenced by the participation of Haiti and St Lucia in a high-level forum in Beijing. Despite maintaining diplomatic ties with Taiwan, these Caribbean nations sent delegations to the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum. Analysts suggest this reflects a pragmatic diplomacy trend, where countries engage with Beijing without necessarily shifting their allegiance. Taiwan's foreign ministry stated that both countries had notified them in advance of their participation and that relations remained stable.</p>
