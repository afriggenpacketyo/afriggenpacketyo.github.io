          <p>The corporate travel and expense management startup Navan has officially filed to go public, aiming to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker "NAVN." The company reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months, serving over 10,000 customers. This move comes amid a resurgent IPO market, which has seen a significant increase in deal activity and proceeds raised compared to the previous year. Navan's filing highlights the growing investor appetite for tech and startup IPOs after a period of relative quiet. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a new funding round that would value the startup at $200 billion. This valuation reflects the immense investor appetite for companies developing foundational AI models, following similar large-scale funding for competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report on X, the news highlights the massive capital being invested into the AI sector. The funds would likely be used to acquire computing resources and talent to develop xAI's chatbot, Grok. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England, the host nation and top-ranked team, is set to play against France in a highly anticipated Women's Rugby World Cup semi-final. The English team, known as the Red Roses, enters the match as the clear favorite, having won their last 16 encounters against the French and maintaining a 31-match world record winning streak. However, their last Six Nations match was a narrow 43-42 victory, suggesting a competitive game is expected. The winner of this contest will advance to the final to play against Canada, who defeated defending champions New Zealand.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, despite the Federal Reserve implementing its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive market reaction suggests investors are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt. Analysts suggest the rising yields could reflect growing GDP estimates and slightly higher inflation, indicating that the bond market is not fully convinced of a slowing economy. The Fed has signaled that two more rate cuts are likely before the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly has clarified that team minority owner Tom Brady is not involved in weekly game planning, contrary to a recent media report. During a "Monday Night Football" broadcast, it was suggested that Kelly and Brady speak multiple times a week to go over film and the game plan. Kelly explained that while he uses Brady as a valuable resource for general football strategy and insights, particularly from Brady's extensive experience, he is not part of the team's weekly preparation process. The NFL has confirmed there are no policies prohibiting an owner from being in the coaches' booth.</p>

          <p>A community-led nonprofit, the Molokai Heritage Trust, has formed with the ambitious goal of purchasing over 55,000 acres of ancestral land on the island of Molokai. The land, known as Molokai Ranch, is currently owned by a Hong Kong-based investment firm and has been listed for $260 million since 2017 after development plans were opposed by residents. The trust aims to restore the neglected land, which includes critical infrastructure like water systems, to a state of "aina momona" (abundant land). This historic effort represents a significant move toward returning Hawaiian lands to local stewardship.</p>

The successful debut is another positive sign for the tech IPO market, which has seen a resurgence in recent months after a prolonged quiet period.

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research predicts a significant increase in U.S. electricity demand, largely driven by the power requirements of AI data centers. The report projects 265 gigawatts of new electricity supply will be needed by 2029, a substantial upward revision from last year's forecast. This bullish outlook reinforces the investment thesis for industrial companies like GE Vernova, which manufactures power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which produces electrical equipment for the grid. For GE Vernova, strong demand and limited production capacity are creating favorable pricing power and a multi-year backlog of orders. (not investment advice)</p>

The new guidance specifies which occupations qualify and which are excluded, notably those in "specified service trades or businesses" like healthcare and legal services. Importantly, the regulations state that automatic gratuities, such as those required for large parties at restaurants, will not be considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary.

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, including one this week, the cost of borrowing is beginning to decrease. Among the cheapest options currently available are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which have variable rates that can fall further with future cuts, and home equity loans, which offer the stability of a fixed rate. While personal loan rates remain in the double digits, they are still a more affordable alternative to high-interest credit cards. For consumers with good credit, these products offer effective ways to access financing in a more favorable rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay reflecting on the career of actor and director Robert Redford suggests that a central theme of his work was the corrupting nature and ultimate emptiness of victory. Despite his "golden-boy" image, Redford often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal triumphs were Pyrrhic, from the ambitious skier in "Downhill Racer" to the morally compromised politician in "The Candidate." The article argues that Redford, himself a talented athlete, was deeply skeptical of America's obsession with winning. Through his films, he consistently explored the idea that true value lies in the process and the art, not in the fleeting glory of success.</p>

Officials plan to reinstate a preferred booking slot system for LNG carriers and are developing a new "Interoceanic Energy Corridor," a pipeline to transport natural gas liquids across the isthmus, freeing up canal capacity. These initiatives are designed to make the route more reliable and attractive for energy shippers who had diverted to longer routes. The move comes as the canal forecasts a decrease in container traffic for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint failed to meet basic federal court standards. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday stated the filing was "repetitive," "superfluous," and improperly used as a "platform to rage against an adversary" rather than presenting a clear case. Trump has been given 28 days to file an amended complaint. The lawsuit, which also named publisher Penguin Random House, is one of several legal actions Trump has pursued against media organizations.</p>
