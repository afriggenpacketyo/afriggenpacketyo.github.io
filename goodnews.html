          <p>Meta's Chief Product Officer, Chris Cox, has declared that smart glasses represent the future of computing, moving beyond handheld devices. He described a future where users interact with computers through natural voice commands and gestures, similar to how people interact with each other. This vision is materializing with the new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which feature an in-lens display and a neural wristband for control. The device's initial capabilities focus on core functions like messaging, aiming to make daily digital interactions more fluid.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian government has eased its martial law restrictions to allow men between the ages of 18 and 22 to leave and re-enter the country. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the policy aims to give young men more freedom, hoping it will encourage them to build their futures in Ukraine rather than leaving permanently. The decision has generated a national debate, with supporters viewing it as a positive step towards normalcy, while critics worry it is unfair to active soldiers and that many who leave will not return.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant directly into the Chrome browser for users on Mac, Windows, and mobile devices across the United States. This strategic move aims to bolster Google's position against emerging AI-driven search competitors like OpenAI and Perplexity. The integration will allow users to leverage Gemini for tasks such as summarizing web content, organizing tabs, and accessing other Google services like Maps and Calendar without navigating away from their current page, creating a more seamless browsing experience.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Switching to Slower-Growing Chicken Breeds Could Prevent Suffering for Pennies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new paper in the journal Nature Food, the severe suffering of chickens bred for rapid growth could be drastically reduced for a very small cost. Researchers calculated that by switching to slower-growing chicken breeds, an hour of what they term "disabling" or "excruciating" pain could be prevented for just half a cent to three cents. This change would address widespread welfare issues like lameness and heart failure, though the poultry industry has raised concerns that it could increase production costs and the environmental footprint of farming.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis on How Recent Fed Rate Cuts Affect Reverse Mortgages for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:58:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut has a complex effect on reverse mortgages, a financial tool often used by retirees to access home equity. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates do not always follow the Fed's lead directly, as they are influenced by a wider range of factors. However, a lower rate environment can be beneficial, as it often increases the principal limit, allowing homeowners to borrow a larger percentage of their home's value. This article advises retirees to carefully compare fixed and adjustable-rate options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has predicted that the stock market is unlikely to experience more than a 3% to 5% correction before the end of the year, absent a major unforeseen event. He posits that many money managers are currently under-invested and will likely use any market dip as a buying opportunity, providing a floor for stock prices. While the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut offers some stability, Cramer identifies the primary short-term risk to the market as escalating geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China over Taiwan.

The article highlights that states lacking an income tax, such as Texas and New Hampshire, often have higher property taxes to fund local services. As this cost is frequently underestimated by buyers, experts recommend budgeting an additional 5-10% to avoid unexpected financial strain.</p>
