          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to scale back its federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). The agreement ensures that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, revoking the appointment of a federal official to the role. The DOJ also consented to rewriting a directive that had aimed to end D.C.'s "sanctuary city" policies limiting police cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This reversal came after a federal judge indicated she would likely intervene, emphasizing the limits of presidential power under the Home Rule Act.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main house on the property. This development comes a year after the city passed a pioneering ordinance to allow such sales, aiming to create a new, more accessible form of homeownership. Officials hope this for-sale ADU, often called a "granny flat," will serve as a model for other cities and help address the state's severe housing crisis by providing a new type of starter home. ADUs already account for a significant portion of California's new housing growth.</p>

The contract was originally drawn up as a hopeful gesture by the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, in the early 2000s. Gabriel, who led the U.S. Air Force Band to international acclaim, stated that "your word is your bond," and successfully led the Illinois-based band one last time.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes. Two recent clinical trials found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for other carbohydrates like bread, did not cause significant blood sugar spikes and in some cases even led to improvements in metabolic health markers. One study showed that certain Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and portion control, suggesting that the fruit can be part of a balanced diet for individuals with type 2 diabetes under clinical supervision.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting the late Lakers icon Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers-themed basketball jersey. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that he altered the iconic image of Bryant to fit the mural's theme while still capturing his famous "Mamba mentality." While most reactions have been positive, celebrating the crossover of two beloved Los Angeles sports figures, the artistic choice has also sparked debate among fans about altering such a well-known image.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her upcoming album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns to align themselves with the superstar. The marketing blitz was triggered after Swift, who has frequently worn orange recently, discussed her connection to the color on the "New Heights" podcast. Companies from United Airlines to Shake Shack quickly adopted orange hues in their branding, hoping to capitalize on the massive economic and cultural influence Swift commands. The phenomenon underscores the significant impact of Swift's activities, which often create major economic boosts and marketing opportunities for other businesses.</p>

          <p>At a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, 104-year-old veteran Captain Yavar Abbas moved the audience and the royal family by going off-script to salute King Charles III. Abbas, who served as a combat cameraman in the British Indian Army, praised the King for attending the event while undergoing cancer treatment, which visibly moved Queen Camilla to tears. The veteran, himself a cancer survivor, shared his extraordinary story of fighting on the Asian front, detesting imperialism but choosing to fight against fascism. His message today is one of peace, stating that after witnessing the horrors of war, humanity seems to have learned nothing.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback, with its managing director confirming the return of standalone stores to the UK High Street. The relaunch is being kicked off with the brand's first catwalk show in seven years, aiming to recapture the "cool" factor it lost before its parent company, Arcadia, collapsed in 2020. Since being acquired by online retailer Asos, the brand has only been available online. Industry experts note that while nostalgia may attract former customers, Topshop will face challenges in appealing to a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion prices in a difficult retail environment.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Premier League season with a 4-2 victory against Bournemouth in an eventful match at Anfield, though the performance revealed significant defensive weaknesses. New striker Hugo Ekitike made an impressive debut, scoring one goal and assisting another, quickly becoming a fan favorite. However, the team's backline appeared porous, allowing Bournemouth to equalize at one point and keeping the outcome in doubt until late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah. The match highlighted the challenges facing the reigning champions as they integrate new players and attempt to address the defensive frailties that were apparent during their pre-season preparations.</p>

Mixue now operates more outlets worldwide than McDonald's or Starbucks. However, the industry faces significant challenges, including market saturation in China, intense price wars, and the difficulty of maintaining quality control across thousands of franchised stores. These pressures raise questions about whether the current boom is a sustainable business model or a fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a simple, barebones pickup truck with a starting price that could be around half the U.S. average. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs by offering a basic two-seat vehicle, then allowing owners to customize it with over 100 planned accessories or even third-party add-ons. The company had initially advertised a sub-$20,000 price after federal tax credits, but the rollback of those incentives raises the effective price closer to $28,000. This positions the Slate Truck against more established and feature-rich competitors, testing whether its low-cost, customizable model remains compelling to consumers.</p>

          <p>In response to the Trump administration's move to federalize the Washington D.C. police force, key Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to terminate the emergency order. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, the resolution argues that the president has not demonstrated the necessary "special conditions of an emergency" to justify such an unprecedented takeover. The sponsors, including Representative Jamie Raskin and Senator Chris Van Hollen, contend that the action is a "lawless" attack on the district's autonomy and public safety. The legislative effort represents a formal congressional pushback against what they describe as an abuse of executive power.</p>

The surreal experience led to McCreadie traveling to New York to record music for the film, which features Denzel Washington.
