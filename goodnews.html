          <p>The first six months of 2025 demonstrated the importance of remaining invested despite market volatility, particularly in response to trade tariff announcements.

It advises focusing on long-term fundamentals and corporate earnings rather than reacting to alarming headlines. Areas like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and value-oriented retail are highlighted as resilient sectors that can perform well regardless of broader trade disputes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a controversial plan to cut forecasters' access to a key satellite data program essential for hurricane prediction. The decision to delay followed an apparent intervention from a senior NASA official, after scientists warned the move could set hurricane forecasting back by decades. The data, collected by Department of Defense satellites, was scheduled to be cut off on June 30. The administration cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the initial plan, a justification that had not been previously publicized, while assuring the quality of forecasts would not be affected.</p>

          <p>The White House asserted that Canada "caved" to President Trump after the country rescinded its planned digital services tax (DST). The move came after Trump threatened to terminate all trade negotiations with Ottawa if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt framed the reversal as a "big victory for our tech companies and our American workers." Following Canada's concession, trade talks have resumed, with top economic aide Kevin Hassett suggesting the U.S. will pressure other nations to drop similar taxes as part of future negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that will lift some economic sanctions on Syria, a move intended to help stabilize the country following the ousting of dictator Bashar al-Assad. The order would terminate a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets, though other sanctions, including those targeting Assad personally and those related to terrorism and human rights abuses, will remain. The decision follows a meeting between President Trump and Syria's new interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who argued that existing sanctions were hindering his transitional government's ability to function and pay for reconstruction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key provision in President Trump's proposed budget bill would create a new federal income tax deduction for workers who earn tips, effectively making that income tax-free at the federal level. The White House frames this as a benefit for the working class, but critics argue its impact is limited. According to policy experts, over a third of tipped workers already earn too little to pay federal income tax and would not benefit. The proposed legislation also has variations, with the Senate version capping the deduction at $25,000 and phasing it out for higher earners, and the tax break itself is set to expire in 2028.</p>
