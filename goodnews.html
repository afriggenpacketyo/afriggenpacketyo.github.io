          <h2>Number of Missing Individuals in Texas Floods Drastically Reduces</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 22:22:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly revised the number of individuals missing after severe flooding, lowering the count from nearly 100 to just three. This reduction is attributed to extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies, which successfully verified the safety of many people initially unaccounted for. Despite this positive development in Kerr County, several people remain missing in other counties. The overall death toll from the floods across Texas stands at 134, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the hard-hit Kerr County area.</p>

          <p>Modern technology, including data from a Fitbit and Google Dashboard, played a pivotal role in solving the 2016 murder of Nicole Vander Heyden in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Initially, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was the prime suspect, but his Fitbit data provided an alibi by showing minimal activity during the time of the murder. Investigators then used DNA evidence to identify a new suspect, George Burch. Burch’s location data from his Android phone's Google Dashboard tracked his movements to the crime scene, where the body was found, and where her belongings were discarded, leading to his conviction.</p>

          <h2>Jennifer Love Hewitt Addresses Rumored Feud with Former Co-Star Sarah Michelle Gellar</h2>

          <p>Jennifer Love Hewitt has commented on long-standing rumors of a feud with her "I Know What You Did Last Summer" co-star, Sarah Michelle Gellar, revealing they have not spoken since the film's release when she was 18. Hewitt dismissed the speculation as a narrative people create, stating there is no bad blood on her side. The rumors gained traction after Gellar gave a terse response about Hewitt's potential return to the franchise and later omitted her from a social media post. Gellar has since clarified her actions, citing non-disclosure agreements and noting she simply didn't encounter Hewitt at a recent premiere.</p>

          <p>A popular social media claim that 55,000 used Wimbledon tennis balls are annually donated to become homes for threatened harvest mice has been found to be outdated. While Wimbledon did donate balls for this purpose in the past, including a notable instance in 2001, it is not a current, ongoing annual practice. A spokesperson for The Wildlife Trusts confirmed they have not worked with Wimbledon in this capacity for some time. Currently, used tennis balls from the tournament are sold on-site, with the proceeds benefiting the Wimbledon Foundation, the tournament's official charity organization.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law to target individuals who plan mass killings but are not motivated by a specific ideology, closing a gap in current anti-terrorism legislation. The move comes in response to the Southport attack, where the perpetrator was not driven by a recognized terrorist cause. Under existing law, suspects can be jailed for life for preparing terrorist acts, but this requires an ideological motive. The new offense would allow police to intervene and charge individuals for preparatory actions, like researching targets, regardless of their motivation.</p>

While performing her hit song "Roar" above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption as the prop was safely brought back to the stage. After the song, she humorously remarked, "Not today, Satan," acknowledging the brief but scary incident.

          <p>Drivers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly parking in nearby lay-bys and side streets to avoid paying rising "kiss-and-fly" charges at the official drop-off zone. A recent survey found that over half of the UK's busiest airports have increased these fees, with Edinburgh charging £6 for a 10-minute stay. To circumvent the cost, drivers wait for passengers to call and then arrange a quick pickup near airport hotels or the free, but more distant, drop-off area. This behavior highlights public frustration with what many perceive as exorbitant fees for a brief and necessary service.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in the UK regarding the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for parents, and potentially lower holiday travel prices. However, many teachers oppose the idea, citing the need for the long break to recharge and plan. Some school districts have already moved to a five-week summer break with a longer two-week autumn half-term, but the proposal remains divisive among parents, educators, and even students.</p>

While a proposal to reduce the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to push people toward stocks and shares has faced opposition, it has not been ruled out.
