          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, about two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The poll also found that the 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. Furthermore, many believe the space program provides technological benefits for everyone, underscoring a broad and enduring public enthusiasm for space exploration.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are disrupting the global AI landscape by releasing powerful, open-source large language models. Unlike the closed, proprietary systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google, these free-to-use models encourage worldwide collaboration and have quickly gained support from the global developer community. This open-source movement is seen as a serious strategic challenge to U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence. It fosters a wave of new applications in China and presents a viable alternative for developers who have been excluded from accessing leading American AI.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce includes the return of these hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes as the director of Israel's Mossad reportedly visited Washington to discuss potential relocation plans for Palestinians remaining in Gaza. Trump has been actively promoting the ceasefire deal, which is being mediated by Qatari officials.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, has found healing from his wartime trauma by building a unique carousel in Nederland, Colorado. During the Vietnam War, Harrison would listen to a music box and daydream about a carousel in a mountain meadow to escape the brutality of his surroundings. After battling PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, spending 26 years restoring a carousel and hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" has brought joy to over a million visitors and has become a source of profound healing for its creator.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating the first major federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bipartisan legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear guidelines for banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Supporters believe this will foster innovation and enable faster, lower-cost transactions, while integrating digital currencies more safely into the mainstream financial system. The law is seen as a significant step in legitimizing the crypto industry in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top adviser at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system needs to rewrite its rules to accommodate a future dominated by tokenized assets. The rise of stablecoins and other digital tokens presents new challenges for payment infrastructure and complicates efforts like anti-money-laundering due to their borderless and pseudonymous nature. This warning comes as the Trump administration's embrace of digital currencies fuels market growth and attracts increased regulatory scrutiny worldwide. The adviser emphasized that stablecoins are at the forefront of a fundamental shift in the monetary system. (not investment advice)</p>

Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often boosts a company's stock price, as index-tracking funds are required to purchase its shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down for the year, Block's addition reflects the increasing weight of technology companies in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild leg swelling, President Trump's condition is described by medical experts as common and generally benign. CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool, and affects about one in three U.S. adults, particularly older individuals. White House physician Dr. Sean P. Barbabella found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with the condition being manageable for most patients.</p>

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK are reporting a major surge in wasp populations this summer, likely due to a very warm and dry spring creating ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role as apex predators in the ecosystem, controlling pests in gardens and agricultural landscapes. To coexist peacefully, people are advised to avoid agitating the insects and can distract them by placing something sweet away from picnic areas. Despite their nuisance, the thriving common wasp population is a positive sign for insect health amid wider global declines.</p>

The show, written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," spoofs their story through the lens of "The Lord of the Rings," inspired by an old tabloid myth about Coleen's engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the play is an affectionate homage to the couple, celebrating their resilience as "strong characters" who have endured intense public scrutiny.

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV vaccination program to include premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, eligible infants will be offered a single long-acting injection of Nirsevimab, which provides about 80% protection against the virus. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new program aims to protect infants born too early to benefit from the maternal vaccine offered during pregnancy. Health officials highlighted the move as a crucial step to protect vulnerable children and reduce pressure on the health service.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a common gene variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a certain variant of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a molecule produced by gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The research opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies, offering new hope for managing the condition.</p>
