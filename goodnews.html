          <p>Taylor Swift joined the festivities for Brittany Mahomes' 30th birthday, which was celebrated with a cowgirl-themed weekend in Nashville. Mahomes shared a series of photos on social media, including one of her and Swift enjoying cocktails, highlighting their close friendship that has grown since Swift began dating Travis Kelce. The event underscores the strong bond between the two, who have frequently been seen together at Kansas City Chiefs games. The celebration comes shortly after Swift and Kelce announced their engagement, an event for which Mahomes had previously shared her public congratulations and support for the couple.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled against the Department of Justice's demand for Google to sell its Chrome web browser as part of a landmark antitrust case. While Google can retain Chrome and its Android operating system, the company is now barred from entering into exclusive default search engine contracts and must share certain search data with its competitors. The ruling addresses Google's monopolistic practices of paying billions to companies like Apple to ensure its search engine is the default on their devices. The decision acknowledges the changing landscape of online search with the rise of AI, aiming to restore competition without dismantling key parts of Google's operations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "Power and the Palace" by Valentine Low, details a number of previously private stories about the British royal family's interactions with the political world. Among the most striking claims is an account of Queen Camilla, as a teenager in the 1960s, fighting off a sexual assault on a train and having the perpetrator arrested. The book also asserts that the late Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union, viewing it as part of the post-war stability she supported. Other anecdotes include political figures' late-night drinks with King Charles on the royal train and tense negotiations over the funding of the monarchy.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B in a $24 million lawsuit brought by a former security guard, Emani Ellis, who accused the artist of assault in 2018. Ellis alleged that Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, spat on her and cut her cheek with a fingernail at a Beverly Hills medical building, causing lasting harm. Cardi B testified that Ellis had been following and filming her while she was trying to maintain the privacy of her pregnancy. The jury sided with the rapper, who will not have to pay any damages, concluding a trial that had gained attention for her candid testimony.</p>

          <h2>Hawaii's Kilauea Volcano Erupts Again, Launching Lava Fountains from Summit Crater</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 19:41:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, shooting lava fountains up to 330 feet into the air from its Halemaʻumaʻu summit crater. This marks the 32nd eruptive episode since the current activity began in December 2024, with all lava flows so far being contained within the crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that magma is accumulating in a lower chamber before being forced to the surface, creating spectacular but currently contained lava displays. While the eruption poses no immediate threat to surrounding communities, its future behavior remains unpredictable, drawing both scientific interest and visitor attention.</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Shares Surge 8% as Google Avoids Harshest Antitrust Penalties</h2>

          <p>Investors responded positively to a federal judge's ruling in the landmark antitrust case against Google, causing parent company Alphabet's stock to jump 8% in extended trading. The market's relief stems from the decision to not force Google to sell its lucrative Chrome browser or Android operating system, which were the most severe penalties sought by the Department of Justice. While the court found Google held an illegal monopoly in internet search, the remedies were viewed as manageable. The ruling imposes limits on Google's exclusive distribution contracts but avoids a structural breakup, a result that investors see as a significant victory for the tech giant.

          <p>Amid a rise in parking-related fraud, police and councils are issuing warnings and advice to help the public protect themselves from common scams. These schemes include fraudulent text messages with malicious links demanding payment for fake fines and physical skimming devices attached to parking payment machines to steal card details. To avoid falling victim, experts advise checking that any fine notice includes the vehicle registration, time, and location of the offense. Additionally, people should be wary of urgent texts, never click on suspicious links, and inspect payment machines for any signs of tampering, such as mismatched branding or bolted-on components.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to take sufficient action against the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursors. The legislation seeks to hold accountable Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement credible measures, such as "know-your-customer" procedures, to prevent the flow of these synthetic opioids. Sponsored by Rep. Andy Barr, the bill targets the source of the chemicals used to produce the deadly drug. While supporters emphasize the need to attack the crisis at its origin, some Democrats noted that sanctions alone are not enough and stressed the importance of diplomacy and international law enforcement cooperation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a sharply critical ruling, federal judge Charles Breyer has declared that the Trump administration acted illegally by deploying National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles for law enforcement purposes. The judge found the action to be a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits using the military for domestic policing. The opinion details how the administration attempted to create a "constitutional exception" to justify the deployment, a legal argument Breyer dismissed as not grounded in history, jurisprudence, or common sense. This ruling rebukes the administration's expansive view of presidential power and blocks further such deployments in California, setting a precedent for potential future conflicts.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer addressed Tuesday's market downturn, which saw major indices fall as investors took profits from the year's leading tech stocks. Cramer attributed the decline not to fundamental issues with companies like Nvidia or Apple, but to typical September profit-taking by large institutions and broader investor anxiety over tariff rulings and the upcoming labor report. He advised long-term investors to trust the quality of the companies they own and to avoid panic-selling. Cramer suggested holding onto strong growth stocks, which he believes can weather such pullbacks and are likely to rebound, cautioning against making decisions based on a single day's performance.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has started its verdict deliberations in the historic trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of orchestrating a coup plot to unlawfully retain power after his 2022 election defeat. The prosecution alleges that Bolsonaro and seven others formed a criminal association aiming to violently overthrow the democratic order, culminating in the January 8, 2023 storming of government buildings by his supporters. If convicted, the right-wing populist could face a prison sentence of over 40 years. Presiding Justice Alexandre de Moraes has described the plot as an attempt to establish a dictatorship, emphasizing that the court will remain inflexible in defending Brazil's democracy.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot swells to an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis of lottery data highlights significant variations in take-home winnings based on state taxes. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest post-tax payouts, while those in high-tax states like New York would see their winnings reduced the most. The odds of winning the jackpot remain 1 in 292.2 million. The data also identifies "hot" and "cold" numbers over the last 100 drawings, though each draw is a random event. This will be the 41st drawing since the jackpot was last won in May.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives of its robotaxis in Denver and Seattle. Initially, the vehicles will be operated manually by human safety drivers to validate the technology and operations in these new environments before any potential launch of a fully autonomous service. This expansion is part of Waymo's strategy to scale its driverless ride-hailing service, which is already commercially available in several cities including Phoenix, San Francisco, and Austin. The test fleets in the new cities will consist of the company's electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr models, marking another step toward broader adoption of autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to introduce a new law in England that would prohibit the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to individuals under the age of 16. The ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, cafes, vending machines, and online stores, covering popular brands like Red Bull and Prime. This move addresses growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative effects of these drinks on young people, which are linked to headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. While many supermarkets already have a voluntary ban, this legislation would make the restriction mandatory to protect the health of children.</p>
