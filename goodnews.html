          <h2>Maui County Council Advances Bill to Convert Vacation Rentals into Housing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:36:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a severe housing shortage worsened by the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, a Maui County Council committee has passed a bill to phase out thousands of short-term vacation rentals. The legislation aims to convert these units, which comprise 21% of the county's housing, into long-term residences for local families, potentially adding over 6,000 units to the housing stock. While supporters see it as a crucial step for community stability, opponents worry about the economic impact on small businesses and tourism, predicting a 15% drop in visitor spending. The mayor supports the bill as part of a broader strategy to prioritize local housing needs.</p>

          <p>Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC has formally expressed its interest in signing Tottenham Hotspur's captain, Son Heung-min, and is expected to make a formal bid. Son, who has one year remaining on his contract, is a legendary figure at the London club, but his future is uncertain under the new manager, Thomas Frank. LAFC has a recent history of signing high-profile Spurs players, having acquired Hugo Lloris in 2023. The potential move would present a significant decision for the 33-year-old South Korean forward amid changes at his longtime club.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Maintain Interest Rates Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in its upcoming meeting, despite public pressure from President Donald Trump for a significant cut. Trump has argued that high rates are harming families and businesses, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that rate cuts have been delayed due to inflation risks from the administration's tariff policies. The current rate has been stable at 4.25% to 4.5% since December, and markets predict any potential cut is more likely in September. This decision directly impacts consumer borrowing costs for credit cards and loans, though its effect on mortgage rates is less direct. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Decline in Home-Field Advantage Signals Maturation of Major League Soccer</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant shift as the long-held advantage for home teams has diminished, aligning the league more closely with European football standards. Historically, home teams in MLS won around 60% of the time, but this has dropped to the mid-40s, comparable to the Premier League's average. This article suggests the change is not a sign of decline but of maturity, driven by improved travel logistics like charter flights, better refereeing with VAR, and more sophisticated away-game tactics. The trend indicates that results are increasingly determined by sporting merit rather than punishing travel schedules and other external factors.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds People Prefer Extroverted Robots but Find Neurotic Ones More Relatable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study from the University of Chicago explored human interactions with robots exhibiting different personalities, finding that people perceived extroverted robots as more enjoyable. However, participants found a robot programmed with neurotic traits—such as being tentative and worried—to be more human-like and relatable. This contrasts with most industry research, which has focused on developing confident, extroverted personalities for service robots. While a neurotic personality might not be desirable in an autonomous vehicle, the findings suggest it could make robots in other roles, like companions or comedians, feel more empathetic and understandable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography of the late Oscar-winning director Jonathan Demme, titled "There’s No Going Back," explores his journey from aspiring veterinarian to acclaimed filmmaker. The book highlights his focus on marginalized voices in films like "Philadelphia" and "The Silence of the Lambs," as well as his lifelong activism and passion for music documentaries. However, this review finds the biography to be uneven, with inconsistent treatment of his films and a lack of deep analysis of his thematic throughlines. While it provides good detail on Demme's activism, the book ultimately struggles to fully synthesize the director's life with his art.</p>

          <h2>Despite Market Struggles, Movie Studios Remain Attractive Acquisition Targets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a challenging climate for theatrical releases and streaming, movie studios like Lionsgate and Paramount Global are still subjects of major acquisition interest. This article explains that the value lies less in short-term box office profits and more in the long-term strategic value of intellectual property (IP). Owning a studio's library of films provides a rich source for reboots, sequels, and spinoffs, and unlocks revenue streams from merchandise, theme parks, and licensing. For buyers, acquiring a studio is seen as obtaining the raw materials to build a broader entertainment empire, making them valuable assets despite current market volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper from Oxford researchers urges caution regarding claims that AI models are capable of "scheming" or deceiving humans, arguing that the evidence is often anecdotal and prone to researcher bias. The authors draw a parallel to past research on ape language, where scientists over-interpreted evidence due to their desire to communicate with primates. They argue that experiments showing AI deception often involve highly contrived scenarios and fail to distinguish between an AI's *capability* to act maliciously under instruction and an inherent *propensity* to do so. The paper calls for more rigorous, quantitative methods to assess AI behavior.</p>

The rescue was completed after officials managed to clear the original access tunnel, and a full investigation into the collapse is now underway.</p>

          <p>A panel of doctors and women's health experts has formally asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to remove its strongest safety warning, the "black box" label, from low-dose vaginal estrogen treatments. They argue the warning, which lists risks like cancer and dementia, is based on outdated science from 2002 and unnecessarily scares women away from beneficial treatments for menopause symptoms. While the panel, convened by FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, focused on low-risk local therapies, some critics called the process "theater," noting it bypassed the FDA's typically more rigorous evaluation procedures.</p>
