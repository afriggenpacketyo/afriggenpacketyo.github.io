          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum concerning potential changes to citizenship and labor laws. The referendum, initiated by an NGO-led campaign, includes questions on reducing the residency time required for non-EU citizens to apply for citizenship from 10 to 5 years, as well as worker protections against dismissal. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition is urging supporters to abstain from voting, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout. The center-left Democratic Party supports the referendum, viewing it as a way to better integrate second-generation Italians and improve worker rights.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance," where institutions preemptively cater to Donald Trump's agenda, and argues for a strategy of "anticipatory noncompliance." Examples include universities censoring themselves and corporations reducing diversity programs to avoid Trump's ire. The author highlights instances where resistance is emerging, such as universities pushing back against government overreach and states challenging the administration's interpretation of civil rights law. The piece advocates for a multi-faceted approach, including mass demonstrations, consumer boycotts, and litigation, to restore democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed access to safe abortions through self-managed methods, particularly by spreading information about misoprostol. Activists shared knowledge about the drug, which can be used to safely terminate pregnancies, despite restrictive abortion laws. They established hotlines, published manuals, and provided accompaniment to women throughout the abortion process. These efforts contributed to the legalization of abortion in Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico, demonstrating the power of grassroots activism and information sharing.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court decision in *Ames v. Ohio* unanimously ruled that a heterosexual woman, Marlean Ames, could sue for discrimination after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a lesbian and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. The case, decided by Justice Jackson, highlights the central question in the debate over diversity, equity, and inclusion: how much should the law treat a person as an individual rather than as a member of a group? The ruling underscores that discrimination based on sexual orientation is illegal, regardless of whether the plaintiff is part of a historically disadvantaged group.</p>
