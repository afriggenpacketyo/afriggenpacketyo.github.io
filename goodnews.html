The concert had sold approximately 50,000 tickets, and promoters assured fans that previously purchased tickets would be valid for the rescheduled date. √Ålvarez's U.S. work visa was previously revoked in 2017 due to alleged ties to a drug trafficker but was regained in 2025.</p>

          <p>California officials have initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds while controlling dust. The project involves flooding hundreds of acres of dry lake bed, representing the state's largest effort to address environmental problems at the Salton Sea. The wetlands project is designed to create lower-salinity habitats where fish and birds can thrive, helping to improve conditions at the state's largest lake and address public health concerns in nearby communities.</p>
