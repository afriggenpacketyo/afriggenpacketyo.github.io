          <h2>China Designates 'Drone Flight Planner' as New Occupation Amid Low-Altitude Economy Boom</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 22:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources has officially recognized "drone flight planner" as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's "low-altitude economy." This sector, which includes all air activities up to 1,000 meters, is considered a strategic emerging industry by Beijing, aimed at fostering innovation and economic expansion. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. This move is part of a broader government effort to create new, tech-focused jobs and build a comprehensive regulatory and industrial framework for the burgeoning drone and air mobility market.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the Washington Open after a 6-4, 6-3 semi-final loss to Anna Kalinskaya. Kalinskaya controlled the match, securing key breaks in both sets and preventing a highly anticipated final between Raducanu and Leylah Fernandez, which would have been a rematch of their 2021 US Open final. In the other semi-final, Fernandez overcame third-seed Elena Rybakina in a marathon three-set thriller that lasted over three hours. Kalinskaya will now face Fernandez in the final, aiming for her first WTA 500 title in what is expected to be a competitive championship match.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport after experiencing a tire-related maintenance issue that resulted in a fire during its takeoff roll. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely evacuated, with some using emergency slides as smoke was visible from under the aircraft. Five people were evaluated for minor injuries at the scene, with one later transported for medical attention. The incident caused a temporary ground stop at the airport, but operations have since returned to normal. The FAA is investigating the event, and the affected passengers were rebooked on a replacement flight.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China is working to recreate the Houfeng Didong Yi, a legendary earthquake-detecting device said to have been invented nearly 2,000 years ago by the polymath Zhang Heng. Historical texts describe the ornate bronze vessel as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter, a feat that has led some modern scholars to dismiss it as a myth. Despite its removal from the Chinese school curriculum in 2017, researchers are now using modern scientific principles and newly discovered clues to build a functional replica. Their goal is to restore the reputation of this ancient invention and demonstrate its sophisticated design.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were trapped inside a tunnel for over six hours due to a power failure. The outage, which occurred shortly after departure, also disabled the air conditioning and lighting, leaving passengers in the dark and heat. The rescue operation was prolonged when some passengers exited the replacement train and began walking in the tunnel, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety. Eventually, all passengers were evacuated through emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two individuals receiving on-site medical treatment but no serious injuries reported.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with a special event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of two new commemorative stamps. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service played a crucial role in unifying the young nation. The new stamps feature Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, and depictions of a postal worker through the seasons. The celebration occurs amid recent discussions about the agency's future, including past suggestions of privatization. However, the new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has affirmed his belief that the USPS should not be privatized.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, avoiding a worst-case scenario. Judge, who leads the major leagues in batting average and OPS, received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 days to two weeks. He first felt pain after making a strong throw during a game against Toronto. While the injury is a setback for the team, both Judge and manager Aaron Boone expressed relief that it was not more serious, with hopes he can return initially as a designated hitter.</p>

          <p>A retrospective article examines the legacy of "The Osbournes," the early 2000s MTV show that transformed Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne into a beloved reality TV father and pioneered the "reality sitcom" genre. Before shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians," the series captivated audiences by blending the family's rock-star fame with mundane domestic life, from Ozzy struggling with a TV remote to family squabbles. Producers and television critics note that the show's success lay in its authentic, often chaotic portrayal of a family that genuinely loved each other. It set the stage for a wave of celebrity-driven reality programming that continues to dominate television today.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official from Goma, DR Congo, is being considered for Catholic sainthood after he was murdered in 2007 for refusing bribes. A devout Catholic, Kositi blocked a shipment of spoiled rice that could have poisoned the public, rejecting increasingly large sums of money from smugglers. His "mafia-style" killing was intended as a warning, but his legacy of integrity has endured. The Catholic Church has declared him a martyr and beatified him, a significant step toward canonization. His story is now held up as an example of choosing honesty and Christian values over the "filth of corruption."</p>

          <p>With England in the Euro 2025 final, an article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during high-stakes matches and offers advice on how to cope. Psychologists explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, causing increased heart rates and anxiety, a biological response to being highly invested in the outcome. To manage this stress, experts suggest getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, eating well, and avoiding alcohol. They also recommend reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, communal experience, emphasizing that sport provides a healthy outlet for expressing powerful emotions and feeling part of something larger.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to pass the mid-60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west than usual, allowing a low-pressure system to dominate the region with persistent cloud cover. This pattern has also increased coastal upwelling, where strong winds bring colder deep-ocean water to the surface, further cooling the air. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, forecasters caution that the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>

The performance was praised for its energetic Motown medley, the tight musicianship of her large backing band, and her dazzling wardrobe changes. Amusing moments included Ross publicly calling out a sound engineer for a hot mic and her daughter Rhonda joining her on stage for a song. The show celebrated her entire career, from Supremes hits and her role in "The Wiz" to material from her 2021 album, "Thank You."

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to shield pubs and live music venues from closure due to noise complaints from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing the new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new bars in vacant shops and encourage outdoor dining and performances to bring "vibrancy" back to town centers. While the government touts the changes as a boost for the struggling hospitality industry, the opposition has criticized the move as hypocritical, blaming the government's own tax policies for the sector's economic pressures.
