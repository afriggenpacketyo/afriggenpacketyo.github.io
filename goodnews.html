          <p>Sly Stone, the iconic frontman of Sly and the Family Stone, has died at 82 after battling COPD and other health issues. Stone's family highlighted his monumental influence on pop, funk, and rock music, noting his songs have left an indelible mark on the world. Stone recently completed a screenplay for his life story and released a memoir in 2023 titled "Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)," detailing his revolutionary music style and struggles with addiction. Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson praised Stone for his musical innovation and for uplifting women in the music industry, a rare practice at the time. The group's compositions, penned by Stone, earned the band a Grammy Hall of Fame induction and a spot on the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's "500 Songs That Shaped Rock."</p>

          <p>A mother, Mary Schubart, discovered that mattress pads she purchased from Pottery Barn Teen, advertised as "crafted in the USA," were actually made in China. Schubart reported her findings to Truth in Advertising, a nonprofit watchdog group, leading to an investigation of false claims by Pottery Barn Teen. The investigation resulted in the largest "Made in the USA" civil penalty in history, with Williams Sonoma, the parent company, fined over $3 million. The FTC requires that products labeled "Made in the USA" be manufactured domestically with U.S.-sourced components, advising consumers to check labels carefully for qualifying language such as "Assembled in the USA" or "with imported parts."</p>

The lawsuit included a defamation claim against The New York Times, which was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers called the dismissal a "total victory and complete vindication" and plan to seek attorneys' fees, treble damages, and punitive damages against Baldoni. The case stemmed from Lively's complaint accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment on the set of their film, "It Ends With Us," which Baldoni denied.</p>

          <p>A Ramsay Solutions study of 10,000 millionaires reveals that most respondents (79%) did not inherit a fortune and one-third never earned a six-figure salary in any single year. Investing small amounts consistently can lead to significant wealth accumulation through the power of compounding interest. Putting $100 per month into a Roth IRA with a 12% average annual return can result in over $1 million by age 62. The magic of compound interest, especially when combined with disciplined savings habits, is key to achieving millionaire status, even without a high income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Clean Energy Transition Hinges on Critical Minerals</h2>

          <p>The global clean energy transition is heavily reliant on critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper, which are essential for producing renewable energy technologies. Demand for these minerals is projected to surge in the coming decades, potentially leading to supply chain bottlenecks and geopolitical tensions. The United States is a major consumer of critical minerals but not a significant producer, prompting efforts to increase domestic production. Scientists are also exploring alternative materials and more efficient mining practices to mitigate the challenges associated with critical mineral constraints. (not investment advice)</p>
