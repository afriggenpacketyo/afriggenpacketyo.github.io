        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Toronto, Canada, suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including depressive symptoms. Researchers analyzed nearly 29,000 adults and found that those on calorie-restrictive diets, even overweight individuals, experienced an increase in depressive symptom severity. Nutrient-restricted diets showed an even larger increase in symptoms, while men on any diet reported higher somatic symptom scores. While weight loss is about calories in and calories out, it‚Äôs also about the type of calories and what we need for fuel, protection against disease, and mental and physical satisfaction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a resurgence in uranium mining due to skyrocketing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. Despite being the world's largest producer of nuclear power, the U.S. imports over 95% of its uranium, creating a policy incongruence. The Biden administration banned Russian uranium imports and unlocked $2.7 billion to expand domestic enrichment capacity, while President Trump signed executive orders to quadruple nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Experts note that even with increased domestic production, the U.S. will continue to rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves.</p>

          <p>Meta is suing Joy Timeline HK Limited, the developer of the CrushAI app, for running ads on Facebook and Instagram that create non-consensual, sexualized images of others using AI technology. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent Joy Timeline from advertising on Meta's platforms after multiple attempts to circumvent Meta's ad review process. Senator Dick Durbin criticized Meta for allowing CrushAI-related ads that violate Meta's standards on adult nudity and harassment. Meta is updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove such ads, sharing signals with other tech companies to address the apps across platforms.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation eased to a lower-than-expected 2.82% in May, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. This year-on-year headline inflation is the lowest since February 2019, falling below Reuters' median poll estimate of 3%. Food inflation, a key metric, dropped to 0.99% in May, significantly below April's 1.78%, with vegetable inflation dipping by 13.7%. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, recently slashing its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Some parents are actively trying to delay their daughters' first periods due to concerns about the trend of earlier menarche and associated health risks. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, from 12.5 between 1950 and 1969 to 11.9 between 2000 and 2005. Parents are making changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time, focusing on eliminating chemicals called endocrine disruptors, which can mimic the activity of hormones in the body. Experts say limiting exposure to endocrine disruptors is reasonable, but it's impossible to avoid them completely, and some worry about unintended consequences like eating disorders.</p>

Despite her scoring feats, Bueckers expressed that she could have played better, citing the need to use her voice more, be more disruptive, and crash the glass more.
