        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares rise over 11% in its Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, reportedly the largest global listing in 2025. The funds are allocated to building a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL's global expansion coincides with similar moves by Chinese EV makers, though tariffs imposed by the U.S. and EU have presented challenges. The company posted a 9.7% drop in its 2024 annual revenue due to intense competition in China's EV market, despite a 15% increase in net profit.</p>

          <p>Special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs) are making a comeback, particularly those involving individuals in President Trump's circle and investments related to cryptocurrency. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are pitching a SPAC focused on crypto, while another is backed by an adviser to Saudi Arabia. The return of SPACs is driven by a rising stock market, strong demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains. However, many past SPAC deals have failed, leading to SEC investigations and investor losses, making these investments speculative. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. This move aims to stimulate the economy amid concerns that trade tensions could hinder growth. The rate cuts followed actions by state-backed commercial lenders to decrease deposit rates, which supports lower lending rates. The stimulus package includes reductions to lending rates and the reserve requirements for banks. Despite trade-war fears, global investment banks have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth, though caution remains due to deflationary pressures and potential tariff increases.</p>

The administration had halted the project over concerns about rushed permits, but the decision was met with criticism and warnings of potential cancellation.

          <p>Fiber is crucial for managing diabetes by minimizing blood sugar spikes, and chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries, and avocados are excellent high-fiber options.

Chickpeas offer fiber and protein, while chia seeds are a fiber powerhouse that can reduce blood pressure. Edamame is rich in protein and fiber, and raspberries have been linked to improved glucose handling. Avocados provide healthy fats and fiber, contributing to heart health and slow digestion.
