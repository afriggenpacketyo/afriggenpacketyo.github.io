          <h2>Training Program Aims to Reduce 'Elderspeak' and Improve Care for Older Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 07:34:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new training program called CHAT (Changing Talk) is designed to reduce the use of 'elderspeak,' a form of communication resembling baby talk often used with older adults, which can convey assumptions of frailty and incompetence. Studies have shown that elderspeak is common in nursing homes and can lead to resistance to care among residents with dementia. The CHAT program, involving videos and discussions, has proven effective in reducing elderspeak and resistant behaviors, and is now being adapted for online use. The article emphasizes the importance of respectful communication and addressing older adults as adults.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Albanese of Australia's center-left Labor Party has won a second term as Prime Minister, overcoming earlier poll deficits due to cost-of-living concerns. Voters opted for the known quantity of Albanese amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. The conservative opposition, led by Peter Dutton, faced a significant defeat, even with dissatisfaction regarding the status quo, partly due to campaign missteps and association with Trump's policies. The election outcome reflects a disaffection with major parties, especially among younger voters, who seek bolder solutions for national challenges.</p>

The experience underscored the strength of society when people choose joy and collaboration over fear in the face of adversity.</p>

          <p>Despite the widespread use of antidepressants, many questions remain about their long-term effects and safe withdrawal. While acknowledging their benefits for some, the article highlights the lack of high-quality research on tapering off antidepressants and the potential for severe withdrawal symptoms. It criticizes the medical community's limited engagement with patients' concerns and calls for more research into the long-term use of these medications. The author urges the medical establishment to address these issues with scientific transparency and humility, rather than dismissing patients' experiences.</p>

          <p>Following significant gains in local elections, Reform UK now controls several councils and has new mayors.

Reform also intends to resist central government placement of asylum seekers in their areas. Despite inexperience among newly-elected councillors, Reform's deputy leader emphasizes common sense and the party plans to train new councillors at its Centre for Excellence.</p>

          <p>A Member of Parliament is advocating for a reevaluation of the ban on alcohol consumption in football stands, citing the need for a "modern approach." Current legislation prohibits fans from drinking alcohol in view of the pitch in the top five tiers of English men's football. The MP suggests that trials should be conducted to assess the impact of lifting the restrictions, drawing comparisons to other sports and European football leagues. The Football Supporters Association supports the call for trials and a discussion on the issue.</p>
