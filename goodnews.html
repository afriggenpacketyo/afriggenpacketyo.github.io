          <h2>First Alzheimer's Blood Test Set to Launch in the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:51:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first blood test designed to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is set to become available in the United States starting in late June, following regulatory clearance from the FDA. Developed by Fujirebio Holdings, the test detects amyloid, a protein that accumulates in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's. This new test offers a less expensive and less invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to diagnosis and treatment for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by Alzheimer's. The test will initially be available at around 50 American research institutes and hospitals that specialize in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public criticism of his remarks about never having to buy rice because he receives it as gifts from supporters. His comments were particularly ill-timed, as Japan is grappling with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and protectionist policies. Eto's resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro has been appointed as Eto's successor. The incident highlights public discontent with the government's handling of rising food prices and economic issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Numerous articles and podcasts suggest that young men are fueling the rise of the far right, but this media focus overlooks a more significant shift in public opinion among young people. Research indicates that young women are increasingly turning towards the left, holding more progressive values than previous generations. This shift is evident in their greater support for abortion rights, feminism, environmental protection, and redistribution policies. Centre-left parties are missing a political opportunity by chasing an outdated interpretation of the "working-class" voter instead of focusing on the priorities and values of female voters.</p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young workers seek an alternative to the hypercompetitive work culture of coastal megacities. Often ridiculed for its slow-paced lifestyle, Chengdu is now attracting those disillusioned with the intense pressure and high cost of living in cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen. The city's population has grown by 30% in the last five years, and housing prices have risen faster than in any other major Chinese city. Chengdu's thriving entertainment sector, vibrant LGBTQ community, and embrace of art and counterculture contribute to its appeal.</p>

          <p>The European Union is providing ‚Ç¨5.5 million in emergency funding to support Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) after the Trump administration suspended US public funding. The US administration accused the broadcaster of promoting a news agenda with liberal bias. EU Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas said the funding would act as a "safety net for independent journalism" and would focus on countries in regions such as Central Asia and the Caucasus.
