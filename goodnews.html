          <p>Adelita Grijalva is projected to win the special election for Arizona's seventh congressional district, filling the seat held for over two decades by her late father, Congressman Raúl Grijalva. A longtime local official, Grijalva successfully defended her political record against challengers who criticized her "legacy last name." As a progressive Democrat, she will be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress, and her victory narrows the Republican majority in the House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN, President Donald Trump has dramatically shifted his position on the war in Ukraine. Trump stated on social media that he now believes Ukraine is capable of winning back all of its territory, citing Russia's struggling economy as a key factor. This marks a significant departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would need to cede territory to achieve peace, a pivot Zelenskyy described as a "big shift."</p>

          <p>According to a study by Oxford Economics, the activities of YouTube content creators contributed £2.2 billion to the UK's economy and supported 45,000 jobs in 2024. This economic impact has prompted the launch of an all-party parliamentary group to better represent the interests of creators and influencers, who have often felt undervalued by policymakers. The new group aims to address challenges faced by creators, such as access to funding and navigating regulations, to help the sector grow further.</p>

          <p>A new report from Tsinghua University and Deloitte indicates that China's implementation of a visa-free policy has significantly boosted the international influence of Beijing and Shanghai. The policy led to a surge in tourist arrivals, which, combined with improved transportation, helped Beijing climb to sixth place and Shanghai to eighth on the 2025 International Exchange Centres Index. This growth highlights the positive economic and cultural impact of easing travel restrictions for foreign visitors to China's major urban centers.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Barbara Kingsolver has used royalties from her bestselling novel, "Demon Copperhead," to establish a recovery residence for women battling addiction in Appalachia. The home, named Higher Ground, provides a supportive living environment for women re-entering the community after treatment or incarceration in a region heavily impacted by the opioid crisis.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City voters are considering a proposal to move municipal elections, including the mayoral race, from odd-numbered years to even-numbered years to coincide with federal and state contests. Proponents argue that consolidating elections would significantly increase voter turnout, which is often extremely low for local races, and create a more diverse electorate. This potential change is part of a growing national trend, though some officials express concern that local issues could be overshadowed by larger political races.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the history of the word "spicy" and the profound impact spices have had on global history, from ancient trade to modern culinary trends like the pumpkin spice latte. Originally meaning "containing spice," the term evolved by the 19th century to describe anything provocative or tantalizing. For millennia, exotic spices like cinnamon and pepper were highly valued commodities, driving exploration, conquest, and the establishment of global trade empires, while also being associated with wealth, holiness, and medicine.</p>
