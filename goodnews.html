          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' estimates, indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite this, industrial output grew by 6.1%, surpassing expectations, while fixed-asset investment saw a slight decrease. The real estate sector continued to struggle, with a significant drop in fixed asset investment. The urban unemployment rate decreased slightly to 5.1%, and the data emerges against the backdrop of trade tensions between China and the U.S., though recent talks have eased some of these fears.

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, baffling scientists due to its unusual symmetry and lack of X-ray emissions. Named Teleios, the object is believed to be a supernova remnant, but its distance remains uncertain, leading to different interpretations of its size and age. Researchers are considering various scenarios, including a Type Iax supernova, but none fully explain Teleios's properties. Further observations are needed to unravel the mystery of this unique celestial object.</p>

The election followed political turbulence and unhappiness with mainstream parties, with Simion attacking the EU and calling for aid cuts to Kyiv.</p>
