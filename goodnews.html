Cisco also highlighted its growing involvement in AI infrastructure, noting that related orders for the 2025 fiscal year exceeded $2 billion, doubling its internal goal and signaling confidence in the trend's longevity.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is projected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by the end of the week. The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, is currently moving westward with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. While it does not pose an immediate threat to the United States, early models suggest it could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands.

          <p>In a significant act of cooperation with the Trump administration, Mexico has transferred 26 high-ranking cartel members to U.S. custody to face justice. The group includes prominent figures such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the "Los Cuinis" group allied with the CJNG cartel, and Servando Gómez Martinez, former head of the Knights Templar cartel. This move comes amid increasing pressure from the U.S. for Mexico to crack down on drug trafficking and fentanyl production.

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen a dramatic increase in their franchise valuation, now estimated at $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL behind the Dallas Cowboys. This marks a significant turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at just $930 million. The surge is largely attributed to their return to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium, a vision of owner Stan Kroenke. This valuation reflects the team's success in monetizing the venue and building strong fan and corporate bases in a major market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A California Court of Appeals has denied rapper Tory Lanez's request to submit new evidence in his case concerning the 2020 shooting of Megan Thee Stallion. Lanez, who is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence, sought to introduce a new statement from a security guard and challenge the fact that his driver did not testify. This is the latest failed attempt by Lanez to overturn his 2022 felony conviction for assault with a firearm and other charges. His legal team had previously argued for a new trial in May 2023, which was also rejected by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of Comedy Central's "South Park" is experiencing a significant ratings surge, with its second episode drawing 6.2 million viewers, the highest since 2018. The show's renewed popularity is being attributed to its sharp satirical takes on political figures, including President Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The episode lampooned Trump's recent settlement with Paramount and portrayed Noem with a melting face and a penchant for shooting dogs. This success comes amid tensions between Paramount and the White House, yet the show's creators have not shied away from provocative political comedy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has named country star George Strait, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, the band Kiss, and performer Michael Crawford as this year's Kennedy Center Honorees. In a significant move, Trump also announced that he will host the awards gala, a departure from his first term when he avoided the event. He asserted his direct involvement in the selection process and promised a complete renovation of the Kennedy Center to restore its prestige. This follows Trump's recent actions to replace the center's board of trustees with his own appointees, signaling a more hands-on approach to the cultural institution.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the parent company of the payment app Zelle, for allegedly failing to implement adequate security measures. The lawsuit claims these failures allowed fraudsters to steal over $1 billion from consumers between 2017 and 2023. The complaint alleges that Zelle's design, including a quick registration process and lack of verification, made it a prime target for scams, and that EWS knew of these vulnerabilities but failed to act. Zelle has dismissed the lawsuit as a "political stunt" and a copy of a previously dismissed federal case.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sign 18-year-old Italian defender Giovanni Leoni from Parma for a fee of approximately £26 million. The promising center-back has become a primary target for the Premier League club as it looks to strengthen its defensive lineup. In addition to Leoni, Liverpool remains in discussions with Crystal Palace for England international Marc Guehi, although the clubs are still negotiating the transfer fee. These potential acquisitions would significantly increase Liverpool's summer spending as they aim to build a competitive squad for the upcoming season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, while some of the market's largest tech companies saw a decline. This rotation is being driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowing for operations and expansion, and could also stimulate consumer spending. Traders are now pricing in a nearly 100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, a sentiment fueled by recent economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

Previously, the discount applied mainly to fresh produce and general merchandise outside of the holiday season. The expanded benefit is one of the most requested by employees and could also serve to boost worker retention and encourage staff to do more of their own shopping at Walmart.</p>
