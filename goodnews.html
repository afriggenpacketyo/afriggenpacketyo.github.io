          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her unfair dismissal case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with the court determining she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. Lattouf claimed the ABC cut short her fill-in radio presenting stint due to her political views, race, and lobbying from pro-Israel groups, after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The court awarded her A$70,000 in damages, finding the ABC sacked her for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, while dismissing allegations of racial discrimination. The ABC apologized for its handling of the matter, acknowledging it had let down its staff and audiences, as Lattouf stated she was punished for her political opinion.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, suggested that the leak of an initial intelligence assessment regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities following U.S. strikes was "treasonous." The assessment, reportedly from the U.S. Central Command and the Defense Intelligence Agency, concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, stating that no one is shooting at each other and the conflict is over. He also dismissed the possibility of Iran resuming its nuclear enrichment program within months.</p>

          <p>California's Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funding, while reducing and delaying proposed cuts. The agreement includes a "poison pill" requiring legislators to pass a bill lessening environmental review requirements for building projects under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget also preserves funding for Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention grants, and expands the California Film and Television Tax Credit, while anticipating future financial challenges and potential federal funding losses.</p>

Recent moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and gathering feedback on allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and a relatively opaque system have discouraged large-scale buying of mainland China assets.

Mamdani's victory is viewed as a litmus test for the Democratic Party as it seeks to refine its messaging after recent election losses. The former governor's loss is considered the "biggest upset in modern NYC history," with Mamdani potentially becoming the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of the city.</p>

Greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen by over half since 1990, mainly due to the shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle (EV) charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction to the states, led by attorneys general in California, Colorado, and Washington, ruling that their lawsuit would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who oversaw the hush-money case against Donald Trump, won the Democratic primary as he seeks reelection. Bragg defeated Patrick Timmins and will face Republican Maud Maron in the general election. Bragg's tenure had a rocky start, but he gained prominence for prosecuting Trump, leading to the former president's conviction on felony counts of falsifying business records. Bragg's campaign emphasized his efforts to fight gun violence, help sexual assault survivors, and prosecute hate crimes, while his office has been involved in several high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart is set to play the coveted "legends" slot at Glastonbury, though he wishes it wasn't called the "tea time slot." He has secured an hour-and-a-half set and plans to perform as many songs as possible.

          <h2>Study Finds Stars Born Today Spin Faster Than Those Formed Billions of Years Ago</h2>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope. Researchers at the Changchun Observatory studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older counterparts. This extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study presents direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time, offering a new way to study the Milky Way‚Äôs history.</p>
