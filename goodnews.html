          <p>Washington H. Soul Pattinson and Brickworks, two Australian investment firms, have announced a merger valued at A$14 billion ($9 billion), leading to a surge in their stock prices. The merger aims to create a new, larger company listed in Sydney, consolidating holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit. According to Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow, the deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and enhances the company's investment profile. This move unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers but criticized for suppressing shareholder value and corporate transparency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Students are being warned of potential subject "cold spots" as universities cut courses, prompting concerns about limited educational opportunities in certain regions. A government review of higher education funding is underway in England, with a report suggesting greater collaboration between universities to address cost-cutting pressures. The Competition and Markets Authority supports collaboration where possible in the challenging financial situation for the sector. Some universities are already delivering courses in collaboration, benefiting students, and increased clarity is needed to prevent isolated decisions about course closures.</p>
