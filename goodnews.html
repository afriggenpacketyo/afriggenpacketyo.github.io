          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, marking its most significant revenue growth since late 2021. The company saw a 10% overall revenue increase, driven by a 13% rise in iPhone sales. While Mac and Services divisions also grew, iPad and wearables sales declined. Notably, sales in China reversed a downward trend, which CEO Tim Cook partially attributed to a government subsidy program. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to construct a 90,000-square-foot ballroom in the White House's East Wing. The new venue, with a seating capacity of 650, is intended to eliminate the need for temporary tents for large events like state dinners. The estimated $200 million cost will be funded by President Trump and other private donors, with construction slated to begin in September. The project involves replacing the current East Wing with a structure designed to match the White House's architectural heritage.</p>

          <p>The new sequel to "The Naked Gun" is praised as a surprisingly effective and hilarious revival of the classic comedy franchise. The article commends the film for faithfully adhering to the absurd, deadpan humor of the original series while finding a worthy successor to Leslie Nielsen in Liam Neeson. Neeson is celebrated for his unexpectedly entertaining performance as Frank Drebin Jr., skillfully handling both wordplay and physical comedy. The film is positioned as a successful delivery of irreverent fun and nostalgia for audiences.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, with 250 remaining to protect federal property. The troops were initially deployed by the Trump administration two months ago to manage protests related to federal immigration policies. The deployment was met with resistance from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass, who argued it was unnecessary. The withdrawal was praised by local politicians, who are continuing to push for the removal of all remaining troops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has overturned a controversial law that would have limited the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after thousands of young Ukrainians participated in the largest anti-government demonstrations since Russia's full-scale invasion. Protesters argued that safeguarding the autonomy of these agencies was vital for Ukraine's path toward EU membership and maintaining crucial financial support from Western partners. The government's quick U-turn is seen as a victory for civil society, though it has raised some questions about the administration's reform commitments.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the potato's ancestor is, unexpectedly, the tomato. Scientists determined that the modern potato evolved around 9 million years ago through a hybridization event between a non-tuber-producing wild potato species and an ancient tomato. The research shows that the tomato provided a key gene that signals the plant to form tubers. This discovery solves a long-standing puzzle about the origin of the popular vegetable and demonstrates how interbreeding can spark new evolutionary traits.</p>
