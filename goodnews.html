          <p>The winner of the Indianapolis 500 will continue the tradition of drinking milk in the victory circle, a practice that began in 1936 with Louis Meyer drinking buttermilk. The tradition was cemented when a dairy industry executive saw the moment captured on camera and requested milk be given to every winner. While there was a brief period where winners drank cold water, milk returned as an accessory prize and has been enjoyed by 69 consecutive winners, solidifying its place in the race's history.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability, while regulatory developments and endorsements from figures like Jamie Dimon further supported the market.</p>

Children born between January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested in financial markets and could be withdrawn for expenses like college or buying a house.
