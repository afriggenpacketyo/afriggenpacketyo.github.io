          <p>JPMorgan Chase will now allow its clients to buy Bitcoin, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's continued skepticism towards the cryptocurrency. While JPMorgan will not custody Bitcoin, it will include it in client statements. Dimon cited concerns about money laundering, lack of ownership clarity, sex trafficking, and terrorism associated with Bitcoin. The article notes this decision marks a significant step for the largest U.S. bank and is the latest sign of Bitcoin's entry into mainstream investing. Since August, Morgan Stanley has allowed its financial advisors to pitch some spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to qualifying clients.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga and Cocoteros off the coast of Gabon legally belong to Equatorial Guinea, settling a decades-long dispute. The three tiny islands, which are effectively uninhabited but are located in potentially oil and gas-rich waters, have been controlled by Gabon since its troops forcibly evicted Equatorial Guinean soldiers from Mbanie in 1972. The court ordered Gabon to acknowledge a treaty signed in Paris in 1900 dividing up French and Spanish colonial assets in the region which handed the islands to Spain, with sovereignty passing to Equatorial Guinea upon its independence from Madrid in 1968.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is phasing out the E-3 AWACS (Airborne Warning and Control System) due to its aging Boeing 707 airframe and the increasing cost of maintenance. The AWACS, known for its enormous rotating radar dish, has been a staple of American airpower since the 1970s. The article mentions that the Air Force has sent 14 AWACS to the Boneyard, a nickname for Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona, for storage and potential reuse of parts. The E-3 AWACS is now being replaced by the E-7, which uses a modern radar array.</p>

          <p>Morrisons' chief executive Rami Baiti√©h says the UK-EU trade deal will "ease a source of pressure on food prices" by sweeping away trade barriers and reducing costs and delays in food imports. Major business groups have called the agreement a "leap forward" which made "genuine progress." The article notes that some studies suggest that greater red tape on trade has contributed to higher prices for foodstuffs imported to the UK from the EU in recent years. Price reductions would depend on suppliers passing on savings.</p>
