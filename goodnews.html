          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, is in Washington for talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent regarding transatlantic trade relations. The visit follows a recent agreement where the U.S. set a 15% tariff on most EU exports, a reduction from a previously threatened 30%. Klingbeil has expressed a need for stronger international coordination to protect German industries, particularly the steel sector, and has admitted that the dispute exposed certain weaknesses in current strategies. He aims to clarify critical details of the deal and strengthen economic ties.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, a move intended to de-escalate trade tensions and allow for further negotiations. This decision follows a recent political agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump, which set U.S. tariffs on most EU goods at 15%. The EU stated the pause aims to restore stability and predictability for citizens and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic while a final agreement is worked out.</p>

Citing that the European Union currently consumes 20% of the world's chip supply but only produces about 8%, she stressed the importance of increasing domestic manufacturing for economic resilience and competitiveness. Her remarks were made during a visit to the construction site of Infineon's new €5 billion chip factory in Dresden, which is receiving federal funding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly linked to a 62% jump in screening rates for this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50. The findings are considered promising news as earlier detection improves treatment outcomes. However, experts caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and have not increased equitably across all demographics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts forecast that interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) will likely remain stable through August, as the Federal Reserve holds the federal funds rate steady due to a recent uptick in inflation. While some banks have begun to slightly lower their rates in anticipation of future cuts, the current environment still favors savers. Experts suggest that short-term CDs currently offer the most competitive rates, but also advise savers to compare options and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>Researchers have identified the culprit behind a decade-long epidemic that has killed over 5 billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast. A new study pinpoints a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, found in the sea stars' coelomic fluid, as the cause of the gruesome sea star wasting disease. The discovery solves a long-standing mystery and offers hope for intervention, such as breeding resistant populations. The die-off has had severe ecological consequences, leading to an explosion of sea urchins that have decimated vital kelp forests.</p>

          <p>Everton has reached an agreement with Chelsea to sign midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for a fee of around £28 million. The 26-year-old, who joined Chelsea from Leicester City in 2024, had reportedly been reluctant to leave but was open to a move after playing a supporting role last season. The sale is part of Chelsea's effort to trim its squad and recoup funds, with several other players also in negotiations to be sold. Dewsbury-Hall is now set to finalize personal terms and undergo a medical with Everton.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased a car using finance in the last 18 years could be eligible for compensation due to hidden commissions. A recent Supreme Court ruling found that the failure by dealers to properly disclose certain commission arrangements was unfair and therefore unlawful. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is now developing a compensation scheme, expected to launch in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme rather than using claims companies, which charge a fee. (not investment advice)</p>
