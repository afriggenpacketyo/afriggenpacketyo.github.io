          <p>A relationship expert suggests couples can improve their relationships by creating a "relationship bank account." This involves making "deposits" through actions that prioritize the other person's happiness, aiming to build a positive balance that helps manage conflicts. A positive balance signifies emotional security, enabling couples to handle disagreements with minimal conflict, while a negative balance can lead to escalating fights. The goal is to increase deposits over withdrawals, reducing the intensity and frequency of arguments, by identifying and acting on what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated.</p>

The government has announced the cash injection in a bid to kickstart investment in a new nuclear plant, but the Sizewell C project has faced opposition over its potential cost and environmental impact.</p>

Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will get the payment this winter. (not investment advice)</p>
