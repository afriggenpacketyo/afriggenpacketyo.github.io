          <p>In a recent interview, United CEO Scott Kirby discussed air traffic control issues at Newark International Airport, emphasizing the safety measures in place, including backup procedures and pilot training. Kirby acknowledged customer concerns regarding safety and the potential impact of economic factors like tariffs on the travel industry. United has proactively reduced flights to accommodate airport capacity and maintain on-time arrivals. The CEO expressed optimism about upgrading the air traffic control system and assured the public that safety remains the top priority, despite potential financial impacts.

          <p>Patricia Clarkson stars in "Lilly," a film about Lilly Ledbetter's fight for equal pay, inspired by the real-life activist's experiences at Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. Clarkson portrays Ledbetter's journey, highlighting the misogyny and ageism she faced while advocating for fair compensation. Ledbetter's case led to the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which President Obama signed in 2009, effectively ending the statute of limitations on fair-pay claims. Clarkson emphasizes the universal themes of struggle and injustice, finding inspiration in her own mother's activism and connecting with the character's resilience.</p>

          <p>A group of Quakers are marching over 300 miles from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. The march is rooted in the Quaker tradition of peaceful activism, advocating for justice and peace. Organizers aim to show solidarity with migrants and other targeted groups, delivering the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document promoting religious freedom. They believe the document's call for inclusivity remains relevant today, as they decry what they view as the administration's disregard for constitutional law and human dignity.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that the UK will end the recruitment of care workers from abroad in an effort to reduce net migration. The government aims to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for overseas workers already in the country. This measure is expected to decrease lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The government plans to raise the threshold for skilled visas and narrow exceptions for temporary shortage visas, while also implementing training commitments to reintegrate unemployed individuals into the UK labor market.</p>

This incident follows a similar occurrence in October 2023, where a Chinese research vessel was detected conducting suspicious maneuvers in the same area.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar as a gift for use as Air Force One until shortly before Trump leaves office. Ownership of the plane would then be transferred to the Trump presidential library foundation. This unprecedented arrangement is expected to raise legal questions, but lawyers for the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice are said to have concluded that it is legally permissible. The Air Force would modify the 13-year-old aircraft and transfer it to the foundation by January 1, 2029.</p>

          <p>This article tells the story of Andy Hill, a former UCLA basketball player who created the plus-minus statistic, originally called the Team Contribution Index. Hill's inspiration came from trying to quantify the value of players who contributed to winning in ways that weren't reflected in traditional statistics. While Hill acknowledges its limitations, the plus-minus stat has become widely used in basketball to assess a player's impact on the team's performance. The concept reflects the importance of teamwork and doing the little things right, which Hill learned from his coach John Wooden.</p>
