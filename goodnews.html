          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese achieved a significant victory, securing a second consecutive term after defying low approval ratings earlier in the year. Albanese's center-left Labor Party increased its majority, marking the first time in over two decades that an Australian prime minister has won back-to-back elections. The campaign focused on cost-of-living concerns, healthcare affordability, and climate change, with Albanese emphasizing fairness and opportunity. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's shortcomings and the need for rebuilding after a campaign marred by missteps and confusion.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett cautioned against using trade as a weapon, criticizing President Trump's tariff policies during Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting. Buffett emphasized the importance of balanced trade but disagreed with Trump's approach, advocating for global cooperation and prosperity. Despite concerns about tariffs, Buffett remains optimistic about the United States' long-term prospects, stating that America should trade with the rest of the world, focusing on its strengths while allowing other countries to do the same. Shareholders also sought insights into Berkshire's substantial cash reserves, with Buffett indicating a lack of attractively priced investments.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to return to the airwaves after a federal appeals court temporarily halted an executive order by former President Trump that aimed to dismantle the broadcaster. The ruling allows VoA staff to gradually return to the office and resume programming. However, the court's decision is less favorable for other publicly funded broadcasters, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, as the freeze on their funds remains in place. The USAGA, which oversees VoA and other foreign-news broadcasters, has traditionally enjoyed bipartisan support due to its role in promoting democracy and U.S. interests.</p>

          <p>Several German states are considering banning smartphones from classrooms, with one high school already trialing the initiative to reduce distractions and promote interaction among students. The pilot program requires students to keep their phones turned off in their bags during the school day, leading to increased communication and engagement. While some teachers support the ban, citing improved focus and reduced cyberbullying, others express concerns that it is unrealistic and that students should learn responsible smartphone use. Research suggests that smartphone bans can enhance social wellbeing and reduce cyberbullying.</p>

          <p>A man who injected himself with snake venom for years may hold the key to revolutionizing snakebite treatment. Immunologist Jacob Glanville studied Tim Friede, who built immunity to neurotoxins by injecting himself with snake venom. Glanville and his team isolated antibodies from Friede's blood and created an antivenom effective against 19 species of venomous snakes in mice. The antivenom combines two antibodies and a small-molecule drug, offering potential for a more effective and safer treatment than traditional antivenoms. Experts believe that this approach could transform snakebite treatment if approved for clinical use.</p>
