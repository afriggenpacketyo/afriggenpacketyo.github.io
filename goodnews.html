          <p>A Consumer Reports investigation revealed that Kroger shoppers are frequently overcharged for items marked on sale due to expired discount tags. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, found errors on over 150 grocery items, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. Kroger disputes the findings, claiming the errors represent only a small fraction of annual transactions, while analysts suggest the issue could damage consumer trust. The overcharging problem is not unique to Kroger, as retailers like Walmart and Albertsons have faced similar allegations.</p>
