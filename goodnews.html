        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key lending rates by 10 basis points and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points in an effort to bolster economic growth. This move comes as trade worries intensify, with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng scheduled to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to address tariff and trade matters. The announcement signals a proactive approach by Beijing to stabilize its economy amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, at the White House, a stark contrast to his previous rhetoric about Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, despite having recently suggested that he would like to absorb Canada into the U.S. as the 51st state. Carney firmly rejected the idea of Canada being for sale, emphasizing the importance of partnership between the two nations, while Trump addressed a range of topics, including the construction of Barack Obama‚Äôs presidential library and diplomacy with the Houthis in Yemen.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a leading aluminium producer and consumer, may soon reduce its dependence on imported bauxite, the high-quality aluminium ore, thanks to French technology. A plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with IB2 technology to process China's low-grade, high-silica bauxite, previously unusable in the Bayer process. This innovation, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing the refining of low-grade bauxite into high-quality alumina, which aligns with Beijing's push for a greener aluminium industry.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney asserted that Canada is "not for sale" during a meeting with President Trump, who had romanticized the idea of Canada joining the U.S. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, despite Canada's repeated rejection of the concept. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership while rejecting Trump's suggestion of a "wonderful marriage" between the two countries. Despite tensions on trade and borders, Carney pledged to stand firm against the U.S. president and requested that Trump stop referring to Canada as the 51st state.</p>

          <p>The British government is introducing a new law to criminalize the climbing of Winston Churchill's statue in Parliament Square, as well as other war memorials across the country. Offenders could face up to three months in prison and a ¬£1,000 fine for desecrating the monument to Britain's wartime leader. The move comes after the statue has been targeted by demonstrators in recent years, including during Black Lives Matter protests and trans rights campaigns. The government aims to ensure the statue is treated with the respect it deserves, along with other sacred war memorials.</p>
