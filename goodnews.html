          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris topped the timesheets in Friday practice for the Austrian Grand Prix, finishing just ahead of his teammate Oscar Piastri. Max Verstappen of Red Bull was third quickest, as the top teams all introduced significant car upgrades for the weekend. Norris expressed confidence in his car's performance but anticipated a tight qualifying session, expecting rivals like Red Bull to improve significantly. The session also saw an impressive Formula 1 practice debut for 19-year-old Alexander Dunne, who was remarkably close to Piastri's pace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite fears that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. prices have remained relatively stable, with key inflation gauges showing only modest increases. Economists suggest this is due to short-term strategies by companies, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts warn this situation is likely temporary, and consumers may see prices rise in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers with $10,000, choosing between a high-yield savings account and a money market account currently yields very similar returns, as top rates for both are around 4.3%. A calculation shows that over one year, a money market account might earn only about $2 more than a high-yield savings account on a $10,000 deposit, assuming stable rates. Since both offer variable rates that could decline with future interest rate cuts, the choice between them is less about earnings and more about personal preference and features.

          <p>Amid rising consumer debt, debt forgiveness through negotiation is a potential option for relief, particularly for certain types of debt. Unsecured debts like credit card balances, personal loans, and medical bills are often the most likely candidates for settlement, as creditors have no collateral and may prefer to recover a portion of the debt rather than nothing. While buy now, pay later plans and payday loans can technically be settled, they often present more challenges due to their structure and the practices of the lenders involved.

          <p>A review of Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," describes it as a deliberate return to the electronic sound and youthful themes of her earlier work, though filtered through the lens of her late 20s. The album is set in downtown Manhattan and focuses on visceral, personal experiences, but the article argues its potential is diluted by a self-obsession that reflects a broader cultural trend. While moments of the album are praised for their magic and craftsmanship, the overall production is seen as too safe and its intense introspection ultimately circular and isolating.</p>
