          <p>Eighty-year-old Bob Becker has made history as the oldest person to complete the Badwater 135, a grueling 135-mile ultramarathon through California's Death Valley. Despite temperatures around 118 degrees Fahrenheit, Becker ran for 45 hours, ascending three mountain ranges. This was his sixth attempt at the "world's toughest race," having previously missed the official deadline by minutes. His remarkable achievement underscores his enduring dedication to extreme endurance running, which he began in his late 50s.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced over $90 billion in new private investments for Pennsylvania, focusing on artificial intelligence and energy sectors. The announcement came during the Inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick. Projects include new data centers for AI power and an energy innovation center, with Westinghouse planning ten nuclear reactors nationwide. These investments are projected to create tens of thousands of jobs, though some activists protested the summit's emphasis on fossil fuels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the "Genius Act," a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins and potentially integrating them into mainstream payments. This legislation, already passed by the Senate with bipartisan support, is part of the Trump administration's broader push to support the cryptocurrency industry. Stablecoins, designed to be less volatile by pegging their value to assets like the U.S. dollar, could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions. However, risks like "depegging" remain, and major banks like Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are exploring their own stablecoin initiatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, has been awarded $14 million by the L.A. County Board of Supervisors. His conviction in 2001 was based on shaky witness testimony and ignored evidence, including his alibi and a cast he wore at the time of the crime. A judge found him factually innocent in April 2022, leading to this settlement. The case highlights systemic failures in the justice system, but also a measure of accountability and redress for a profound injustice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal mission in Los Angeles, reducing the military presence in the city. These troops were deployed last month, over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, to respond to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests. While the Pentagon cited subsiding "lawlessness" for the withdrawal, Newsom called for the remaining forces to also be returned. The deployment had sparked a national debate about the use of military personnel on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive bill aimed at reforming the U.S. immigration system. Sponsored by Republican Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar and Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar, the legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" to grant legal status to undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S. for at least five years, contingent on background checks, tax payments, and restitution. The bill also includes provisions for enhanced border security, reduced visa backlogs, and expedited asylum processing. This initiative comes amid increasing scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.</p>

          <p>Kew Gardens' iconic Palm House is set to close for five years starting in 2027 for a massive £50 million renovation project. The 175-year-old Victorian glasshouse, home to a tropical rainforest, requires extensive work due to rust and wear from its humid conditions. The ambitious plan includes replacing 16,000 panes of glass, cleaning hundreds of tonnes of ironwork, and upgrading to air and water source heat pumps to achieve net-zero emissions. Horticulturists have already begun the delicate process of relocating 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new tariff deal with Indonesia, stating that the U.S. will lower its threatened tariffs on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump claims American firms will receive "full access" to the Indonesian market. As part of the agreement, Indonesia has also reportedly committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. However, Indonesian officials have not yet confirmed the terms, and the reported figures are lower than those previously anticipated in a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea has commenced a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated President Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family is now fighting to clear his name, arguing he was a patriot who aimed to usher in democracy. The court agreed to the retrial based on new evidence of torture during his original proceedings. This case reopens a deeply polarizing chapter in South Korean history, prompting a re-evaluation of both Kim's motives and Park's authoritarian legacy, especially in light of recent democratic challenges.</p>
