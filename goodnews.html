          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved error-free acoustic data transmission across 600km of ocean, a distance approximating Taipei and Okinawa. The project team, led by Professor He Chengbing at Northwestern Polytechnical University, developed a self-tuning system capable of mapping signal clusters in noisy environments without prior seabed knowledge. This breakthrough, detailed in Acta Acustica, marks significant progress for long-range undersea messaging, potentially impacting both civilian and military applications, especially for tasks requiring high data integrity such as coordinating underwater drones.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed executive orders aimed at revitalizing the American nuclear energy industry. The goal is to expand American nuclear energy capacity from 100 GW today to 400 GW by 2050. The orders seek to expedite testing of new reactor designs, construct reactors on federal land, and reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to shorten licensing timelines. The administration also intends to support domestic uranium mining and enrichment to meet civilian and defense needs.</p>

          <p>Despite backlash against the "defund the police" movement, some cities like Milwaukee, Seattle, and Austin have made strides in reallocating funds to social services and alternative public safety measures. Milwaukee diverted police funding to affordable housing and youth programs, while Seattle created a third public safety department for mental health crises. Austin invested in homeless services, leading to more people being sheltered than unsheltered. These efforts highlight the potential for community-based solutions and a shift in priorities toward social support systems.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that human tooth sensitivity, which causes pain from cold or dental procedures, can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Scientists discovered that the tooth-like scales of ancient fish likely allowed them to sense their surroundings. This ability was inherited by our teeth, which evolved from that armor, allowing us to sense pain and temperature. The findings shed light on skeletal evolution and explain why we experience toothaches.</p>
