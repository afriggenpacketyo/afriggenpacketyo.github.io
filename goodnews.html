        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing the field by over half a second. Norris described the lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying mistakes. The performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension that has improved his confidence behind the wheel. His championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, qualified third, while rival Max Verstappen had a difficult session, qualifying in seventh place for Red Bull.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than 250,000 of its 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential problem with the side curtain airbags. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, improperly sealed seams may prevent the airbags from holding enough pressure during a crash. This could reduce their effectiveness in protecting passengers. The company stated it is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the defect. Dealers will inspect the vehicles and replace the airbags for free if necessary.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's administration. The event was outlawed under a new law restricting gatherings that "promote" homosexuality, but organizers and the city's mayor proceeded, framing it as a municipal event. The march was not only a stand for LGBTQ+ rights but also a protest against what many see as eroding democratic freedoms in Hungary. The massive turnout, supported by numerous EU officials, was viewed as a major demonstration of civil society's strength against the government's policies.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced it will eliminate artificial colors from its entire product line, including brands like Hostess, by the end of 2027. This move follows similar commitments from other major food corporations like Nestle, Conagra, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills. The decision aligns with increased federal scrutiny of synthetic dyes, such as the recent ban on Red 3 due to potential health risks. The company noted that many of its products are already free from these additives, but items like some sugar-free jams and Hostess snack cakes still contain them.</p>

Despite the win and some impressive attacking play, the team faces challenges, including a high penalty count in the first half and a potential injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed some concern over Williams' tight hamstring, which could necessitate calling up a replacement. The performance highlighted both the team's exciting, ambitious style of play and the areas needing improvement as they continue their tour.</p>

The drugs were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. According to the UK's Home Office, this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record. Officials stated that container ships are a primary method used by criminal organizations to smuggle drugs into the UK, which is one of Europe's largest cocaine markets.

          <p>A recent Ukrainian drone strike, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," successfully destroyed or damaged numerous Russian strategic bombers at bases deep inside Russia, fundamentally challenging traditional military doctrine. The operation involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them from close range, bypassing conventional air defenses. This low-cost, high-impact strategy demonstrates that rear-area bases, once considered safe, are now vulnerable. The article argues this playbook could be replicated elsewhere, forcing militaries worldwide to rethink airbase security and accept that their runways are now a new front line in modern warfare.</p>
