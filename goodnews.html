          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing discussions on tariff issues with the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-June, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa. Despite failing to find common ground on tariffs so far, Akazawa believes that progress has been made during talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in Washington. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the Japanese market for American automakers and agricultural products; both sides aim for a mutually beneficial outcome. The leaders of both countries are expected to meet around the time of the Group of Seven summit in Canada to discuss the trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul Japan's rice policy in response to escalating public concerns over soaring rice prices and an upcoming national election. Rice prices have roughly doubled from the previous year, prompting Ishiba to target the country's long-standing production adjustment system, which has been in place for decades. The aim is to counter opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax cut and to boost rice production, although challenges remain, such as the risk of a price plunge due to oversupply. Critics have warned against using rice policy as a political tool, citing potential market turmoil and confusion among consumers.</p>
