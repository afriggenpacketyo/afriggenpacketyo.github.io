          <p>President Trump has announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer prominent in the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next U.S. Surgeon General. Means, a former surgeon turned metabolic health advocate, is expected to work closely with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to address chronic diseases and promote overall health. Means' background includes a medical degree from Stanford and co-founding Levels, a health tracking app, but she is not board-certified in a medical specialty and has expressed controversial views on vaccines and glucose. Her nomination signals a continued focus on alternative health perspectives within the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump is embarking on his first major foreign trip of his second term, prioritizing business deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. This focus comes as his administration faces challenges in brokering peace in Gaza and addressing other regional conflicts. Trump aims to highlight Saudi Arabia's pledge to invest $600 billion in the U.S. and the UAE's commitment to $1.4 trillion in investments. Experts suggest these deals serve to strengthen ties and potentially insulate the Gulf leaders from criticism regarding other sensitive issues, like the ongoing conflict in Gaza.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have developed a close relationship built on mutual respect, trust, and a shared commitment to defending Ukraine's sovereignty against Russian aggression. The two leaders communicate frequently, often bypassing formal diplomatic channels, to discuss strategic matters and offer personal support. Macron's early support for Zelensky's presidency helped to legitimize him on the world stage, and while there have been periods of frustration over the pace of French weapons deliveries, their bond has deepened, particularly after Macron's visit to Kyiv. Macron now serves as an important conduit between Zelensky and other world leaders, including President Trump.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, expressed his delight that the show will, for the first time, be set in Nigeria, specifically in Lagos. Kukoyi, who has been watching Doctor Who since his childhood in the 1980s, was thrilled to see the preview featuring a Lagos marketplace. The episode marks the first time the show has been primarily set in Africa, which is fitting given that nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility in 2013. The episode is expected to showcase Nigerian culture and folklore, with a mysterious character called the Barber and a towering spider.</p>

Experts estimate that the spacecraft, weighing approximately 1,050 pounds and equipped with a protective heat shield, has a good chance of surviving its descent through the atmosphere.
