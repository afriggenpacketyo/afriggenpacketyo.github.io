          <p>At a rally in Des Moines, President Trump celebrated the congressional passage of a massive legislative package he referred to as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." He highlighted that the bill includes what he claims are the largest tax and spending cuts in American history, alongside significant investments in border security. Trump noted the bill passed without any Democratic support, which he plans to use as a talking point in upcoming midterm campaigns. The rally also served as a platform to preview other initiatives for the nation's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has again pledged to tackle the issue of overcapacity and excessive competition within its solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. Industry and Information Technology Minister Li Lecheng stated that "disorderly low-price competition" must be comprehensively addressed through regulation. The goal is to guide companies toward improving product quality and phasing out outdated production capacity to ensure the sector's healthy and sustainable development. This directive follows President Xi Jinping's recent call to remove excess industrial capacity and curb destructive pricing strategies.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom of California is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a state with an early and pivotal presidential primary. This visit is intensifying speculation that he is preparing for a potential 2028 presidential campaign, although his advisors deny this, stating his focus is on the 2026 midterms. Newsom's tour will cover eight of the state's most economically challenged counties, with the stated aim of showing rural voters they are not forgotten by Democrats. This trip follows other actions by Newsom that appear to be aimed at raising his national profile.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have achieved a significant milestone in chimera research by growing a heart structure from human cells inside a pig embryo. The research team from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health reported that the structure developed into a beating heart and survived for 21 days without assistance. To achieve this, the researchers modified human stem cells to improve their viability within the pig embryo before implantation. This breakthrough follows a previous success by the same team in cultivating human kidneys in pigs for a 28-day period.</p>
