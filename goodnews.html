          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) revealed its plan to divide into two distinct publicly traded entities by the middle of 2026, marking a significant shift in the media landscape as consumers increasingly transition from traditional cable to streaming services. The separation will create a streaming and studios company, housing movie properties and HBO Max, alongside a global networks company that includes CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. CEO David Zaslav will lead the streaming and studios company, while current CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels will take the helm of the global networks business, with the aim of optimizing each company's focus and strategic flexibility in the evolving media environment. The move follows similar restructuring efforts by other media giants like Comcast and signals potential consolidation within the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports suggesting that heavy metal pollution in northern Thai rivers is linked to Chinese mining activities in Myanmar, China's embassy in Thailand stated that it is closely monitoring the situation. The embassy acknowledged comments from the Thai government and emphasized that China requires its companies operating overseas to comply with local laws and regulations. The embassy suggested that Thailand and Myanmar collaborate on scientific investigations into the issue and expressed China's willingness to work with Mekong basin countries to protect the region's ecology and water quality. Thailand's Pollution Control Department had previously reported unsafe levels of heavy metals in sediment samples from rivers in northern Thailand, attributing the contamination to upstream mining operations.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to detain and deport immigrants, Chicago is leveraging its established infrastructure and collaborative networks to resist these policies. The city's strategies include Know Your Rights campaigns, rapid-response groups, and community education meetings to inform immigrants of their rights and the latest changes in immigration tactics. Chicago has implemented policies such as the Welcoming City ordinance and the Trust Act to limit cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE, which has been a critical tool for resistance. Volunteer interest in anti-deportation efforts has surged, demonstrating a strong commitment to protecting immigrant communities.</p>

Ono, former president of the University of Michigan, had previously promised to implement "DEI 2.0" and described racism as "one of America‚Äôs original sins." The Florida Board of Governors questioned Ono's commitment to academic excellence and intellectual diversity, particularly his response to anti-Israel protests at the University of Michigan. The decision reflects Florida's stance against what it views as the "woke mind virus" in higher education and a commitment to rejecting ideological capture.</p>

          <p>NPR provides five simple and cost-effective tips to reduce home energy consumption, emphasizing that energy-efficient homes involve minimizing heat gain during hot months and heat loss during cold months. The suggestions include opening windows for natural ventilation, utilizing ceiling fans to circulate air, making roofs reflective to deflect sunlight, installing exterior shades to block heat, and sealing air leaks around windows and doors. Implementing these solutions can significantly reduce climate pollution, enhance home resilience to global warming, and lower energy bills; using natural ventilation can translate into energy savings of up to 45% depending on the local climate.</p>

Despite President Trump's pledge to promote excellence at HBCUs, funding cuts to institutions like Howard University have raised concerns about sustainability. Tuskegee University President Mark Brown emphasizes that HBCUs are merit-based schools open to all qualified applicants, and not DEI-focused institutions. He highlights the potential impact of policy changes on student access to federal financial aid, which is crucial for many HBCU students, and stresses the importance of HBCUs as economic engines for social and economic mobility.</p>

The proposal would expand the ban from 18,000 km2 to 48,000 km2 of the UK's offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), subject to a 12-week industry consultation. The UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, is addressing the issue amid warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life.

          <p>California's fuel imports surged to a four-year high in May as refiners turned to Asian trading partners and unusual routes to compensate for supply shortages, driven by refinery outages. Recent outages at refineries owned by Chevron, PBF Energy, and Valero caused a supply crunch, necessitating increased imports to meet demand. Imports from the Bahamas, a rarely used trade route for West Coast refiners, hit a record high, indicating the extent of the supply challenges; this trend underscores California's growing reliance on imports due to shrinking refining capacity and increasing regulatory and cost pressures.</p>
