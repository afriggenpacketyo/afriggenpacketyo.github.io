          <h2>Exploring the American Phenomenon of Doomsday Prepping</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox podcast explores the motivations and extent of doomsday prepping in America, tracing its roots to a sense of self-reliance and historical frontier mentality. The discussion covers the spectrum from high-end 'bug-out bags' marketed by Silicon Valley startups to widespread preparedness measures in response to extreme weather events. The podcast highlights how prepping is both a reflection of American individualism and a critique of inadequate government responses to disasters. The conversation also touches on the 'bunkerization fantasy' among the ultra-wealthy and the question of whether individual or collective action is more effective in facing potential catastrophes.</p>

          <p>British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, may be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a developing trade agreement with the Trump administration. This potential deal aims to provide certainty to the UK's ¬£40bn aerospace industry, supporting 450,000 jobs. The agreement would also benefit the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines and US-based maintenance facilities require a steady flow of parts. The deal follows relief offered to the car and steel industries, with car tariffs potentially decreasing and steel tariffs potentially going to zero.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant surge following President Donald Trump's announcement of a 'total reset' in trade relations with China. Bitcoin briefly neared $105,000, and Ethereum also saw gains, though both retreated shortly after. Trump stated that the two countries negotiated in a 'friendly, but constructive' manner, expressing hope for increased American business opportunities in China. The trade talks in Geneva mark the first high-level meeting since tariff hikes in April, with the U.S. currently levying a 145% tariff on Chinese imports and China imposing a 125% tariff on U.S. imports.</p>

          <p>Chinese mathematicians have resolved the Kervaire invariant problem, a 65-year-old mathematical puzzle, using major computational methods. This breakthrough provides proof that manifolds of Kervaire invariant one exist in dimension 126, ending a long-standing mystery in the mathematical community. The Kervaire invariant is a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through 'surgery.' This achievement was made by Wang Guozhen, Lin Weinan, and Xu Zhouli from Fudan University and UCLA.</p>

          <p>John Cameron Mitchell argues that today's young people need to learn how to be punk to confront the challenges of a post-democratic America. Drawing from his experiences in the military, theater, and queer activism, Mitchell advocates for D.I.Y. collective action and encourages students to stop canceling each other and create useful stories outside approved systems. He emphasizes the importance of community, empathy, and analog experiences to combat the isolation and control of corporate-driven culture. Mitchell also stresses the need for kindness and connection in a world where all news is suspect.</p>

          <p>Elissa Strauss argues that motherhood should be viewed as a Hero's Journey, challenging the traditional narrative that only leaving home and loved ones leads to self-discovery. She contends that caring for another can be an epic journey with its own trials and triumphs, offering profound insights about ourselves and life. By recognizing the challenges and complexities of intimate relationships, society can better appreciate and support those who invest in long-term connections, even when inconvenient. This perspective can also help shift away from simplistic binaries often applied to motherhood.</p>
