          <p>Shenzhen, China's warm southern tech hub, is becoming an unlikely skiing destination with the opening of what is touted as the world's largest indoor ski resort. The new Qianhai Huafa Snow World aims to capitalize on the growing winter sports economy and boost consumer spending, especially during national holidays. This development allows ski enthusiasts in southern China to enjoy the sport year-round without traveling to colder climates, reflecting a broader trend of expanding recreational infrastructure in the country. The massive resort features five slopes and is attracting visitors from nearby cities who are eager to hit the slopes despite the region's tropical temperatures.</p>

          <p>The UK government has agreed to underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for Jaguar Land Rover to support the automaker's supply chain amid a prolonged production shutdown. The shutdown was caused by a significant cyber-attack at the end of August, which has cost the company an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the solvency of smaller suppliers. This government intervention, a first of its kind in response to a cyber-attack, aims to protect thousands of jobs and provide financial stability to the hundreds of firms in JLR's supply chain. Production is not expected to resume until at least the beginning of October as the company works to recover from the hack. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum to decide on severely restricting the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums within the city. The proposal aims to reduce noise and air pollution by banning gas-powered devices entirely and limiting the use of electric models to a three-month period from October to December. Supporters of the measure argue that these devices are harmful to the environment and microorganisms, advocating for the use of traditional rakes instead. Opponents, however, view the potential ban as an unnecessary and burdensome prohibition that would complicate property maintenance for many citizens.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has pledged to begin the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth. Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce the plan, which is central to Labour's promise of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified several potential locations, with Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London being the most promising initial sites. The plan revives the post-war model of creating new towns, with development corporations potentially being granted special planning powers to accelerate construction and ensure affordability.</p>

          <p>Swiss voters are participating in a second national referendum on the introduction of an optional electronic identity card system. A similar proposal was rejected in 2021 due to public concerns over data protection and the involvement of private companies in managing the system. The revised plan ensures the e-ID will be managed entirely by the state, with user data stored on their smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the system will streamline many online bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain wary of potential privacy infringements and the risk of data being used for tracking or marketing purposes.</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season, an issue manager Eddie Howe has taken responsibility for. The club hired set-piece specialist Martin Mark from Danish club Midtjylland to improve their performance in this area, which has led to tactical shifts like an increased use of long throws. However, the team has scored only once from a corner or free-kick so far. As they prepare to face Arsenal, a team highly proficient from dead-ball situations, Newcastle's ability to capitalize on these crucial moments remains a key area for improvement.</p>

          <p>In response to recent controversial claims about autism from the Trump administration, an opinion piece highlights the positive traits often associated with autistic people that stand in stark contrast to the former president's character. The author argues that many autistic individuals demonstrate a capacity for deep focus, a strong adherence to facts, profound empathy, and an exceptional memory. The article criticizes the framing of autism as a tragedy in need of a cure, instead celebrating the unique perspectives and intense joy that autistic people bring to the world. It suggests that society, and leaders like Trump, could learn much from these qualities.</p>

          <p>As the Los Angeles Dodgers head into the MLB postseason, key questions remain about the health of star players and the final composition of their wild-card series roster. Infielder Max Muncy has been sidelined with leg issues, while the availability of catcher Will Smith, recovering from a hand fracture, remains uncertain. The team also faces difficult decisions regarding its pitching staff, particularly the bullpen, with several rookie and veteran arms competing for a limited number of spots. Manager Dave Roberts has indicated that the final roster choices will be strategic, potentially tailored to matchups against their first-round opponent.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is confronting its violent, anti-immigrant past by dedicating a new monument to commemorate the 1885 massacre of Chinese coal miners. A seven-foot-tall bronze statue now stands to honor the 28 Chinese laborers who were killed by a mob of European miners amid labor tensions. This public acknowledgment comes as archaeologists excavate the site of the former Chinatown, uncovering artifacts from the community that was burned down. The town's effort to memorialize this dark chapter of its history occurs at a time of heightened national debate over immigration, creating a complex local dialogue about its past and present.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has expressed confidence that his government can "pull this round" as the Labour Party's annual conference begins amid challenging opinion polls. Facing a polling deficit to Reform UK and speculation about a potential leadership challenge, Starmer is using the conference to position Labour as a stable alternative to what he calls Reform's "toxic divide and decline." He has intensified his attacks on Reform leader Nigel Farage, labeling him "grubby" and "unpatriotic" for criticizing the country abroad. The conference is a critical opportunity for Labour to reset its narrative and regain public support.</p>

          <p>Florence Welch, the lead singer of Florence and the Machine, has revealed that she underwent life-saving emergency surgery for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy in August 2023. She described the experience as the "closest I came to death," explaining that she was unknowingly bleeding internally while performing on stage. After a scan revealed a significant amount of blood in her abdomen, she required immediate surgery to have her fallopian tube removed. At the time, Welch had canceled several concerts for health reasons she was not yet ready to disclose, and is now sharing her story ahead of a new album release.</p>

          <p>China's Sanxingdui Museum, home to remarkable Bronze Age artifacts, is planning to use modern technology to showcase its ancient treasures in overseas exhibitions. Since many of the museum's most iconic pieces are classified as national treasures and are forbidden from leaving the country, officials are exploring immersive digital exhibitions and high-quality replicas. This approach would allow international audiences to experience the unique artifacts from the ancient Shu civilization without the physical items having to travel. The museum, located in Sichuan province, hopes to launch its first international exhibition using these methods next year, pending state approval.</p>
