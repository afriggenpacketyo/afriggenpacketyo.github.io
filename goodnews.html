          <h2>Treasury Secretary Bessent Signals Likely Extension of China Tariff Deadline Amid Planned Talks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 09:28:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that an extension of the August 12 tariff deadline with China is probable. The upcoming talks in Stockholm are expected to formalize this extension, continuing the 90-day suspension of heavy tariffs that began in May. Bessent expressed a constructive outlook on U.S.-China trade relations, hoping to broaden discussions to include China's manufacturing output and its role concerning sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. This development suggests a move towards de-escalation and more comprehensive negotiations between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's endorsement and Coca-Cola's confirmation of a new cane sugar version, health experts are weighing in on the nutritional debate. While cane sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup have slightly different chemical compositions, experts state their overall health impacts are similar when consumed in excess. Both are considered empty calories and contribute to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Some experts express concern over the higher fructose content in corn syrup and its potential link to inflammation, but the consensus remains that moderation of all added sugars is key.</p>

          <h2>Treasury Secretary Bessent Clarifies Stance, Stating Fed Chair Powell Need Not Resign</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he advocates for a comprehensive internal review of the Federal Reserve's operations, he does not believe Chair Jerome Powell should resign. This position contrasts with President Trump's repeated calls for Powell to step down. Bessent suggested the review should focus on the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, which he claims have grown without sufficient oversight. He framed this as an opportunity for Powell to "right-size" the institution's role, separating its core monetary duties from other expanding responsibilities and preserving their integrity from political influence.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has refuted media reports claiming that Berkshire Hathaway's railroad, BNSF, was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a rival. Speaking to CNBC, the veteran investor stated that no one from the investment bank had contacted him or his successor, Greg Abel, about any such deal. Buffett reiterated his long-held skepticism of using external bankers for deals, emphasizing his preference for direct negotiations. The denial follows reports from Semafor and Reuters that suggested Berkshire was exploring a major acquisition in the railroad sector.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, appointing former Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly to the role of shadow housing secretary. This move positions him to challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner directly in Parliament. The shake-up also includes Kevin Hollinrake becoming the new party chairman and Stuart Andrew moving to the health brief. The changes come eight months into Badenoch's leadership as the party seeks to renew its policy platform and improve its standing in the polls after a period of poor electoral results.</p>

A hypothetical $1,000 investment made 10 years ago, with dividends reinvested, would be worth approximately $2,323 today. While its performance has sometimes lagged the broader S&P 500 index, the company is favored by investors for its stability, consistent dividend payments, and reliable consumer demand for its products.

          <p>Public bus companies across China are facing severe financial pressure due to declining ridership and mounting losses.

This move comes as national bus passenger volume has fallen to just over half of its 2019 levels, driven by the rise of subways and ride-hailing services, forcing operators to seek unconventional solutions to survive.</p>
