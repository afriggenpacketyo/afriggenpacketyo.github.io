          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expressed optimism about fixing the FAA amid recent outages and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. He cited bipartisan commitment to overhauling the air traffic control system and stressed the importance of upfront funding for comprehensive project planning. Kirby emphasized that safety remains the aviation industry's top priority and outlined backup procedures in place during outages. He acknowledged that disruptions are deliberately implemented to prioritize safety, with United proactively reducing flights to create more space at the airport.</p>

          <p>Washington officials expressed optimism following trade negotiations with China in Geneva, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent promising a briefing on the outcome. The talks aim to de-escalate tensions amid a global trade onslaught initiated by President Trump, who imposed tariffs on China. The discussions occur as numerous countries file complaints against Trump's approach at the World Trade Organization, arguing that his tariffs violate WTO rules. Earlier in the week, Washington and London announced a trade deal, praised as a "breakthrough" by Trump and a commitment to get one done.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar to be used as Air Force One, raising legal and ethical questions. The administration intends to retrofit the plane for official presidential use and transfer it to Trump's presidential library foundation after his term. This move comes amid frustration over delays and cost overruns in modernizing existing Air Force One aircraft. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says that the US and China have made "substantial progress" on de-escalating the trade war as high-level talks wrapped in Geneva, Switzerland.

          <p>The White House announced that the United States and China have reached a trade deal following negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer indicated the agreement addresses national security concerns related to trade imbalances. While details are scarce, officials from both sides have expressed optimism about de-escalating the trade war and normalizing relations, though Trump's rhetoric about opening China to US business has raised eyebrows. Trump has emphasized the need for China to open up to American business, seemingly ignoring the existing trade relations between the two nations.</p>

The US has insisted that Iran must scrap its uranium enrichment to prevent the country developing nuclear weapons, but Tehran denies it has such an aim and on Sunday again stressed it did not intend to give up the programme.</p>

According to ABC‚Äôs sources, Trump‚Äôs attorney general Pam Bondi and his top White House lawyer David Warrington have pre-emptively concluded that it is ‚Äúlegally permissible‚Äù for Trump to accept the luxury gift and then transfer it over to his presidential library.</p>
