          <p>Shohei Ohtani continued his impressive season with his 10th home run, tying the game in the sixth inning, but the Los Angeles Dodgers ultimately lost to the Miami Marlins 5-4 in 10 innings. Ohtani also contributed a double, going 2-for-5 with two RBIs in the game. The Dodgers faced an uphill battle after placing Teoscar Hernandez on the injured list, impacting their offensive lineup, and Ohtani acknowledged the team's need to score more early runs to secure victories. Despite the loss, Ohtani's consistent power hitting marks his fifth straight season with double-digit home runs.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating geopolitical tensions with Pakistan, Indian markets have remained largely stable, driven by strong domestic demand and optimism regarding India's growth prospects. Investors appear to be drawing confidence from India's progress in trade talks with major partners, including a recently sealed free trade agreement with the U.K., and the expectation of a bilateral trade deal with the U.S. soon. While experts acknowledge the potential for short-term market volatility if the conflict escalates, the overall sentiment suggests that the Indian economy's strong fundamentals will continue to outweigh geopolitical concerns. The article notes that Indian assets are expected to remain fairly contained despite the increase in tensions.</p>
