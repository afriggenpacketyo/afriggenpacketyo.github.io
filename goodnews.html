          <p>Amid a shifting economic landscape where inflation has cooled, this article explores the potential returns of investing in a three-year certificate of deposit (CD). With current rates for such CDs ranging between 4.00% and 4.15%, a $10,000 deposit could yield between $1,248 and $1,297 in interest over 36 months. The article highlights the benefit of locking in these fixed rates, providing a predictable and guaranteed return in an uncertain interest rate environment. It contrasts this stability with the variable rates of money market accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For prospective homebuyers and those considering refinancing, this article provides an overview of current mortgage interest rates as of late June 2025. Average rates for a 30-year mortgage are around 6.87%, while a 15-year mortgage is near 6.06%, with similar figures for refinancing. The article suggests that while rates are higher than in previous years, there are strategies to secure a better deal, such as improving one's credit score and shopping around with different lenders.

Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset, with its price impacted by supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation, and geopolitical uncertainty. The text explains that during times of economic instability or a weakening U.S. dollar, investors often turn to gold, driving its price up.

The article notes that while the trust is taking profits after a period of strong performance, the move is based on a discipline of not letting a position become too large, rather than a loss of faith in the company. The summary acknowledges CEO Bob Iger's successful turnaround efforts, which have improved profitability and restored Wall Street's confidence in the entertainment giant.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of researchers in China has discovered a "genetic switch" that could enable mammals to regenerate damaged tissue, a capability typically limited to animals like salamanders. Their study, published in the journal *Science*, found that mammals' inability to regenerate stems from a failure to produce enough retinoic acid, a key compound derived from vitamin A. By reactivating the specific DNA pathway responsible for this acid's production, the scientists were able to successfully trigger ear tissue regeneration in mice. This breakthrough could have significant implications for advancing regenerative medicine in humans.</p>

The piece contrasts Mamdani's charismatic, disciplined, and morally-driven campaign with the "passivity and risk aversion" of current Democratic leaders.

          <p>The hotel minibar, once a symbol of travel convenience and indulgence, has largely fallen out of favor in the United States. Introduced globally in the 1970s, minibars became a logistical and financial burden for hotels due to high operational costs, food spoilage, and theft. By the early 2000s, major chains began removing them. In their place, hotels are shifting to more modern and profitable alternatives like 24/7 lobby marketplaces and strategic partnerships with food delivery apps such as DoorDash and Grubhub, which offer guests greater choice and convenience.</p>
