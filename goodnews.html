          <p>Suga, the final member of the K-Pop group BTS to complete South Korea's mandatory military service, has been discharged, paving the way for the band's potential reunion. Big Hit Music confirmed that Suga completed his alternative service on June 18 and his official discharge date was June 21. Suga expressed gratitude to fans for their patience and apologized for causing disappointment and concern last year, referencing a past drunk driving incident. The anticipation is high for BTS's comeback, as the group has been on a self-described "hiatus" since 2022 while members fulfilled their military duties, and they are expected to hold their largest-ever world tour in 2026.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively identifies and prevents health issues before symptoms appear. The screening will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using umbilical cord blood samples, looking for gene disorders that develop in early childhood and have effective treatments.</p>

The company previously closed its stores in France in 2022 to adjust its retail strategy to better align with consumer purchasing behavior.

          <p>The UK Parliament has voted in favor of a bill that would allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social shift. The bill now moves to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face considerable debate and potential amendments. The government anticipates a longer "commencement period" to prepare for the implementation of the law. While opinion polls show significant public support for the change, some opponents raised concerns about the practicalities of the bill, suggesting it be called "assisted suicide" or "assisted killing".</p>

          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme allows people to stay for up to four weeks free of charge in cities like Guben, located on the border with Poland. The goal is to encourage people to settle in these areas, which have experienced significant demographic changes since German reunification, including declining birth rates and emigration of young people. The initiative aims to showcase the benefits of living in these cities, such as affordable housing, less traffic, and a close-knit community.</p>

Head coach Andy Farrell expressed his disappointment, emphasizing the need for sharper performance as they continue their tour in Australia.

          <p>Foreign tourist visits to locations related to manga and anime works in Japan have proven beneficial to local economies, according to a research institute. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists visited places linked to movies or anime, up from 1.15 million in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods are estimated to have totaled 54.3 billion yen last year, a significant increase from 2016. The trend, known as "seichi junrei," involves fans visiting locations that inspired or were settings for popular works, boosting local economies and offsetting the country's digital trade deficit.</p>

          <p>As rice prices surge to record highs, Japanese restaurants and food companies are turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., operator of Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to open more to diversify its operations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle business due to saturation in the beef bowl market. Consumers are also seeking alternatives, with sales of frozen udon noodles and packaged udon noodle soup ingredients increasing. (not investment advice)</p>
