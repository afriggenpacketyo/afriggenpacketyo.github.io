          <p>A recent New York Times article explores the debate surrounding the arrival of Artificial General Intelligence (A.G.I.), a technology that matches human-level intelligence. Tech executives like Sam Altman, Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk predict its imminent arrival, driving significant advancements in A.I. technologies, while other experts, including Nick Frosst and Steven Pinker, remain skeptical, citing the limitations of current systems in replicating human intellect and adaptability. The article highlights that A.G.I. claims are based on statistical extrapolations and wishful thinking, as machines still struggle with tasks like recognizing irony or feeling empathy. It emphasizes that achieving A.G.I. requires a new, currently unimagined idea, making its timeline uncertain.</p>

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two of the largest cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge in a deal valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. The merger aims to enhance their competitiveness against rivals like Comcast and Verizon, as the broadband industry faces increasing competition from wireless providers. Both companies have been grappling with customer losses in traditional cable TV, leading them to focus on their mobile businesses. Charter, the second-largest publicly traded cable company, was up roughly 8% in premarket trading from its previous close. This deal marks one of the largest in corporate America this year, reflecting efforts to consolidate amidst economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent Middle East trip resulted in multibillion-dollar technology investments, particularly in artificial intelligence. Nvidia and AMD are now permitted to sell advanced chips to Saudi, Emirati, and Qatari customers, including a massive new A.I. campus in Abu Dhabi. This move has raised concerns among security officials who fear the technology could end up in China, as the Biden administration previously restricted such exports. Despite these concerns, investors are optimistic, with shares in Nvidia and AMD soaring after the deals were announced. The article underscores a rift within the Trump administration regarding A.I. and its potential security implications.</p>
