          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned an ad for Trip drinks, ruling it made unauthorized health claims about its ability to induce calm and reduce stress. The watchdog found that language like "crafted for calm" was prohibited and that claims about magnesium's effect on cortisol were unsubstantiated. The company was also cited for an inaccurate "0g added sugar" claim and has been ordered not to run the ad again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Crypto markets experienced a rebound as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key U.S. crypto legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. Despite a temporary dip after the House failed to advance the bills, analysts view their passage as a matter of "when," not "if." President Trump also indicated that some Republican opponents have shifted their stance, boosting confidence in the sector's regulatory future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The producer price index (PPI), a key measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This flat reading, which followed an upwardly revised gain in May, suggests that President Trump's tariffs are having only a marginal impact on prices so far. On a year-over-year basis, the PPI rose 2.3%, its lowest level since September 2024, providing a conflicting signal on future inflation trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Barclays Bank £42 million for significant failures in its anti-money laundering controls. The regulator found that Barclays did not properly vet two clients, Stunt & Co and WealthTek, facilitating the movement of funds linked to a multimillion-pound money laundering operation. The FCA noted that Barclays' cooperation in the investigation led to a significant reduction in the potential fine, and the bank has since strengthened its financial crime controls.</p>
