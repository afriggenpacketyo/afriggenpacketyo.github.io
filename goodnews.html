          <p>The UK government has signed an agreement with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to explore using artificial intelligence in public services. The deal aims to boost productivity in sectors like education, defense, and the justice system, with Technology Secretary Peter Kyle stating AI will be fundamental to driving economic growth. The memorandum of understanding includes provisions for developing safeguards and an information-sharing program to manage security risks. While the government is eager to adopt AI, the move has drawn criticism from groups concerned about issues like copyright and data privacy.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to land in Minot, North Dakota. In a calm announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that the military plane was on a converging course and was not announced by air traffic control, which operates visually at the airport. He apologized for the sudden turn, which he deemed the safest course of action. The Air Force confirmed its B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover, and the FAA is now investigating the incident.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Push Nations to Dismantle Internal Trade Barriers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:00:13 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a "silver lining." The author suggests the tariffs are exposing the hypocrisy of other countries and trading blocs, such as Canada, China, and the EU, which maintain their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. The pressure from U.S. tariffs is reportedly prompting some of these nations to address and remove long-standing domestic obstacles to commerce and trade. This could potentially unlock economic growth that was previously stifled by their own protectionist policies, creating an unintended positive outcome. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials explained that most of those initially reported missing were tourists who had returned home safely without checking in. The flash floods killed at least 135 people in Texas, with most deaths occurring in Kerr County, where the river rose 26 feet and washed away buildings and vehicles.</p>

In a podcast interview, the 76-year-old singer-songwriter mentioned he is still working on his balance but that the condition sounds worse than he feels. NPH, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, forced Joel to cancel a series of concerts in May. He is currently undergoing physical therapy and has expressed a commitment to prioritizing his health and recovery.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—that he believes are set to continue their momentum, driven by excitement from retail investors. He dubbed the group "PARC," noting they represent a separate track in the market from the S&P 500, where a handful of names are relentlessly pushed up by passionate buyers. Cramer suggests that while these stocks are trendy, they also have seemingly solid earnings and analyst attention. He advises that investors can make money on these names but should exercise discipline by taking profits after significant gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with flights featuring assigned seats set to begin on January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights starting this July. The change marks a significant shift for the discount carrier, which has allowed passengers to choose their own seats upon boarding for decades. The new policy will allow for different fare bundles, including options for extra legroom, and will be accompanied by an overhaul of the airline's boarding process to a numbered group system.</p>
