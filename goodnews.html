          <p>Chicago experienced a rare dust storm, causing the skyline to disappear as winds of 60 to 70 mph swept through dry farmlands. The National Weather Service issued only its second dust storm warning for the Chicago office, leading to visibility dropping to zero in some areas. The dust storm forced drivers on Interstate 55 to pull over, and a ground stop was briefly implemented at Midway International Airport. Skies cleared within 30 to 45 minutes after the storm passed, leaving residents to reflect on the unusual event.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to release audio recordings of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s 2023 interview with special counsel Robert K. Hur. The audio clip shows Mr. Biden stumbling over the years his son died and Donald J. Trump was first elected, and when he left office as vice president. Republicans have long sought to make public a recording of the 2023 interview, arguing that it might offer evidence of a decline in Joseph R. Biden Jr.‚Äôs mental acuity.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving discarded shoes a second life through reuse and recycling. The company collects used sneakers from donation boxes across the United States and sorts them for either resale or recycling.

Sneaker Impact aims to reduce waste and promote environmentally friendly business practices, hoping to inspire other companies to replicate their model.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement to shut down seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after experiencing a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. The plants under consideration are Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., which together account for approximately 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity.

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner argued that voters favored less state intervention and more freedom, while the current government is delivering more state control and debt. Christian D√ºrr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman. Lindner's departure followed his firing as finance minister, which led the FDP to withdraw from former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition, triggering an early election.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1, featuring lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and maneuverability. The Tianxing-1 operates similarly to hypersonic glide missiles but travels at a slower pace. This guided munition is designed to be launched from ground-based platforms and transition into a glide phase to engage targets.</p>
