          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily surpassed Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual after shares in his software company surged over 40%. The significant stock increase was fueled by a highly optimistic forecast for Oracle's cloud infrastructure business and a boom in artificial intelligence-related deals. Ellison's net worth reached a peak of $393 billion before a slight dip in Oracle's share price returned Musk to the top spot later in the day. The event highlights the intense market competition between tech giants, as Oracle's cloud business grows while Musk's Tesla faces challenges from shifting electric vehicle policies.

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has finally offered her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie, starring Meryl Streep as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly, a "fair shot" that possessed humor and wit. She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, initially unaware of the film's subject matter, and praised Streep's performance as fantastic. The review comes as a sequel is in production, with a planned 2026 release, which will see the return of original cast members including Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Emily Blunt.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to announce an interest rate cut, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, financial experts suggest that renewing a CD can still be a prudent strategy. Current CD rates remain competitive, often around 4.50%, which is significantly higher than rates for traditional savings accounts. Furthermore, many banks may have already priced in the anticipated rate cut, meaning today's rates might be the best available for some time. Locking in a high rate now can protect savings from the declining returns expected on variable-rate accounts if further cuts occur later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Food delivery giant DoorDash is expanding its autonomous delivery ambitions by leasing a warehouse in San Francisco's Mission District to serve as a research and development facility. The company plans to test and advance its drone delivery technology at the 34,325-square-foot site, employing around 200 people. While most test flights will occur indoors, some outdoor tests are planned within a gated area, with drones flying up to 150 feet. This move follows successful drone delivery pilots in other states and Australia, as DoorDash and competitors like Amazon and Walmart explore automated solutions to expedite last-mile deliveries and reshape the logistics landscape.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged nearly 36% in a single day, its best performance since 1992, adding $244 billion to its market value. The massive rally was triggered by the company's announcement of an unprecedented $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This growth is primarily driven by soaring demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is essential for running the large workloads required by artificial intelligence applications. The exceptional forecast for future cloud revenue completely overshadowed a first-quarter report that missed top and bottom-line estimates, signaling strong investor confidence in Oracle's position in the AI market.

          <p>Former footballer and presenter Gary Lineker has won the Best TV Presenter award at the National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly. The victory comes shortly after Lineker's departure from the BBC's "Match of the Day" following 26 years as host. In his acceptance speech, Lineker, whose social media use has been a source of controversy, thanked his colleagues and stated the award shows it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for others. The viewer-voted awards also saw the popular reality show "The Traitors" lose out to "I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!"</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a 54-minute private tea at Clarence House, marking their first reunion in 19 months. The meeting occurred during the Duke of Sussex's four-day visit to the UK for charity commitments, while the King was in London for his ongoing cancer treatment. This brief reunion is viewed as a potentially positive step in their strained relationship, though Harry did not meet with his estranged brother, Prince William, during the trip. Following the meeting, Harry attended an Invictus Games event and told a well-wisher that the King was doing "great," signaling a moment of personal connection amid public tensions.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains potential biosignatures, representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was taken from an ancient river valley in Jezero Crater and exhibits mineral patterns and textures often associated with biological processes on Earth. While researchers cannot yet rule out nonbiological origins, the finding is a major step in the quest to answer if life ever existed on Mars. The agency is now focused on the complex and costly Mars Sample Return mission to bring the rock to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

The successful IPO, which valued the company at approximately $17.3 billion, signals strong investor appetite for new tech listings.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition demanding that FIFA abandon its dynamic pricing model for the 2026 World Cup. Mamdani argues that the practice, which allows ticket prices to fluctuate with demand, prioritizes profit over accessibility for genuine fans and will inflate costs far beyond initial estimates. The petition also calls for setting aside 15% of tickets for local residents and capping resale prices, policies that FIFA will implement in Mexico due to local laws but not in the U.S. or Canada. Mamdani frames the issue as an affront to the game's spirit, making affordability a central theme of his campaign.</p>

          <p>A widespread bus strike planned for the upcoming weekend in London has been largely called off after most workers accepted a revised pay offer. Employees of London United, one of the two bus companies involved, voted to accept the deal, canceling their planned walkout which would have affected about 60 routes in north-west and south-west London. The dispute centered on pay and working conditions with parent company First Bus, which described its offer as above inflation. However, some limited industrial action may still proceed if negotiations between the Unite union and the second operator, London Transit, do not reach a successful conclusion.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, the mortgage market is becoming more favorable for buyers, with average 30-year rates recently falling to an 11-month low of 6.50%. For homebuyers seeking even lower rates, several strategies can help secure a mortgage under 6%. These include considering an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which currently offers lower introductory rates, and diligently shopping around among different lenders, which can often yield a rate up to a full percentage point below the average. Additionally, strategically timing a loan application around Fed announcements could provide brief windows of opportunity for lower rates, though this requires agility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the profound and growing economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral commerce increasing nearly fivefold over the past two decades. While export-related jobs offered higher wages, the impact of imports was found to be more widespread across Brazilian industries and communities. However, the study also warns of the risks associated with this dependency, noting that 80% of Brazil's exports to China are concentrated in just three commodities: soybeans, iron ore, and oil.</p>
