          <p>Apple has reported third-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's predictions for both profit and revenue, marking its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021. Overall revenue increased by 10%, driven by a 13% year-over-year rise in iPhone sales, particularly for the popular iPhone 16 model. The company's Mac and Services divisions also saw substantial growth, though iPad and wearables sales experienced a decline. Apple's performance was also strong in China, where sales rose by 4% after previous quarters of decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has revealed plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom to be constructed in the East Wing, a project President Trump has long desired. The construction, estimated to cost $200 million, will be funded by President Trump and other anonymous private donors, with work scheduled to begin in September. The new facility will have a seating capacity of 650, eliminating the need for temporary tents for large state dinners and other formal events. Officials stated the project will be completed well before the end of the current presidential term.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases include a new installment of "The Naked Gun," which successfully revives the classic franchise's absurd humor with Liam Neeson in the lead role. The horror film "Together," starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, explores a deteriorating relationship that takes a supernatural turn, featuring effective body horror elements. Additionally, the under-the-radar thriller "She Rides Shotgun" is praised for its solid execution and the strong performances of Taron Egerton and child actor Ana Sophia Heger, who portray a father-daughter duo on the run.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, with 250 remaining to protect federal property. These troops were part of a larger contingent sent by the Trump administration two months ago to manage protests related to federal immigration policies. The deployment was met with opposition from California state and local officials, who filed a lawsuit arguing the response should be handled by local law enforcement. California politicians, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom, praised the withdrawal and called for the removal of all remaining troops.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has overturned a law that would have limited the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after days of large-scale protests across Ukraine, led primarily by young people who feared the law would jeopardize the nation's path toward European Union integration. The original bill would have given the presidentially-appointed general prosecutor control over high-level corruption cases. The swift U-turn by the government highlights the influence of public pressure and the critical importance of anti-corruption reforms for maintaining Western financial support during the war.</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for California governor, former Vice President Kamala Harris has numerous potential paths for her future. Experts suggest that, given her age and desire to reshape her public narrative after the 2024 election loss, she will likely remain in the public eye. Options range from another presidential run in 2028 to focusing on a specific cause like artificial intelligence, similar to Al Gore's work on climate change. She could also follow the Obamas' model by starting a production company, writing books, and launching a podcast to maintain her political relevance and influence within the Democratic Party.</p>

The league aims to offer players equity stakes, a practice currently prohibited for active NBA athletes. This new league would require full-time commitments, positioning it as a potential rival to the NBA's own European expansion plans.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has traced the origin of the potato to an unexpected ancestor: the tomato. Researchers say the modern potato evolved around nine million years ago through a hybridization event between a wild, non-tuber-producing potato species and an ancient tomato. This interbreeding provided a crucial gene from the tomato that enabled the potato to form its starchy tubers. By analyzing hundreds of genomes of cultivated and wild potatoes, scientists have solved the long-standing puzzle of how the popular vegetable acquired its most defining characteristic.</p>
