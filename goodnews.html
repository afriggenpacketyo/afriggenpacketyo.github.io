        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, also known as the "sea moth", in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, part of the extinct group radiodonts, possessed a unique pencil sharpener-like mouth and intimidating claws, challenging previous understandings of radiodont complexity. The discovery revealed a multi-segmented abdomen-like region with gills, similar to modern arthropods, and provided insights into the open circulatory system of this ancient predator. The sea moth's existence sheds light on the diversity of life during the Cambrian period and the rapid evolution of animal groups.</p>

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing train drivers resumed negotiations on Saturday, earlier than initially planned, as the transit strike entered its second day. The strike, the first in 40 years, has disrupted the agency's operations, stranding thousands of commuters, with the main point of contention being pay parity with other regional commuter railroads. Despite contingency plans involving supplemental buses, the agency urged residents to work from home if possible, preparing for the potential continuation of the strike.</p>

          <p>Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota criticized Donald Trump, accusing him of abusing power and undermining the rule of law. Walz urged law school graduates to stand up against abuses of power, asserting that lawyers are the "first and last line of defense."

          <p>Federal courts have consistently upheld the principle of due process for immigrants facing deportation, pushing back against the Trump administration's efforts to expedite removals. The Supreme Court recently criticized the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants in Texas, emphasizing the need for immigrants to challenge their deportations. The courts' stance underscores the importance of protecting fundamental rights, even as the administration seeks to expand its deportation powers.</p>

The move comes as the Trump administration aims to bring peace and stability to the Middle East, but the abrupt announcement has raised questions about the decision-making process.</p>
