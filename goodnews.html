        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer 2025 begins, homeowners may consider using home equity loans for expenses like vacations, tuition, or home improvements, but it's crucial to proceed cautiously. A home equity loan provides a lump sum with a fixed interest rate, while a HELOC offers a revolving line of credit with variable rates. Experts advise comparing rates and terms from multiple lenders and using the funds for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-interest debt, rather than discretionary spending. Prudent use of home equity can improve overall financial health (not investment advice).</p>
