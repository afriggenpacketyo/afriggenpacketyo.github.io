          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen defended the controversial "tush push" play, despite his team voting to ban it.  The NFL needed 24 teams to vote for the ban, but only 22 did.

The Green Bay Packers proposed the rule change, citing safety concerns, although the NFL Competition Committee noted a lack of data on injuries caused by the play.
