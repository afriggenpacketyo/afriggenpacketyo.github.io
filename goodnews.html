Kyei oversees the financial governance of the Bank's £1 trillion balance sheet and leads critical funding reforms, establishing her as one of the UK's most senior finance leaders. The mother-of-four, who holds a chemistry degree from Oxford and previously worked in investment banking, expressed deep humility at the recognition.

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a rise on Friday following the White House announcement that U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping are set to hold talks next week. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Trump's upcoming diplomatic tour to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, with the crucial meeting with Xi scheduled for next Thursday after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit. This news spurred positive market reactions across the region, with Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbing 0.78% and the Topix adding 0.39%. Concurrently, Japan's core inflation rate accelerated to 2.9% in September, further influencing market dynamics.</p>

          <p>U.S. student lunch debt has escalated to nearly $200 million annually, prompting grassroots efforts to bridge the gap. In Utah, single father DJ Bracken established the Utah Lunch Debt Relief Foundation, paying off debt for over 30 schools after being shocked by the figures. Similarly, special education teacher Kati Jo Christensen used her popular TikTok videos to raise nearly $30,000 for lunch debt relief. While these acts of kindness are impactful, Bracken stresses the need for lawmakers to implement systemic change, advocating for expanded free lunch access, which only nine states currently offer permanently since pandemic-era programs ended in 2022.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, a decision that followed widespread condemnation from California leaders and public protests. Initial reports of over 100 federal agents being sent to the Bay Area had triggered large demonstrations outside a Coast Guard base. Trump confirmed the cancellation after discussions with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley leaders. California Governor Gavin Newsom's office praised the reversal, stating Trump "finally, for once, listened to reason." Despite the pullback, local officials and community groups remain vigilant, planning further demonstrations and strengthening rapid response networks and legal aid for residents who might still be affected by federal immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>BeOne Medicines, a global drug company originating from mainland China, plans to significantly expand its cancer drug offerings in Hong Kong and boost production in Guangzhou. This strategic move capitalizes on Hong Kong's easier drug approval regime, implemented two years ago. The company has already introduced three cancer medications to Hong Kong and intends to seek approval for additional medical indications by year-end. BeOne's Guangzhou facility, which produces large molecule therapies like PD-1 inhibitors for various cancers, is slated to expand its capacity to supply Hong Kong, complementing its small-molecule production in Suzhou and a U.S. manufacturing site.</p>

The article highlights Alan Carr's growing enthusiasm as a Traitor and the return of the life-size chessboard challenge, which saw Nick Mohammed sabotage his own team to protect Faithfuls. The episode culminated in the banishment of Sir Stephen Fry, a Faithful, intensifying the game as the remaining contestants face a "face-to-face killing" next.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has characterized Max Verstappen as "cut-throat" in the Formula 1 title race, warning McLaren contenders Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about his relentless competitive nature. Verstappen, despite being 40 points behind, has shown strong recent form with three wins and a second place in four races. Hamilton, drawing on his own intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, stressed that being the hunter is easier than the defender, urging Piastri and Norris to be equally ruthless and consistent. The McLaren drivers, now free to race each other without internal team rules, acknowledge Verstappen's strong momentum but remain focused on their own performance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has reportedly informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to criminally charge Senator Adam Schiff of California with mortgage fraud. This assessment comes despite President Donald Trump's public calls for the prosecution of Schiff, a prominent critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. MSNBC, citing sources familiar with the matter, reported that U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes conveyed her view to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, though a controversial senior DOJ official is reportedly pushing to keep the investigation active. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, called the allegations politically motivated and baseless.</p>

This ethos stems from their sustained success and a collective focus on winning the World Series, aiming for their third title in six seasons to cement a modern-day dynasty. Veteran players and manager Dave Roberts emphasize a "one day at a time" mindset, avoiding fixation on historical stakes. This approach has enabled them to navigate an underwhelming regular season and achieve a dominant postseason run, embodying a culture where sustained winning is expected and ingrained in the team's DNA.</p>

Veterans groups condemned the move, arguing it used the shutdown as a pretext to deny veterans their rightful day in court, with some having waited decades for claims related to toxic exposure.
