          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of 10 inmates who escaped a New Orleans jail five months ago, has been captured in Atlanta following a Crime Stoppers tip. Convicted of a 2018 double murder, Groves was found hiding in a reinforced crawl space after a coordinated operation by U.S. Marshals and Atlanta Police, who deployed gas into the home. Investigators believe Groves was a ringleader in the May 16 jailbreak, which exposed significant security flaws in the 10-year-old Orleans Parish Justice Center. This article highlights the successful conclusion of the extensive manhunt and the efforts of multiple agencies, bringing all 10 escapees back into custody without injury.</p>

This new law allows community colleges and public schools to close and state employees to elect to take the day off for the five-day celebration, which marks the beginning of the Hindu new year. California joins Pennsylvania and Connecticut in officially recognizing Diwali, a holiday rooted in recognizing relationships and the triumph of light over darkness.

          <p>During a White House roundtable, Secretary of State Marco Rubio urgently delivered a handwritten note to President Trump, informing him that a Gaza peace deal was "very close" and advising him to announce it on Truth Social first. Trump subsequently shared the news, highlighting the rapid developments in the indirect negotiations brokered by his Middle East envoy and international mediators. The event showcased the dramatic, almost anxious, behind-the-scenes moments preceding the significant announcement, with Trump initially continuing his event despite Rubio's visible urgency. This article details the immediate lead-up to the president's declaration of a major diplomatic breakthrough, emphasizing the White House's eagerness to control the narrative.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a peace plan, as announced by President Trump, aiming to end the devastating Gaza conflict. This initial phase is expected to involve the release of all hostages held by Hamas and a withdrawal of Israeli troops to an agreed line, paving the way for a more durable peace. Mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, this agreement represents a significant breakthrough after previous failed truces, which saw immense casualties and infrastructure destruction. The plan also outlines Hamas disarming and stepping aside from Gaza's governance, with an international board supervising reconstruction and a vague pathway to Palestinian self-determination.</p>
