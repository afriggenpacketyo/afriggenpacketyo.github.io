          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner declared "faith is back in our government" at the agency's first-ever faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall. The gathering, featuring worship leader Sean Feucht, marked a significant shift in how the federal government engages with Christian organizations for recovery efforts. Turner emphasized that faith-based groups are crucial first responders in disasters, providing vital support in rebuilding homes and communities. This event symbolized a transformation for Feucht's "Let Us Worship" movement, gaining federal recognition and a platform after years of clashing with left-leaning local governments over worship restrictions.</p>

The Belarusian demonstrated remarkable composure, especially after failing to serve out the match at 5-4, to claim her fourth major singles title.

          <p>Schools across the United States are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, with approximately 2.5 million students now required to use them. This article explains how students secure their phones in these pouches upon arrival, which can only be unlocked at designated stations, aiming to reduce distractions. Educators, like Yonkers Middle High School principal Dr. Sandy Hattar, report positive changes, including increased student engagement and in-person interaction. While some students devise ways to bypass the system, the primary objective is to foster a cultural shift towards a less digitally dependent learning environment, despite ongoing debates about the cost and implementation challenges.</p>

This article suggests that Beijing is strategically enhancing its geopolitical profile, especially amidst perceived challenges to US credibility and reliability under the current US administration.

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats and an unforgettable experience after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game, an incident that went viral. Footage showed the ball initially given to the boy by his father, only for a woman to confront them and demand the ball, claiming it was hers. Both the Phillies and Marlins teams intervened to rectify the situation. The young fan was subsequently gifted a Miami Marlins swag bag and later met Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who presented him with an autographed baseball bat, turning a disappointing moment into a cherished memory.</p>

          <p>The EU is set to gradually introduce its much-delayed new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will significantly impact non-EU citizens traveling to the Schengen Area.
