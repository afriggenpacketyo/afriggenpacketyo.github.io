          <p>Meteorologists are monitoring Tropical Storm Humberto and a nearby developing system, likely to be named Imelda, for a potential interaction known as the Fujiwhara effect. This rare phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, which can alter their paths and intensity. While experts consider a full merger unlikely due to the size difference between the storms, the possibility of them "dancing" around each other exists. Humberto is expected to strengthen into a hurricane over the Atlantic, but the potential interaction with the second, weaker storm adds a layer of complexity to forecasting its ultimate track.</p>

          <p>Recently obtained architectural renderings provide a more detailed view of the new 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently under construction in the White House's East Wing. The project, significantly larger than the main White House building, is being funded by private and corporate donors, with President Trump also contributing personally. Major corporations like Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir are among those who have pledged nearly $200 million towards the construction costs. The new venue is designed to host up to 650 seated guests, greatly expanding the White House's capacity for large-scale events.</p>

          <p>Sources report that Oracle, Silver Lake, and the Abu Dhabi-based firm MGX are set to be the primary investors in the restructured TikTok U.S. entity, collectively controlling approximately 45% of the company. Under the proposed deal awaiting President Trump's final approval, TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, will retain a 19.9% stake, with the remainder held by existing ByteDance investors and new stakeholders. The new venture will feature a majority-American board of directors, and Oracle will be responsible for overseeing the security of U.S. user data, addressing national security concerns that prompted the divestiture law.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is in the process of replacing auxiliary power units on over 300 of its Airbus A320 aircraft to address the issue of toxic fumes leaking into the cabin's air supply. This multi-year initiative, now over 90% complete, responds to long-standing health and safety concerns raised by flight crews who have reported illness after exposure. These "fume events" are caused by heated engine oil leaking into the plane's bleed air system, which can lead to neurological problems. In addition to replacing the engines, Delta is also exploring the use of new synthetic turbine oils to further reduce risks to passengers and crew.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the purchase of additional shares in Danaher, a health and life sciences company, citing the stock's recent price drop as an overreaction. The article argues that despite challenges in the broader healthcare sector, Danaher's stock is now undervalued, trading at its lowest levels in five years and entering oversold territory. The decision to buy is also supported by the company's recent authorization of a significant share repurchase program, suggesting management also sees value at the current price. The club is increasing its position in the belief that the stock's issues are now fully priced in. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it tricked millions of consumers into signing up for its Prime subscription service and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million affected customers, who will receive approximately $51 each. As part of the agreement, which avoids a jury verdict, Amazon admits no wrongdoing but is now required to provide clear disclosures about Prime's terms and offer a simple cancellation method. The penalty is one of the largest ever imposed by the FTC.</p>

          <p>Spotify has removed more than 75 million "spammy" music tracks generated by artificial intelligence from its platform over the last year as part of a broader crackdown on unauthorized content. The company is enhancing its enforcement against AI-driven vocal impersonation and launching new spam filters to protect artists from deception and identity exploitation. While Spotify acknowledges that some artists may choose to license their voices for AI projects, it aims to ensure that control remains in the artists' hands. The move highlights the growing challenge tech platforms face in policing the proliferation of AI-generated content and protecting intellectual property.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Evaluating Credit Card Debt Relief Options This Fall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 14:05:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt and interest rates remaining high, many Americans are considering debt relief options. This article advises borrowers that waiting for the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut to lower their credit card APRs is likely an ineffective strategy, as card issuers rarely pass on such savings directly. Instead, it suggests exploring proactive solutions like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans, which can provide more immediate and substantial relief. Given that interest compounds daily on card balances, taking timely action can prevent debt from spiraling and is crucial for regaining financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study claims that a million-year-old human skull found in China, known as Yunxian 2, could radically alter our understanding of human evolution. Researchers now believe the skull belongs not to Homo erectus, but to an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. If this analysis is correct, it implies that our own species and Neanderthals also began to emerge at least half a million years earlier than previously thought. While some experts urge caution, the findings suggest all three advanced human species co-existed for a much longer period, potentially rewriting a key chapter of our origins.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order approving a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the United States, classifying it as a "qualified divestiture" under a recent federal law. The agreement establishes a new U.S.-based joint venture where American investors, including Oracle, will hold a majority stake, though parent company ByteDance will retain a 19.9% share. A key component of the deal involves copying and retraining TikTok's powerful content algorithm to run exclusively on U.S. user data, which will be hosted and secured by Oracle to address national security concerns about potential Chinese government influence.</p>

          <p>Starting September 30, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will end its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, requiring nearly 70 million beneficiaries to receive payments via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The agency states the transition to an all-electronic system is a modernization effort that will improve efficiency, enhance security, and save costs. While the SSA has been notifying recipients of the change, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other means to receive payments. The move follows a presidential executive order mandating the digitization of all federal payments to reduce fraud and delays.</p>

          <p>Country artist Margo Price's latest album, "Hard Headed Woman," marks a significant personal and professional reinvention, spurred by her decision to stop drinking alcohol in 2021. Price explains that this change allowed her to establish healthier boundaries, leading her to hire a new management team and replace her longtime band to refocus on her classic country sound. The new music reflects this journey of self-empowerment, with songs that are both deeply personal and politically outspoken. The album represents a deliberate return to her Nashville roots after her previous record explored more psychedelic rock influences.</p>
