          <p>Technology giant Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium aiming to keep TikTok operational in the U.S. under a potential framework deal between the U.S. and China. The precise structure remains unclear, including the level of involvement from ByteDance and control over TikTok's algorithm, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed commercial terms are agreed upon, while China's vice minister of commerce vowed to protect Chinese enterprises. This article highlights the complex negotiations and the looming September 17 divestment deadline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are exploring the possibility of using Shohei Ohtani as a relief pitcher in the playoffs, despite his primary role as a starter. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani will start, but left open scenarios for bullpen appearances, citing past examples like Walker Buehler. However, MLB's two-way rules complicate this, as using Ohtani as a reliever would mean losing him as a designated hitter once he exits the mound. The team is weighing these complex logistical and strategic challenges as the regular season concludes.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have agreed on a "framework" deal for TikTok, with commercial terms settled between private parties. Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping are scheduled to discuss and finalize the terms on Friday. This framework could potentially shift TikTok to U.S.-controlled ownership, addressing concerns about its "foreign adversary-controlled application" status. The agreement comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest or be banned in the U.S., a deadline that may require a brief extension.</p>

This surge followed President Donald Trump's positive remarks on U.S.-China trade negotiations and the announcement of a "framework" deal for TikTok. South Korea's Kospi also achieved a record high after the government reversed a capital gains tax hike. Meanwhile, U.S. major averages closed higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reaching new all-time highs as investors anticipate a Federal Reserve meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is poised to become the latest U.S. state to recognize Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday. The Legislature passed Assembly Bill 268, which would allow community colleges and public schools to close and state employees to take the day off for the five-day celebration. Introduced by Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the bill aims to acknowledge the festival's religious and historical importance and better enable the Indian diaspora to participate. Governor Gavin Newsom must sign the bill by October 12 for it to become law.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that President Donald Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before the central bank's policy committee meets to decide on interest rates. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's emergency request to pause a lower-court ruling, affirming that Cook can participate in the pivotal meeting. Trump had sought to remove Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, citing mortgage fraud allegations she denies. This decision protects the Fed's independence against presidential pressure, with two Biden-appointed judges siding against Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA is considering removing "black box" warnings from certain menopause hormone therapies, prompting a debate over their benefits and risks. Flawed 2002 research had overstated breast cancer risks by focusing on older women, but newer studies suggest treatment timing and delivery methods significantly mitigate these concerns. Dr. Mary Rosser advocates for hormone therapy as effective for perimenopausal symptoms, while a group of 76 doctors calls for more scientific assessment before changes. This article highlights the evolving understanding of medical treatments and the importance of personalized patient-doctor discussions.</p>
