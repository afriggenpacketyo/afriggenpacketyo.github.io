          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are poised for a higher open, mirroring gains on Wall Street as investor confidence in artificial intelligence continues to drive a tech rally, despite warnings of a potential AI bubble. Nvidia shares advanced after CEO Jensen Huang reported a substantial increase in AI computing demand, while AI cloud provider CoreWeave also saw its stocks jump. The Bank of England, however, cautioned against a "sharp market correction" if the AI bubble bursts. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 are expected to rise, with U.S. equity futures showing little change in early Asian trading.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail five months ago, has been captured in Atlanta following a coordinated federal operation. Convicted of a 2018 double murder, Groves was found hiding in a reinforced crawl space in an Atlanta home after a Crime Stoppers tip. Investigators believe Groves, considered a ringleader in the May 16 jailbreak, had put considerable effort into his hiding spot. Authorities are now investigating how he traveled to Atlanta and if he received assistance, bringing an end to a manhunt that exposed significant security flaws in the Orleans Parish Justice Center.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a ceasefire deal aimed at ending the Gaza war, which has been the deadliest conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. The agreement includes the release of all remaining hostages by Hamas and a withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line. Mediated by the U.S., Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, this breakthrough follows multiple failed efforts and two previous ceasefires. While the deal offers hope for an end to fighting and increased aid, the rebuilding of Gaza's devastated infrastructure will be a lengthy process, and questions about Palestinian political rights remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier's exceptional and consistent performance in the Women's Super League has ignited discussions about her deserving a starting position for the England national team. Despite being a central defensive anchor and leading the league in clearances and touches, Le Tissier has only earned eight caps since her 2022 call-up. Coach Marc Skinner praised her as an "incredible footballer" and a "rock" for United, but deferred questions about her England role. With key England defenders injured, her opportunity to prove herself on the international stage may be imminent.</p>

          <p>Sana el-Azab, a 29-year-old teacher from Gaza, has begun her educational leadership studies at Durham University in the UK after being evacuated with 33 other students. She describes the UK as "another planet" compared to Gaza, where universities are destroyed and 97% of schools are damaged. Sana previously ran a makeshift school for displaced children amidst bombing, teaching survival skills alongside academics. While relieved and grateful for the scholarship, she experiences profound guilt and struggles to concentrate, stating, "Half of my mind is in class and the other half is still in Gaza," as she hopes to return and bring change.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump discussed the potential revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a recent meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader discussions about U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, with Trump reportedly receptive to the idea. The project, which would transport 830,000 barrels of oil daily from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously blocked by both the Obama and Biden administrations and abandoned by its owner, TC Energy. While discussions were preliminary, both leaders instructed their teams to continue talks, signaling a potential shift in policy.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator has strongly refuted concerns that the company's significant deals with other artificial intelligence giants constitute "circular investments," labeling the narrative as "fundamentally flawed." Intrator asserted that major technology companies are genuinely purchasing cloud infrastructure for AI to meet client demand, emphasizing that such partnerships are common during massive infrastructure buildouts. CoreWeave, which went public in March and has seen its stock soar, recently expanded its contracts with OpenAI and Meta, and inked a substantial deal with Nvidia, a key backer. The CEO maintains that the market's fundamental drivers are enormous, dismissing the criticism as temporary.</p>
