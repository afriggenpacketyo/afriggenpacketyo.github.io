          <p>Data storage firm Seagate plans to develop a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030 to meet the growing demands of data centers fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. The company's current top-of-the-line hard drive is 36 terabytes, and the new drive would triple that capacity. Seagate believes there is strong demand for such a drive and that this technology is key to delivering the storage capacity needed by the industry, as no other technology can currently meet the market's growth needs. Seagate has been positioning itself as an AI player in recent years, capitalizing on the rise of foundational models.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a decline after Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, suggested that AI search engines may eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue indicated that Apple plans to integrate AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into its Safari browser. His comments were made during testimony in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet, which alleges illegal dominance in ad-tech markets. The lawsuit and potential remedies pose a threat to Google's advertising business, while also casting doubt on Apple's lucrative relationship with Google as the default search engine on iPhones.</p>

After initial panic and attempts to rectify the situation with Amazon, the company agreed to refund the money, and the family donated the lollipops to various organizations, including their church.
