          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors sought refuge from U.S. markets amid President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of Japanese assets, the largest net inflow since 1996. This shift was driven by institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers, seeking diversification in response to Trump's tariffs. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the surge in investment highlights Japan's appeal as a safe-haven market during times of global economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice suggests that the UK should draw inspiration from Dubai's national pride and low crime rates, citing the Emirati capital as an example of a country "getting it right." Tice, who frequently visits Dubai, praises its safety and culture of respect, echoing sentiments expressed by his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott. While acknowledging that Dubai is not "perfect," Tice argues that politicians are overlooking valuable lessons from countries that are succeeding in areas where Britain is struggling. His comments come amidst criticism of tax changes and concerns about rising crime rates in the UK.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has passed a law enabling preemptive cyberdefense, allowing the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in response to cyberattacks. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates key infrastructure operators to report cyber breaches, aiming to bolster cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. While the government will monitor IP addresses used in international communications, it is prohibited from surveilling domestic communications or message content. A new independent panel will oversee data acquisition and server neutralization, addressing concerns about potential government overreach and safeguarding personal rights.</p>

          <p>Car maker Nissan says it is open to sharing factories around the world with its Chinese state-owned partner Dongfeng as it shakes up its business. Nissan's latest job cuts came on top of 9,000 layoffs announced in November as it faces weak sales in key markets such as the US and China. This week, the struggling company said it would lay off 11,000 workers and shut seven factories but did not say where the cuts would be made. The Japanese firm, which employs thousands of people in the UK, told the BBC it could bring Dongfeng "into the Nissan production eco-system globally."</p>
