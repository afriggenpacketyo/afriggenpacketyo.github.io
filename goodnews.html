        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, emphasizes the importance of building a personal brand for career advancement, especially for those who are less outspoken. Chan suggests that a personal brand is simply what people know you for professionally and that it allows introverts to shape their own narrative and showcase their talents. She recommends starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting weekly online, to overcome the fear of self-promotion. Participating in groups and hobbies outside of work can also surprisingly contribute to and strengthen one's professional identity.</p>

          <p>This article provides a behind-the-scenes look at the passage of President Trump's $3.3 trillion legislative package, detailing the extensive Republican dealmaking required to get it through the Senate. The process, which began over a year and a half ago, involved navigating internal party disagreements, particularly over Medicaid cuts, which were resolved through a last-minute deal for a rural hospital fund. The report highlights the pressure to meet a July 4th deadline and the floor negotiations needed to secure votes from fiscal hawks and moderates, ultimately passing the bill with only three Republican defections.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This literary analysis explores the often-overlooked religious depth in the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that she was one of modern Britain's most important religious writers. Known for her witty and acerbic style, Spark's fiction was profoundly influenced by her conversion to Roman Catholicism and her lifelong reading of the Bible, particularly the Book of Job. The article posits that Spark communicated her theology through narrative form, playing God with her characters and using literary devices like prolepsis to explore themes of divine will, human shortsightedness, and final judgment, all while maintaining a signature dark, comic tone.</p>

          <p>Jason and Katie Lee, a couple from Ohio, saved $60,000 over five years to take a 13-month sabbatical in Taiwan with their young son, Forrest. Their primary motivation was to allow Forrest to bond with his paternal grandparents and for the family to experience life without the pressures of their demanding careers. The career break has been transformative, allowing Jason to focus on his mental and physical health and re-evaluate his professional goals, realizing their family can be happier with less. The family's sabbatical was extended slightly after they welcomed their second child, born in Taiwan.</p>

          <p>South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min made an instant impact in his Major League Soccer debut for Los Angeles FC, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 2-2 draw against the Chicago Fire. Just minutes after entering the game, Son drew a crucial penalty that his teammate converted to secure the draw for LAFC. Son, who recently transferred from the Premier League's Tottenham for a reported MLS record fee, was greeted with cheers and signs from fans. He expressed his enjoyment of the warm welcome from the American crowd, a contrast to the booing often experienced at away games in England.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly drafting AI agents into their cyber defense forces to detect and respond to threats. Cybersecurity experts note that these autonomous AI "teammates" can automate time-consuming tasks, filter out noise from alerts, and multiply the capabilities of human security analysts, helping to address industry-wide burnout and talent shortages. Companies like ReliaQuest are developing role-based AI agents to handle specific tasks, such as monitoring executive travel or quarantining suspicious emails. While the technology is still evolving, it is seen as a necessary tool for defenders to keep pace with AI-powered criminals.</p>

          <p>Cepee Tabibian, who helps Americans move to Europe, identifies Albania as the number one overlooked destination, citing its surprising affordability, stunning natural beauty, and welcoming visa policies. Unlike most of Europe, Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal "test drive" location. The cost of living is a fraction of that in the U.S., with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month. While still feeling authentically local, Albania has a growing and supportive expat community, and Albanians are known for being particularly friendly to Americans.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence sector is generating personal wealth faster than any previous tech wave, creating dozens of new paper billionaires this year alone. Startups like Anthropic, OpenAI, and Thinking Machines Lab have achieved massive valuations through blockbuster fundraising, contributing to a total of 498 private AI "unicorns" valued at a combined $2.7 trillion. This wealth creation is heavily concentrated in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is seeing a resurgence in its high-end real estate market. While much of this wealth is illiquid, it represents a historic opportunity for the wealth management industry as it prepares to cater to this new elite.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are offering sales tax holidays in 2025, providing shoppers temporary relief from state and sometimes local taxes on specific items like school supplies or disaster preparedness goods. While politically popular, tax experts note the benefits can be limited, as consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases rather than boosting overall economic growth. Wealthier taxpayers with flexible spending habits may benefit most, though many families plan their back-to-school shopping around these events to save money. To maximize savings, experts advise combining the tax holiday with store promotions and other discounts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of "negativity bias," the evolutionary human tendency to focus on threats and bad news, which explains why stories of progress often go unnoticed. It argues that while the media's watchdog role contributes to this focus, our own psychology is a major factor. The author suggests that consciously seeking out "good news," such as falling murder rates or fewer deaths from extreme weather, is not naive but a necessary practice. Cultivating realistic optimism can provide resilience and inspire action by reinforcing the belief that even major problems are solvable.</p>

          <p>As Miami's historic Freedom Tower prepares to reopen after a major refurbishment, a new exhibition captures the poignant stories of the Cuban refugees who passed through its doors. The article features the emotional memories of Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a traumatized five-year-old in 1967 after soldiers in Havana destroyed his teddy bear. Known as the "Ellis Island of the South," the tower processed over half a million Cubans fleeing Castro's regime. The restored building now includes interactive exhibits and personal video testimonies, aiming to preserve the legacy of those who sought freedom and built new lives in Miami.</p>
