        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York City Democratic mayoral primary is headed for a potentially lengthy ranked-choice voting tabulation process, as no candidate secured over 50% of first-choice votes. Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani held a slight lead over the crowded field, boosted by endorsements from prominent left-wing figures. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, trailed behind Mamdani in initial tallies. Ranked-choice voting, where voters rank up to five candidates, will determine the winner, with tabulations not starting until July 1 due to mail-in ballots. (not investment advice) The outcome could be influenced by factors like a recent heatwave impacting voter turnout. The election is being closely watched due to the scandal involving Cuomo and Mamdani's progressive ideas. The initial results indicate a close contest that could take time to resolve.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park in the U.K. and raided the food store, consuming a week's worth of honey. The bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building. Park keepers used recall training to guide the bears back into their enclosure, where they promptly fell asleep. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the escape, attributed to an "operational error." The wildlife park is taking the situation seriously and is implementing measures to prevent future incidents.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports that electric car and heat pump adoption is growing, but further increases are needed to meet climate goals. The committee emphasizes the need for government action to lower electricity bills to incentivize the transition to cleaner technologies. While electric car sales are nearly one-in-five of new cars sold, heat pump sales remain below target despite recent growth. The CCC also suggests that electricity costs should be reduced to encourage more people to use electric cars and heat pumps, and this could be achieved by removing charges related to renewable energy projects from household electricity bills.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously allocated to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds from the national electric vehicle infrastructure program. The Government Accountability Office previously found the administration's actions unlawful. The decision aligns with broader political debates about electric vehicle adoption and governmental support for green initiatives.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin faster than those formed billions of years ago, using data from the Gaia space telescope. The study found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time. It offers a new way to study how the galaxy has evolved.</p>

The decision aims to counter threats posed by Russia and China, and reflects a broader effort to prepare for potential direct threats to the homeland.

          <h2>Study: Childhood Vaccinations Have Avoided Millions of Deaths, But Progress Stalled</h2>

          <p>Childhood vaccinations have avoided an estimated 154 million deaths since the launch of the WHO's Essential Programme on Immunization. However, a study in The Lancet indicates that efforts to boost vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions, but vaccination efforts are recovering. India stands out as a success story, reducing the number of zero-dose children. The world's changing birth rate presents both assurances and challenges for vaccination efforts.</p>

          <h2>LAPD Allowed to Use Drones as 'First Responders' Under New Program</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Commission approved an updated policy allowing the LAPD to deploy drones on routine emergency calls. The drones are to be used in high-risk incidents, investigations, large-scale events, and natural disasters. The new policy is intended to offer responding officers real-time information about potential threats. The pilot program is set to launch next month at four police divisions. Critics remain skeptical, fearing disproportionate deployment against communities of color. The new program is being watched very closely.</p>
