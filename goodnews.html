          <p>Golfer Patrick Reed made an albatross, a very rare score of two on a par-5 hole, during the first round of the US Open. Reed's shot, a 3-wood from 286 yards, marked only the fourth albatross in US Open history since records began in 1983. Despite the impressive feat, Reed finished the day at 3-over 73, impacted by a triple bogey on the final hole. The article details the excitement of the albatross and Reed's overall performance during the round. Despite the difficulty of the course, Reed managed a memorable achievement.</p>

          <p>Thrifting is becoming increasingly popular among Americans, particularly young people, as a way to save money and reduce textile waste. The secondhand market is expected to more than double by 2028, growing much faster than the broader retail sector. Small businesses are also capitalizing on this trend, offering sewing classes and curated thrift store experiences. This shift reflects a growing awareness of the environmental impact of fast fashion and a desire for unique, affordable clothing options.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has begun, serving as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race.

Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, and issues at stake include rising living costs, political funding scandals, and regional concerns. The election features a high number of candidates, surpassing previous races in recent decades.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first in the world to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, significantly halting the progression of myeloma. The treatment, belantamab mafodotin, has shown to halt the blood cancer for nearly three times longer than current therapies while reducing side effects. Patients like Paul Silvester have described the therapy as "life-changing," allowing them to enjoy a normal life. The drug works by binding to cancerous cells and releasing a toxic payload, killing the cancer from within.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has returned to the political spotlight by launching an effort to lower rice prices, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes after Koizumi's prospects were diminished following a third-place finish in the LDP leadership race. Analysts suggest his strong media presence and reformist approach could be a lifeline for the LDP in the upcoming election. He is releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices, drawing attention to issues in the agricultural sector.</p>
