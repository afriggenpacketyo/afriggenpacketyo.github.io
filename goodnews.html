          <h2>Reform Party Gains Ground in 2025 Local Elections</h2>

          <p>In the 2025 local elections, Reform UK experienced significant gains, securing control of seven councils previously held by the Conservatives, including Lincolnshire, Staffordshire, and Kent. The Liberal Democrats also saw success, taking control of Shropshire, Oxfordshire, and Cambridgeshire, while the Greens more than doubled their number of council seats. Reform UK won both new mayoralties in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull & East Yorkshire, marking a notable shift in the political landscape, while Labour retained its mayoralties in Doncaster, North Tyneside, and the West of England, and the Conservatives lost control of 12 councils but won the race for mayor in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough from Labour. This election cycle indicates a reshaping of local political power across England.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a blackout in Spain and Portugal, theories emerged suggesting that excessive solar power was the cause, but a fact check reveals that the cause has not been conclusively clarified. While solar energy provided around 60% of Spain's power at the time, experts argue that PV systems are designed to gradually reduce feed-in rather than abruptly shut down. Some experts suggest the blackout was a system failure highlighting challenges in restructuring the energy system, while others point to capped power grid connections to France and Portugal as a contributing factor. Despite debates, technical solutions exist to operate electricity grids with high proportions of renewable energy.</p>

          <p>An article in the New York Times explores Finland's consistent ranking as the happiest country in the World Happiness Report, examining what this metric truly measures. The report relies on the Cantril Ladder question, asking individuals to rate their life satisfaction on a scale from 0 to 10, and combines these answers with factors like health, income, and social cohesion. The author reflects on personal experiences in Finland, contrasting the country's winter gloom with its celebrated happiness initiatives, and visits saunas and libraries, observing the Finnish emphasis on community and trust. The article questions the validity and interpretation of happiness rankings, suggesting that contentment and social support play a significant role in Finland's high scores.</p>

The party's success stems from tapping into widespread voter dissatisfaction, particularly in areas that heavily supported leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum. Reform UK won control of seven councils and secured a projected 30% of the vote in a nationwide election scenario, surpassing Ukip's peak popularity in 2013, while the Conservatives and Labour both experienced substantial seat losses.</p>
