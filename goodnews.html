        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study from OpenAI and Harvard researchers reveals a significant shift in how people use ChatGPT, with non-work-related conversations rising to 73% of usage. The analysis of 1.5 million conversations found that practical guidance, information seeking, and writing are the most common applications. While writing tasks dominate workplace use, the chatbot is more often used for editing and critiquing existing text rather than creating it from scratch. The study also highlights ChatGPT's growing global accessibility, with rapid adoption in lower-income countries and a narrowing gender gap among users.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook stated he is "really pleased" with the company's efforts to establish an end-to-end silicon supply chain within the United States. This initiative is part of Apple's broader commitment to invest $600 billion in domestic manufacturing over the next four years. Cook highlighted investments in facilities like Corning's Kentucky glass factory and Taiwan Semiconductor's new chip plant in the U.S. He emphasized that advanced manufacturing can be done competitively in the country and noted that Apple is in "constant communication" with the Trump administration about these projects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts predict a significant shift in how Chinese companies fund their overseas expansion, moving away from U.S. dollar bonds toward offshore yuan-denominated "dim sum" bonds. This trend is driven by high U.S. interest rates and Beijing's promotion of the yuan's internationalization amid geopolitical tensions. Issuance of dim sum bonds, which are issued in Hong Kong, is on track for a record year as Chinese corporations seek cheaper financing alternatives. Analysts believe expanding the yuan bond market aligns with China's national interest in supporting the global growth of its companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK highlights a 70-year affection for the British monarchy, influenced by his Scottish mother's admiration for their pageantry. The article details how this fascination shaped his sense of showmanship and his desire for the status associated with royalty. Throughout his career, Trump has sought connections with the royals, including reportedly offering Prince Charles a membership to his Mar-a-Lago club and attempting to court Princess Diana after her divorce. Observers suggest that for Trump, associating with the British throne represents a pinnacle of social acceptance and global legitimacy.</p>

          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, resulting in a company valuation of $8.6 billion. The pricing, which was at the midpoint of its expected range, raised $800 million for the company. After being acquired by eBay in 2007, StubHub was reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 and has since faced several delays in its attempts to go public. The successful IPO reflects a recent rebound in the market, following strong debuts from other tech companies like Klarna and Gemini. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force's second B-21 Raider stealth bomber, nicknamed "Spartan," has successfully completed its inaugural flight, marking a significant milestone for America's next-generation strategic bomber program. The B-21 is designed to replace the aging B-2 Spirit fleet and will serve as a key component of the U.S. nuclear triad and conventional global strike capabilities. The program has been noted for its efficiency, reportedly running 28% under budget, which could prompt calls to accelerate production to counter growing threats from China and Russia. The successful test flights indicate the program is progressing rapidly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that hunter-gatherer societies in southern China and Southeast Asia practiced mummification as early as 12,000 years ago. This timeline predates the earliest known examples from ancient Egypt by over 7,500 years and Chile's Chinchorro mummies by 5,000 years. Researchers analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials and found evidence that many bodies were intentionally smoke-dried over long periods. The findings reveal a complex set of mortuary practices among the region's ancient inhabitants, challenging previous understandings of the origins of this ritual.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article delves into the history of the "zarf," a Turkish word for the decorative holders used to handle small, hot cups of coffee, particularly during the Ottoman Empire. These items were not just functional but also symbols of luxury, status, and artistry, often crafted from precious metals and adorned with jewels. While the term is sometimes anachronistically applied to modern cardboard coffee sleeves, traditionalists argue the zarf represents a rich cultural ritual tied to the UNESCO-recognized Turkish coffee ceremony. Today, authentic zarfs are rare and typically reserved for special occasions, representing a bygone era of elegance in coffee consumption.</p>

          <p>An Albuquerque teacher named Juli Cobb shared an experience of kindness from an unexpected source when her car ran out of gas near a large homeless encampment. Feeling anxious and vulnerable, she was approached by three men from the encampment who offered to help. They worked together to push her car safely out of traffic, and one man, Dominic, stayed with her to ensure her safety while another biked to get her gasoline. Cobb was struck by the generosity of the men, who sought nothing in return despite their own difficult circumstances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senior Citizens League (TSCL) is forecasting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security benefits in 2026, which would be slightly above the 20-year average. This increase would raise the average retiree's monthly benefit by about $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. However, the organization notes that this boost may not be sufficient for many seniors, as 80% felt that the 2025 increase did not keep pace with their actual expenses. The official COLA, which is based on third-quarter inflation data, will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October. (not investment advice)</p>
