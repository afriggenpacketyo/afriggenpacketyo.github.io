          <p>David Kogan, the newly appointed chair of the independent football regulator, has described Sheffield Wednesday's financial and operational struggles as a "significant problem." Kogan expressed sympathy for the club's supporters, as the Championship side has failed to pay players on time on multiple occasions. The regulator is seeking powers to investigate and intervene in such situations, with Kogan stating that forcing owners to sell would be a "last resort." He emphasized the regulator's role in protecting local institutions like Sheffield Wednesday, ensuring the long-term sustainability and integrity of English football amid financial challenges and irresponsible ownership.</p>

          <p>A construction team at the Port of Long Beach made an unexpected discovery when they unearthed a World War II-era explosive device, prompting an immediate response from authorities. The finding led to the evacuation of one of the port’s six container terminals, with Long Beach police and fire departments, along with the U.S. Coast Guard, establishing a safety perimeter. The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department Bomb Squad and a U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team assessed the situation, ultimately determining the device was safe to transport. It was then moved off-site and successfully deactivated, allowing the port to resume normal operations the same night without incident.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent announcement of a first-phase peace plan between Israel and Hamas, involving hostage releases and troop withdrawals, is analyzed as a potential turning point for the Gaza conflict. The article argues that while this phase addresses the hostage crisis, it doesn't resolve deeper issues like Hamas's status or Gaza's future governance. Trump is leveraging his influence and the parties' exhaustion, alongside Israeli public desire for an end to hostilities, to push the agreement forward. His direct involvement, including potential visits to Israel, aims to bind the parties to the deal, raising questions about his broader Middle East peace ambitions.</p>
