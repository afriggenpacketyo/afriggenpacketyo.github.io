          <p>Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce has joined an activist investor group aiming to pressure the struggling theme park operator Six Flags into improving its customer experience and financial performance. The company has faced declining visitor numbers and reported a net loss of nearly $100 million in the second quarter, following its merger with Cedar Fair. The investor coalition, which owns about 9% of Six Flags, plans to engage with management to enhance marketing, modernize technology, and evaluate leadership. Kelce, a self-proclaimed lifelong fan, stated he wants to help make the parks special for the next generation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. increased by 1.5% in September, reaching the highest pace in seven months, according to the National Association of Realtors. This uptick is attributed to falling mortgage rates, which have improved housing affordability for some buyers, particularly first-timers who constituted 30% of sales. Despite the rise in sales, the market remains challenging due to stubbornly high prices and lean inventory. The median home price was $415,200, marking a 2.1% increase from the previous year and the 27th consecutive month of annual gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Conservative Ideas are Gaining Traction on College Campuses</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 11:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent graduate from Stanford University argues in this article that despite the reputation of college campuses as liberal strongholds, the real political energy and intellectual curiosity are currently found on the right. The author recounts their own journey from progressivism to conservatism, driven by a desire for open debate and a rejection of what they perceived as a stifling, offense-averse culture in left-leaning spaces. The article suggests that campus conservatism is not primarily about loyalty to Donald Trump but rather a hunger for discourse and a reaction against the perceived dogmatism of the establishment left. This trend is reportedly reflected in growing interest in conservative student groups at elite universities.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 10:42:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates on Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remaining attractive, financial planners are offering guidance on how much cash to allocate to these accounts. Experts suggest that as the Federal Reserve signals potential rate cuts, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher yields, though they caution against over-allocating funds that might be needed for emergencies. A common recommendation is to place 10% to 30% of cash savings into CDs, carefully matching the CD term lengths to specific short-to-medium-term financial goals. This strategy balances earning higher returns with maintaining liquidity for unforeseen expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Human rights advocate and philanthropist George Soros has been awarded the European Civil Rights Prize of the Sinti and Roma for his long-standing support of Roma communities across Europe. The prize, accepted on his behalf by his son Alex, recognizes the work of the Open Society Foundations in combating discrimination and expanding access to education and justice for the Roma people. In a statement, Soros highlighted the centuries of marginalization endured by the Roma and reaffirmed his belief that open societies must protect the rights of all people.

          <h2>Quantum Computing Stocks Rise on Reports of Potential U.S. Government Investment</h2>

          <p>Shares of several quantum-computing firms, including IonQ, D-Wave, and Rigetti Computing, surged following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking equity stakes in these companies. This potential move aligns with a recent strategy of government investment in industries deemed vital to national security, such as rare earths and advanced semiconductors. The administration argues that the government should benefit from the success of companies that receive federal funding. This reflects a growing focus on technological competition with China, as quantum computing is viewed as a critical future technology with significant economic and security implications.

          <h2>American Airlines Appoints Industry Veteran Nat Pieper as New Commercial Chief</h2>

          <p>American Airlines has hired Nat Pieper, a veteran with nearly three decades of experience in the airline industry, to serve as its new chief commercial officer. The appointment comes as the carrier's profits have been lagging behind its main rivals, Delta and United. Pieper previously held high-level roles at Northwest, Delta, and Alaska Airlines, and most recently led the Oneworld airline alliance. He is tasked with overseeing American's commercial strategy, loyalty program, and network planning, filling a role that has been vacant since the ousting of the former CCO in 2024 after a controversial business travel strategy backfired.</p>

          <h2>New Trump Tax Law Creates More Lucrative Exit Strategies for Small Business Owners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 10:30:01 EDT</div>

          <p>A new tax law enacted by the Trump administration has significantly expanded the benefits of qualified small business stock (QSBS), offering a more lucrative way for many entrepreneurs to cash out. The legislation raises the tax-free gain cap from $10 million to $15 million, lowers the required stock holding period from five to three years, and increases the asset cap for eligible businesses to $75 million. These changes mean more small businesses, particularly those structured as C corporations, can now qualify for substantial capital gains tax savings when they sell their company. This could incentivize many owners to rethink their exit strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a year of tense relations over trade and support for Ukraine, the U.S. and the European Union are now demonstrating a more united front against Russia. Both Washington and Brussels announced complementary sanctions packages this week targeting Russia's crucial oil and gas industry. According to the U.S. Ambassador to the EU, this coordinated pressure is a direct response to Russia's refusal to seriously negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. This alignment marks a notable shift from earlier in the year when President Trump accused the EU of unfair trade practices, suggesting a shared geopolitical goal is currently overriding economic disputes.</p>

          <p>England has won its T20 series against New Zealand 1-0 after the third and final match in Auckland was abandoned due to persistent rain, with only 3.4 overs played. This follows a rain-affected first match, leaving England's dominant 65-run victory in the second game as the series decider. Captain Harry Brook stated the tour was still "very worthwhile," emphasizing the benefits of team bonding activities off the field. The series victory is Brook's first overseas as England's white-ball captain, providing some positive momentum as the team builds towards the T20 World Cup in February.</p>
