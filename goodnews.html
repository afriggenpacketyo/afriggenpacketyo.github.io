          <p>Nintendo has reported a significant financial upswing, with its fiscal first-quarter revenue more than doubling year-over-year to 572.3 billion yen. This impressive growth is primarily attributed to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which sold 5.82 million units since its release in early June. The company's operating profit also surpassed analyst expectations, reflecting strong market confidence and consumer excitement for the new hardware. Nintendo's stock has rallied approximately 40% this year, as the company anticipates selling 15 million Switch 2 units by March 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese swimmer Yu Zidi, aged 12, has become the youngest medalist in the history of the World Aquatics Championships. She earned a bronze medal by participating in the heats of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, where China finished third in the final. Her participation has sparked a debate within the swimming community, as she was granted an exception to the minimum age rule of 14 due to her exceptional qualifying times. While some celebrate her as a young prodigy, others express concern about the potential long-term effects of high-level competition at such a young age.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a novel anti-poaching initiative, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. The project, led by the University of the Witwatersrand, aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports, thereby deterring traffickers. After successful trials confirmed the method is safe for the animals, the team officially launched the campaign by treating five rhinos. Conservationists hope this innovative technique will provide a powerful new tool to protect the declining species from the high levels of poaching in the country.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy delivered a commanding performance in their Leagues Cup debut, defeating Xolos de Tijuana 5-2 at home. Joseph Paintsil was the standout player for the Galaxy, scoring two goals and providing a crucial assist, rebounding after having a penalty saved earlier in the match. Matheus Nascimento, Gabriel Pec, and Marco Reus also scored for the Los Angeles side, which has been struggling in its domestic league campaign. Despite a two-goal effort from Tijuana's young talent Gilberto Mora, the Galaxy's offense proved too powerful, securing a decisive win in the cross-league tournament.</p>

          <p>The focus of the international space industry appears to be shifting from the Moon to Mars, with lunar missions increasingly framed as a "stepping stone" to the red planet. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration, the long-term rhetoric from figures like Donald Trump and Elon Musk emphasizes colonizing Mars. This new space race involves more players than the original, with China and the European Space Agency also setting ambitious timelines for Mars missions. The article suggests that as national agencies pivot towards Mars, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to strengthen their military relationship, with a new joint ammunition factory in Kuwait expected to be inaugurated soon. At a reception marking the founding of China's People's Liberation Army, a Kuwaiti defense official called the factory a "milestone" in cooperation between the two nations. The countries also plan to expand joint military training programs that began in 2019. This development highlights Beijing's increasing engagement and deepening security ties in the Gulf region, building on a military cooperation agreement first signed with Kuwait, a key U.S. ally, in 1995.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's process for handling the rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh noted that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass a gridlocked Congress, more legal challenges are inevitable. He argued that the court has adapted by increasing its process, including writing more and scheduling oral arguments for these urgent cases. He stated he believes his colleagues are thoughtfully engaging with difficult issues and that collegiality among the justices remains strong.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nepal, and Nicaragua. The ruling provides a reprieve for these individuals, who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years, some for decades. In her order, the judge stated that the administration's decision appeared to be motivated by racial animus and failed to properly review current conditions in the home countries. The protections will now remain in place at least until a November hearing.</p>
