          <h2>Wimbledon Match Halted by Electronic Line-Calling System Malfunction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed. The malfunction missed a clear "out" call on a crucial point, leading the chair umpire to order a replay, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova who claimed the game was "stolen" from her. Although she ultimately won the match, the incident raised questions about the reliability of the new technology and the umpire's decision not to overrule the system's failure. The All England Club later attributed the issue to operator error.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has introduced the ID. Buzz autonomous van, a vehicle designed for fleet operations like public transit and corporate mobility services. Equipped with SAE Level 4 autonomy, it utilizes 27 sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar, to achieve a 360-degree view for safe navigation without a human driver in certain conditions. The van, developed with technology from Mobileye, features a spacious four-seat cabin and is aimed at addressing transit challenges like driver shortages. Pilot programs are launching in Hamburg, with a wider rollout planned for 2026.</p>

          <p>India defeated England by a commanding 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston, leveling the series at 1-1. Despite a resilient 88 from England's Jamie Smith, the host's batting lineup could not withstand India's bowling attack on the final day. Indian bowler Akash Deep was instrumental, claiming a five-wicket haul and finishing with match figures of 6-99 to lead his team to a historic first Test victory at the venue. The result sets up an exciting continuation of the series, which moves to Lord's next.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph. The storm, the third of the Atlantic hurricane season, is moving north and is expected to dissipate soon, with all tropical storm warnings being discontinued. While weakening, Chantal is still producing scattered showers, thunderstorms, and heavy rain across parts of North and South Carolina. Flood watches remain in effect for some areas due to the potential for flash flooding from rainfall totals of up to 6 inches.</p>

          <p>National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the Trump administration's recently signed domestic policy bill, asserting it will fuel significant economic growth and ultimately shrink the deficit. Hassett dismissed contrary analyses from institutions like the CBO and the Tax Foundation, arguing their models have been historically inaccurate and fail to account for the bill's pro-growth effects. He also defended the bill's work requirements for Medicaid, stating that creating jobs is the best way to get people insured and that fears of massive coverage loss are unfounded.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a dramatic first home victory at the British Grand Prix, capitalizing on a penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri. Piastri, who had led for much of the rain-affected race, received a 10-second penalty for erratic driving during a safety-car restart, allowing Norris to pass him after the final pit stop. The chaotic race, held in front of a record crowd at Silverstone, also saw Nico Hulkenberg achieve his first-ever podium finish for Sauber. The win reduces Norris's deficit to Piastri in the drivers' championship.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" are reflecting on the film's notoriously difficult production and its lasting impact on Hollywood. Actor Richard Dreyfuss and screenwriter Carl Gottlieb recalled the challenging shoot on the open Atlantic, a malfunctioning mechanical shark, and a budget that more than doubled. Despite the on-set struggles, the 1975 film, directed by a young Steven Spielberg, became the first summer blockbuster and redefined the industry. The movie's simple premise of three men against a shark created a cultural phenomenon that continues to resonate with audiences today.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have announced the discovery of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico, believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. Located in the northern Barranca province, the site is thought to have connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. The discovery is significant for shedding light on the development of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization. Researchers unearthed 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential buildings, along with artifacts like clay sculptures and seashell necklaces.</p>

While potential investors are concerned about geopolitical risks, the appeal of the wealthy U.S. market and the need to bypass tariffs are driving interest in establishing production facilities within the country.
