          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These nanoparticles convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, though the resulting images are somewhat blurred. While not as powerful as night vision goggles, these lenses could be used in surgical procedures, encryption, or rescue operations, and they function even better with closed eyes. The ability to see in the dark could also be useful in counterfeit protection by revealing invisible features or inks on documents.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul defeated Alexei Popyrin in straight sets at the French Open, ending Popyrin's run in the tournament.

Popyrin, seeded 25th, struggled with unforced errors, while Paul capitalized on key moments to secure the win. This victory makes Paul the first American man to reach the quarter-finals at the French Open since 2003, marking a significant milestone in his career, as he progresses to face either Ben Shelton or Carlos Alcaraz.</p>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies from the Defense Ministry for security-related technology research since fiscal year 2015. The funding aims to support research amid budget constraints faced by domestic universities, particularly those outside Tokyo. The program's budget has increased over the years, with the allocation for fiscal year 2023 reaching 11.4 billion yen. Some universities are using the funds for projects such as developing sheets that absorb harmful gases and systems that use AI to detect cyberattacks. Despite the benefits, concerns have been raised about the potential military applications of the research.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the ‚Äúghost ancestors‚Äù of modern Tibetans to the southwestern province of Yunnan through ancient DNA analysis. The study verifies a hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. The findings fill a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia, identifying one of the Tibetan Plateau‚Äôs ‚Äúghost ancestors‚Äù for the first time from a genetic perspective. The research sheds light on the migration and adaptation of people to the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The potential closure of Joann craft-supply stores raises concerns about the accessibility of crafting materials and the loss of community spaces. The expansion of chains like Joann has already diminished local mom-and-pop shops, leaving fewer options for in-person access to supplies. Crafting is a tactile experience, and online ordering cannot fully replace the ability to see and touch materials before purchasing. The disappearance of Joann may discourage creative pursuits and reduce opportunities for social connection, as crafting often involves family traditions and community building.</p>
