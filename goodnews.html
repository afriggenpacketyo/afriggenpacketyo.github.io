          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession following a contraction in the first quarter. This growth, which exceeded analysts' forecasts, was largely driven by a 5.5% year-over-year increase in the manufacturing sector, possibly due to businesses accelerating exports amid trade uncertainties. Despite this positive performance, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant global economic risks for the latter half of the year and announcing new business support grants.

          <p>A team of archaeologists has unearthed multistory tower houses in the lost Egyptian city of Imet, located in the Nile Delta. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, researchers identified the dense architectural remains, which date back to the Ptolemaic Period around 332 B.C. These structures, supported by thick foundation walls, suggest the city was a thriving, densely populated urban center. The excavation also revealed granaries and a ceremonial road, providing new insights into the urban planning, religious life, and economic activity of ancient Egypt.</p>

The article details how Paul and his partner Nakisa Bidarian have leveraged Paul's massive social media following to build a financially self-sustaining promotional company, a rarity in the sport. While MVP is working to develop a roster of fighters beyond Paul himself, particularly in women's boxing, the Taylor-Serrano event serves as a major proof of concept for their business model.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI. This declaration comes amid growing questions about the integration of his various companies. Musk did, however, suggest that Tesla might hold a future shareholder vote on whether the automaker should directly invest in xAI. This follows recent moves to bring his businesses closer, including merging xAI with social media platform X and announcing plans to integrate the Grok AI chatbot into Tesla vehicles.</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of a significant slowdown. While stating that the path for rates is "downward," he emphasized a "gradual and careful" approach. The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of slack, with job vacancies falling to their lowest level since 2021 and the economy contracting in May. This rhetoric suggests a rate cut at the Bank's next meeting in August is increasingly likely. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing expectations and bolstered by strong shipments to non-U.S. markets and a temporary tariff reprieve with the United States. While exports to the U.S. fell for a third month, the decline eased significantly. The data also showed a notable surge in exports of steel, rare earths, and vehicles. Despite the positive figures, economists remain cautious, forecasting that the export momentum could weaken due to continued uncertainty over U.S. trade policies and the potential for front-loading effects to fade.

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged past the $120,000 mark to a new record high, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing optimism for clearer U.S. crypto regulations. The rally is partly attributed to the upcoming 'Crypto Week' in the U.S. Congress, where lawmakers will deliberate on bills aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets, a move supported by the White House. Analysts believe strong institutional buying is fueling the momentum, with some setting year-end price targets as high as $160,000. (not investment advice)</p>
