        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing a "necessity for generational change," the 78-year-old Democrat stated his decision was influenced by observing the challenges faced by older party leaders. Nadler, first elected in 1992, served as the chair of the House Judiciary Committee and was a key figure in Donald Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up a competitive race for his seat and reflects a broader conversation within the Democratic party about leadership succession.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers for Monday night's Powerball drawing have been announced, with an estimated jackpot of $1.2 billion, the fifth-largest in the game's history. The numbers drawn were 8, 23, 25, 40, 53, with a Powerball of 5. It was not immediately known if a winning ticket was sold for the grand prize, which has a cash value of approximately $498.4 million. The jackpot grew to its massive size after no one matched all six numbers in the previous drawing on Saturday, continuing a winless streak that began in late May.</p>

          <p>A research team in Beijing has designed a potential solution for doing laundry in space: a compact, detergent-free washing machine. The 12kg device, developed by the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre, uses a combination of ultrasonic mist and ozone to clean clothes. This innovative method requires only 400ml of water per cycle, a critical feature given the scarcity of water on space missions. The machine uses ultraviolet light to generate ozone as a disinfectant, allowing clothes to be sterilized and worn multiple times before needing to be cleaned again.</p>

The victory, his quickest ever in a Grand Slam, sets up the first all-Italian men's quarter-final in a major, where he will face Lorenzo Musetti. Sinner's dominant play extended his winning streak at hard-court Grand Slams to 25 matches. Bublik, who had beaten Sinner previously, struggled significantly, committing 13 double faults and numerous errors, unable to challenge the defending champion's relentless pressure.</p>

          <h2>Disabled MP Highlights Accessibility Challenges Within UK Parliament Buildings</h2>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, is advocating for better accessibility within the historic Houses of Parliament. Tidball, who was elected last July, describes the challenges she faces daily, from heavy doors with round handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets. While acknowledging that some changes have been made, she argues that Parliament must do more to reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities. Her experience has been submitted as evidence to the House of Commons Modernisation Committee, which is reviewing how to make the estate more inclusive.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has been cleared for contact and stated he expects to play in the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Harris sustained an eye injury in a Fourth of July fireworks accident but reassured reporters that his vision was not affected and the injury was superficial. Having never missed an NFL game in his career, Harris is now ramping up his workload in practice after being on the non-football injury list. Coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed there is a possibility Harris will play, describing his recent performance in practice as "really, really good."</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, stands as a celebrated icon of national park architecture over a century after its construction in 1904. Known as the largest log cabin in the world, its design by architect Robert Reamer utilized twisted, unconventional wood pieces, described as "freaks of the forest," to create its unique rustic style. The inn has hosted presidents and millions of tourists, and its influence is seen in the design of other famous park lodges across the United States. Preservation efforts focus on maintaining its historic character while ensuring its structural integrity for future generations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly being prepared to transport hundreds of children from Texas. Attorneys for the children argued the government was attempting to bypass legal protections that allow minors to seek humanitarian relief in the U.S. The judge's order, which will last 14 days, cited the government's hurried plan to remove the children over a holiday weekend as justification for the extraordinary measure.</p>

This revelation served as a powerful lesson for Odell about the unseen impact of one's work.

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with the total outlay for the summer transfer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by several major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's British record £125 million move to Liverpool from Newcastle. This summer's spending significantly eclipses the previous year's total and is more than the combined spending of the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy. The trend highlights the immense financial power of England's top flight compared to its European counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool has shattered the record for the most money spent by a single club in a transfer window, with an outlay of £415 million under new manager Arne Slot. This aggressive spending, which included the British record signing of Alexander Isak, marks a significant shift from the more cautious approach under former manager Jurgen Klopp. The club's strategy was fueled by a build-up of funds, strong commercial growth, and a desire to capitalize on their recent title success. The window was also shaped by the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, which necessitated unplanned changes to the squad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian bloc including China, Russia, and India, has formally decided to establish a development bank. The move is designed to insulate the ten member nations from risks associated with the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system and to accelerate key infrastructure projects. Analysts view the creation of this concessional lender as a logical step for the bloc, enhancing its economic independence and strengthening its position as a counterweight to Western financial influence.
