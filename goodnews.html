        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. tariff receipts reached a record $16.3 billion in April, marking an 86% increase from March and more than double the amount from a year prior, largely due to President Trump's trade war policies. These increased customs duties have contributed to a surplus of $258.4 billion for the month, up 23% from the previous year, thereby reducing the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.05 trillion. Despite the surplus, high interest rates on the national debt continue to pose a significant budgetary challenge, with net interest totaling $89 billion for April. This article highlights how trade policies are impacting government finances amid broader economic challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent trade agreements with China and the United Kingdom, the average effective tariff rate in the U.S. remains at 17.8%, the highest since 1934, according to a Yale Budget Lab report. This high tariff rate, equivalent to a 15.4 percentage point increase since before Trump's second term, is expected to cost the average household $2,800 in the short run. While the China trade deal led to a reduction in duties from 145% to 30%, the deal with the U.K. had minimal impact on overall tariff rates. This article suggests that consumers and businesses will likely adjust their purchasing behavior to mitigate the higher costs associated with these tariffs.</p>

          <p>Coinbase shares surged 8% after the announcement that the cryptocurrency exchange will join the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial Services, effective May 19. This move reflects Coinbase's growing significance in the U.S. financial system, driven by bitcoin's rising value and the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs. While Coinbase's stock has been volatile since its 2021 direct listing, its inclusion in the S&P 500 is expected to increase its value as funds tracking the index add it to their portfolios.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved three new natural food colorings: Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, for use in various foods and drinks. These dyes are considered safer alternatives to synthetic dyes, which some limited research has linked to behavioral issues in children. Experts indicate that these additives are generally safe, especially in small amounts; however, some adults with kidney stones may want to limit their consumption of products containing calcium phosphate. The article notes that these new approvals will provide food manufacturers with more options for switching from artificial to natural dyes, though natural colors can be more expensive and may fade more easily.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer's recent language on immigration signals an acknowledgement of past failures and a response to public disillusionment. His statement that "we risk becoming an island of strangers" reflects a shift from traditional Labour rhetoric, potentially influenced by the rise of Reform UK and concerns about economic growth. The prime minister's focus on legal and illegal migration precedes an anticipated deal with the EU, including a youth mobility plan, highlighting the crucial need for a sustained downward trend in net migration numbers to maintain credibility.</p>

          <p>Shares of major toy makers, including Mattel, Hasbro, Jakks, and Funko, experienced a significant rally after the U.S. agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on China.
