          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second straight Stanley Cup championship with a decisive 5-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, marking the NHL's first repeat winners since 2020-21. Sam Reinhart's standout performance included four goals, a feat last achieved in 1957, while Matthew Tkachuk sealed the win with a final goal. Goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance, allowing only one goal, further solidified the Panthers' dominance, leading to celebrations filled with rats thrown on the ice. The team's success is attributed to a strong core of players and strategic acquisitions, positioning them as a potential modern-day dynasty with their consistent finals appearances and recent championships. </p>

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the current owner of the L.A. Dodgers, for an estimated $10 billion, a record sale for a sports team. Jeanie Buss will remain as the team's governor, representing the Lakers in league matters, while Walter, also involved with the Professional Women's Hockey League and other sports franchises, will assume majority ownership. Jerry Buss originally purchased the Lakers in 1979 for $67.5 million, transforming them into a globally recognized franchise, and the sale to Walter marks a significant shift after years of family ownership. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its "wait-and-see" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to worsen in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year, mirroring its March projections. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions and low inflation, but cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow growth. The Fed expects inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that American taxpayers will not fund the appeal of President Donald Trump's $83 million defamation case, denying his request to have Justice Department lawyers argue on his behalf. The case stems from columnist E. Jean Carroll's accusation that Trump sexually assaulted her in the mid-1990s and defamed her in 2019, allegations Trump denies. DOJ lawyers argued that some of Trump's alleged conduct fell within his presidential role, justifying Justice Department defense, but the court rejected this argument. Oral arguments for the appeal are scheduled for June 24. </p>

          <p>Trent Alexander-Arnold made his debut for Real Madrid following his exit from Anfield, adopting his first name on his jersey and speaking Spanish at his unveiling. He had a shaky start, caught out of position multiple times, but improved as the game progressed, contributing to Real's goal by intercepting a pass. Although he lost the ball more than any other player, he also played more crosses and entered the final third more than his teammates. His passing accuracy improved significantly in the second half as he played further forward in the attacking midfield. </p>
