          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that a framework deal has been reached between private parties regarding the U.S. operations of TikTok, with commercial terms agreed upon. The deal, aimed at addressing national security concerns, will be finalized in a meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. This development comes after months of negotiations and a looming deadline for parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. business or face a shutdown. The agreement could lead to a U.S.-controlled ownership structure for the popular social media platform, averting a potential ban in the country.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has purchased approximately $1 billion worth of the company's stock, his first open-market buy since 2020 and his largest ever by value. The acquisition of 2.57 million shares was seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence, causing Tesla's stock to jump over 6% in trading. This move comes as Musk seeks greater control over the company to steer its focus toward artificial intelligence and robotics. The purchase also follows a period where the stock has been weighed down by slumping sales and concerns over Musk's political activities impacting the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Investing in Gold May Still Be Prudent Despite Record-High Prices</h2>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching near-record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, some financial experts argue it remains a worthwhile investment. They suggest that factors like a depreciating U.S. dollar, persistent inflation risks, and the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts could drive prices even higher. Gold is also valued as a low-risk portfolio diversifier that is not tied to the stock market, offering a hedge against economic uncertainty. For those hesitant about the high entry cost, experts point to accessible options like fractional gold, ETFs, and mutual funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining the ranks of Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock value surged following a recent antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared, avoiding a forced divestiture of its Chrome browser. This milestone, reached approximately 20 years after Google's IPO, comes as the company navigates increased competition from AI technologies like OpenAI and faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe.

          <p>A behavioral psychology expert advises against using generic conversation starters like "How are you?" to build genuine connections, as they often lead to scripted, unmemorable responses. Instead, she recommends asking more engaging questions that prompt storytelling, such as "What's the highlight of your week?" or asking about fun weekend plans. The expert also emphasizes the importance of body language, like maintaining an open stance and mirroring gestures, to signal trustworthiness. Practicing these techniques in low-stakes daily interactions can help make them feel more natural and effective in building rapport.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut expected, mortgage experts are advising prospective homebuyers on how to navigate the changing market. Key recommendations include getting a freshly updated pre-approval to reflect increased buying power, comparing offers from multiple lenders to secure the best terms, and locking in a favorable rate quickly. Conversely, experts warn against assuming one's current lender will offer the best deal, trying to time the market by waiting for rates to fall further, and overextending one's budget based on a new, higher pre-approval amount.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a majority of job seekers now use AI in their application process, career coaches caution against placing "blind faith" in these tools. Experts warn that AI can 'hallucinate' or fabricate information to fit a job description, leading to resumes with exaggerated or inaccurate details that candidates cannot defend in an interview. Furthermore, AI-generated applications often share a generic structure, making it difficult for candidates to stand out. Recruiters advise using AI as a tool for polishing language rather than for initial drafting, stressing the importance of proofreading and ensuring the final product authentically reflects the applicant's experience.</p>
