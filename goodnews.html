          <h2>China Announces Policy Easing Measures to Boost Economy Amid Trade Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced several policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for banks, to stimulate economic growth amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and the reserve requirement ratio, injecting substantial liquidity into the market. These measures aim to support key sectors like technology and real estate, along with consumption and elderly care. While analysts believe these steps signal urgency, they also note that new fiscal policy measures are absent and may only be introduced if economic conditions worsen. Optimism is rising that China can continue to de-escalate the trade war.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have largely ignored recent military strikes against Pakistan, driven by investor confidence in India's strong growth prospects and structural reforms. Analysts believe that resilient domestic demand and solid macroeconomic fundamentals continue to make India an attractive investment destination. Progress in trade talks with major partners, including a free trade agreement with the U.K., is also bolstering market sentiment. Investors anticipate a swift de-escalation of tensions, limiting any potential fallout, though experts caution that a wider conflict could negatively impact market stability.
