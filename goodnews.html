          <h2>Newark Air Traffic Control Faces Another Outage Amid System Overhaul Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 11:56:45 EDT</div>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport experienced another air traffic control outage, this time lasting approximately 90 seconds, which follows a week of issues for travelers in New Jersey. This incident occurred shortly after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the Trump administration's plan to modernize the U.S. air traffic control system. United Airlines has been limiting flights to and from Newark due to the ongoing problems. The FAA insists that Newark airspace remains safe, but the outages are causing delays as traffic is slowed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate analysts are observing a notable decrease in apartment renter turnover in large urban markets. Traditionally, about half of apartment renters in these areas move when their leases expire, but current turnover is around 30%. Factors contributing to this trend include an unaffordable for-sale market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, moving costs, and a preference for larger suburban apartments. This low turnover allows landlords to increase renewal pricing and improves cash flow due to reduced turnover expenses, such as repairs and cleaning.</p>

          <p>Republicans are exploring Medicaid spending cuts to advance President Trump's agenda, but options are dwindling. House Speaker Mike Johnson has ruled out significant cuts to the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion. The primary remaining option, limiting states' use of a tax loophole to boost federal Medicaid funding, would largely impact poorer, Southern states. These states could face budget shortfalls, potentially leading to reduced health insurance coverage or cuts to hospital payments. The final budget package is expected to require one of these substantial cuts to meet Republican goals, with Medicaid's financing system at the center of the debate.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has been a popular investment choice due to its market-beating returns and disciplined management. As Buffett prepares to retire, the company is undergoing a significant transition. Since Buffett took over in 1965, Berkshire's stock has seen a remarkable 5,502,284% gain, while first-quarter operating earnings were reported at $9.64 billion. The company's stock underperformed expectations due to a decline in insurance underwriting profit, and Berkshire has two classes of stock: Class A and Class B.</p>

          <p>The UK political scene is witnessing a shift as the Reform party gains traction, challenging the dominance of Labour and the Conservatives. Labour's support has declined since their victory last summer, and the Reform party held the voting intention lead for the entirety of February. The Conservative's support remains robust with pensioners, but Reform's influence is tightening in this demographic as well. The Telegraph has compiled polls from a range of pollsters approved by the British Polling Council, and the Prime Minister's approval rating has dropped considerably.</p>
