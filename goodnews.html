          <p>Financial experts suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to ensure a car purchase is affordable and to avoid owing more than the vehicle is worth. This framework recommends a down payment of at least 20%, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring total monthly vehicle expenses do not exceed 10% of your gross income. While acknowledging that high car prices can make these targets challenging, financial planners emphasize that adhering to them helps prioritize saving for appreciating assets over a depreciating one like a car.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new book, "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a compelling framework for understanding the U.S.-China rivalry, contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China has achieved remarkable progress in physical infrastructure and manufacturing, its focus on national power often comes at the expense of individual happiness, contributing to issues like high youth unemployment. Conversely, Wang suggests the U.S. has become physically stagnant and overly procedural. He provocatively proposes that it is time for the U.S. to learn from some of China's successes in dynamism and industrial policy.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the system to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but anticipate it will remain over open waters for the next several days. The storm's current projected track shows it moving north of the Caribbean and away from the U.S. mainland. However, it could pass to the east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island.</p>

          <p>A remodeled home in Hermosa Beach, California, serves as a case study for achieving net-zero energy consumption for less than the cost of a traditional remodel. The "Green Idea House" utilizes solar panels, strategic architectural design like roof overhangs for passive heating and cooling, and all-electric appliances to generate more energy than it consumes. The homeowner emphasizes that the project used standard materials and off-the-shelf technologies, but required significant research, planning, and persistence with contractors. The house highlights practical lessons for sustainable living, though it also shows the need for adaptation as climate change accelerates.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is celebrated as the guiding force who led the franchise through difficult times, including a bankruptcy period, to an era of sustained success. He made his debut when the team hadn't won a postseason series in 20 years and leaves with the Dodgers clinching their 13th consecutive postseason berth. With a career ERA of 2.54, three Cy Young Awards, and a central role in the team's revival, Kershaw is remembered as a generational talent.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars and palm weevil larvae are not just a delicacy but a vital food staple, providing essential protein and vitamins. In the markets of Kinshasa, these insects are sold fresh or fried as a popular snack and meal component, often seen as a more accessible and organic alternative to expensive meat. Villagers harvest the insects from forests, and some NGOs are now farming them commercially to supply orphanages and meet growing demand. This traditional practice, which has expanded in recent decades, offers a sustainable solution to food scarcity in the region.</p>

          <p>Renowned television producer David E. Kelley is doubling down on his commitment to filming in California, keeping all of his current and upcoming projects in the Los Angeles area despite industry trends of relocating for cheaper costs. After devastating wildfires affected his crew, Kelley's production company decided to stay and reinvest in the local community rather than move. This decision was solidified by recent enhancements to the state's film and television tax credit program. Projects like "Big Little Lies" and "The Lincoln Lawyer" will continue to be produced locally, providing crucial jobs and signaling confidence in Hollywood's future as a production hub.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" explores the concept of "limerence," a state of profound romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional highs and lows. While this state can be a natural part of falling in love, it can become a form of addiction if the object of affection is unavailable or unreliable, leading to anxiety and craving. Bellamy offers strategies to break the cycle, such as limiting contact, consciously turning positive daydreams into negative scenarios, and redirecting energy toward new personal goals. The key is to recognize the obsession as an internal process that can be managed and overcome.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrats Face Strategic Questions After Election Success Fueled by Leader's Stunts</h2>

          <p>As the UK's Liberal Democrats gather for their party conference, they are grappling with their future strategy following significant gains in the last general election. Leader Sir Ed Davey's playful and unconventional stunts, such as bungee-jumping and jet-skiing, successfully garnered media attention and helped the party win seats. However, new polling suggests that a majority of voters, including many Lib Dem supporters, now view these antics as making the party look less serious. The party must now decide how to build on its success, expand its policy platform beyond care issues, and define its identity to appeal to more voters without relying solely on stunts.</p>
