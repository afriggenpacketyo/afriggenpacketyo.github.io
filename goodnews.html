          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have been sent back to China, leaving only two pandas in the entire country. The departure of the 24-year-old female Rauhin and her three offspring marks the conclusion of a successful joint breeding program that began in 1994. The program, a collaboration with the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, has raised 17 cubs, the most outside of China. Thousands of visitors attended a farewell ceremony, expressing sadness over their departure but wishing them well.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that consuming a traditional Japanese diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, and soy products, is associated with a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, surveyed nearly 12,500 employees and found a notable correlation even after accounting for other potential factors. Researchers suggest that specific components of the diet, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and nutrients in seaweed and soy, may positively impact mental well-being. The findings open a new avenue for public health measures aimed at preventing depression.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has successfully captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Antoine Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has been called the worst in recent state history and has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management. With only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large, authorities are offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>The BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," created by and starring real-life sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show offers a dark, humorous look at a financially struggling, all-female household navigating life and relationships. Sadler, the writer, explains that the series is inspired by their own upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene, satirizing the idea that being single is a fate worse than death. The comedy is known for its unflinching approach to taboo subjects like mental health and abortion, all filtered through a lens of scheming and dark wit.</p>

Built in 1908 by the Russian Empire, the historic redbrick structure will open in July as Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate, a six-suite wellness retreat. The building, which is the only surviving imperial Russian consulate in Japan, was purchased and restored by a Nagoya-based company with strong personal ties to Hakodate.

Known for being packed with minerals and dietary fiber, the cactus is being hailed as a potential "superfood." Research from Chubu University has shown that cactus pear powder can enhance immune function in mice, suggesting potential health benefits for humans.

          <p>Scientists are reviving a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy, which uses viruses that prey on bacteria to treat infections. With the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs, this approach offers a potential alternative to conventional drugs. A BBC correspondent participated in a project by collecting water samples, one of which, taken from a toilet, contained a phage capable of killing bacteria from a patient with a recurring urinary tract infection. While the science is promising, researchers caution that developing phage therapy for widespread clinical use is still in its early stages, though regulators are beginning to establish guidelines.</p>

Schafer then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with astonishment and praise.

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders aimed at punishing an elite law firm, calling the action "unconstitutional from beginning to end." The ruling, in a case brought by the firm Susman Godfrey, marks another legal defeat for the administration's campaign against firms that have represented clients or causes the president opposes. Judges in all four lawsuits filed by different firms have found the orders, which impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances, to be an attack on constitutional rights and the independence of the American legal system.</p>

Healy engaged in his typical verbose and self-deprecating banter, at one point ironically declaring himself the "best songwriter of my generation."

Cramer notes that factors like the popularity of weight-loss drugs, cannabis use, and immigration policies are impacting alcohol sales, creating a complex environment for companies and investors.

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. This move, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, is designed to counter the long-term trend of productions leaving Hollywood for other locations like Britain, Canada, and other U.S. states that offer more generous incentives. Industry unions have warned that California has lost thousands of entertainment jobs in recent years. The expanded tax credit is seen as a crucial step to support local workers and bring production back home.</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock currently lagging and facing headwinds from U.S. tariffs on China, analyst Jim Cramer advises investors not to give up on the company. He acknowledges concerns over manufacturing costs, potential impacts on iPhone prices, and a lack of groundbreaking AI announcements at a recent conference. However, Cramer expresses faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and points to Apple's history of rebounding strongly after periods of uncertainty. He argues that the company's expected earnings growth outpaces the S&P 500, suggesting that significant dips in the stock price have historically been excellent buying opportunities.
