          <p>In an attempt to break the impasse in nuclear negotiations, Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, according to Iranian officials. This proposal was presented to American envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman, aiming to allow Iran to continue producing civilian-grade fuel under increased monitoring. The plan seeks to establish a permanent consortium where Iran enriches uranium to a low grade and ships it to Arab countries for civilian use, with potential oversight from other nations, including the United States. This initiative aims to provide a more lasting solution than the 2015 nuclear deal, addressing concerns about Iran's nuclear program and regional stability. (nytimes.com)</p>

          <p>A UNICEF report reveals that children in Japan continue to struggle with poor mental health, ranking the country 32nd among 43 developed and emerging nations, primarily due to high suicide rates among youth. Despite an improvement from 37th place in 2020, Japan's youth suicide rate is the fourth highest among wealthy states surveyed. In contrast, Japan ranked first in physical health and 12th in academic and social skills. The report emphasizes the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's academic performance and overall well-being, urging countries to address issues affecting children in the modern world.

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former Transportation Secretary under Joe Biden, suggested that Biden's decision to run for a second term in 2024 might have been a mistake. Speaking in Iowa, Buttigieg noted that with hindsight, most people would likely agree with this assessment, following Biden's poor debate performance and subsequent withdrawal from the race. He defended Biden's cognitive abilities during his time in office, citing their collaboration on the Baltimore bridge collapse as an example of Biden's competence. Buttigieg also encouraged Democrats to avoid returning to the status quo and to meet people where they are, hinting at a potential future presidential run in 2028. (cbsnews.com)</p>

Macron emphasized that any shared nuclear deterrence would not compromise France's own defense capabilities and that ultimate control over the weapons would remain with the French president. This proposal comes amid growing concerns among European leaders about relying on the U.S.'s nuclear commitment to Europe, especially given the perceived Russian threat.

          <p>China has completed key technology checks for an experimental satellite in very low Earth orbit (VLEO), marking an initial step towards building a 300-satellite constellation for high-resolution remote sensing and communications. The Chutian-001 satellite demonstrated core capabilities, including precise satellite control and real-time target detection. VLEO satellites offer advantages such as lower signal latency and stronger transmission, but must overcome challenges related to atmospheric drag. (scmp.com)</p>
