          <h2>China Reveals Electromagnetic Catapult System on Fujian Aircraft Carrier</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 10:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has released footage showcasing the electromagnetic catapult system of the Fujian, China's most advanced aircraft carrier. The footage provides a glimpse of an unidentified aircraft launching from the carrier deck. However, the report suggests that due to the complexity of the electromagnetic launch system, the Fujian will require more extensive sea trials compared to China's other carriers. The adoption of this system allows carrier-based aircraft to take off with full fuel and ordnance, and could soon facilitate the deployment of fixed-wing early warning aircraft and drones.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed a minimum 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military, aiming to streamline leadership and shift resources towards warfighters. The order also includes cuts to general officers in the National Guard and flag officers. Hegseth stated that the military must be unencumbered by unnecessary bureaucratic layers to foster innovation and operational excellence. The cuts are intended to optimize leadership by removing redundant force structure, although no specific timeline for implementation was provided.</p>

          <h2>Korean Women Divers Develop Genetic Adaptations for Deep Diving</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 09:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study reveals that the Haenyeo, women divers from Jeju Island in South Korea, have evolved unique genetic adaptations due to their generations-long cultural practice of deep diving. These adaptations include a slower heart rate and genetic mutations that provide cold tolerance and lower blood pressure. The lower blood pressure mutations are believed to protect pregnant divers from complications related to high blood pressure during deep dives. Researchers hope to expand this research to other diving cultures, which could lead to new medical therapies for conditions like stroke.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a bilateral trade agreement aimed at lowering tariffs on key exports, such as U.K. whisky and cars. This agreement comes amidst rising global trade tensions and tariff disputes initiated by the United States. The deal will gradually reduce taxes on imports from the U.K., with the majority of goods becoming tariff-free within a decade. Tariffs on U.K. exports like whisky and gin will be halved to 75%, while automotive tariffs will be sharply reduced from over 100% to 10%.</p>

          <p>Rebekah Vardy has been ordered to pay over ¬£1.4 million of Coleen Rooney's legal costs following their high-profile libel battle, dubbed the "Wagatha Christie" trial. The judge expressed hope that this would conclude the matter, which has involved extraordinary expenditure of costs by both parties. The case arose after Rooney accused Vardy of leaking private information to the press, leading to a lengthy and costly legal dispute. Neither party attended the remote hearing where the judge declared they "can both part to put this matter behind them".</p>

The deal aims to halve tariffs on gin and whisky to 75%, with further reductions planned, and to lower levies on cars, aerospace, and electrical goods.

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles. However, the company warned that potential U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively impact its profitability this year. Ferrari's CEO highlighted that the strong profitability was driven by product mix and continued demand for personalizations. The guidance for the year is subject to a potential 50 basis points reduction on profitability percentage margins due to the possible introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA.</p>
