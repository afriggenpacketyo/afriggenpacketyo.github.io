          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, affirmed the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's Universal Service Fund. This multi-billion-dollar program, supported by contributions from telecom carriers, aims to expand phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Kagan, rejected the challenge that the funding mechanism violated the Constitution, ensuring the continued operation of programs designed to bridge the digital divide.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes opened at record highs, driven by investor optimism regarding a potential U.S.-China trade agreement and expectations of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. This marks a significant turnaround from recent market volatility, which was fueled by concerns over tariff policies. Analysts note that a rebound in technology stocks has been a major contributor to the surge, though some caution that complacency about trade issues could still pose risks to the market's stability.

          <p>A trend dubbed "revenge saving" is emerging as Americans increase their savings in response to economic uncertainties like inflation, tariffs, and market volatility. The U.S. personal saving rate has risen significantly, with many consumers cutting discretionary spending to build up emergency funds and increase retirement contributions. This shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" reflects a broader consumer focus on financial stability, with experts noting the psychological and practical benefits of having substantial cash reserves.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has made concessions on its proposed welfare reforms after facing a significant rebellion from within his own Labour Party. The initial plan would have applied stricter criteria for receiving Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefits to all claimants. However, to avoid a defeat in Parliament, the government announced the new, tougher rules will now only apply to new claimants, a compromise that has satisfied some but not all of the dissenting MPs.</p>
