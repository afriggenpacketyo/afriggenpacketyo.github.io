          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Framework Emphasizes Attunement and Resilience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 09:24:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article introduces 'emotionally safe parenting,' a framework emphasizing emotional attunement and building resilience in children. It encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. The framework also stresses the importance of parents doing their own internal work to become less reactive and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. Practicing emotionally safe parenting involves reflecting on personal triggers, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame through healthy repair after conflicts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to diplomatic sources, a joint statement by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin omitted wording that could antagonize Japan. China reportedly requested the removal of references to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia" and investment in a special economic zone on disputed islands claimed by Japan, signaling an effort to stabilize relations with Japan amid tensions with the United States. The released document did urge Japan to learn from its past actions and distance itself from militarism, but the changes suggest a nuanced approach to regional diplomacy.</p>

Despite never reaching the final at the French Open, Sabalenka's performance justifies her status as one of the tournament favorites.

Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for a more dignified process. She worked with the local Western Union office to personally deliver telegrams and provide comfort to widows. Now, service members notify families in person and offer ongoing support, a testament to Moore's lasting impact and the sacred mission of providing solace to grieving families.</p>

Supporters view it as key to prosperity and enduring power, while critics decry it as a corporate infiltration. The agenda's focus on deregulation and streamlining government directly challenges the influence of activist organizations that have shaped progressive politics, promising moderate Democrats a positive identity beyond merely opposing progressive positions.</p>
