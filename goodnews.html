          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Wednesday following the release of weaker-than-expected job openings data. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell, while earlier in the day, it briefly surpassed 5% due to tariff uncertainty and concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. Investors are also anticipating Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show a slight increase in the unemployment rate and modest job creation. This article highlights the market's sensitivity to economic data and geopolitical factors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Topshop will be returning to the High Street in 2026, five years after it closed all of its UK stores, by partnering with John Lewis. The brand will be available in 32 John Lewis shops, while Topman will be available in six stores, with the new Topshop spring collection featuring 120 pieces curated by John Lewis. The partnership aims to bring new customers to John Lewis and re-establish Topshop's presence in physical retail, with potential for standalone stores in the future. This move signifies a comeback for the fashion retailer, which struggled during the pandemic and faced criticism for its sustainability record. </p>

          <p>An exhibition in Gdansk, Poland, titled "Our Boys," explores the controversial topic of Polish citizens who served in the Nazi Wehrmacht during World War II. The exhibition has faced opposition from right-wing conservatives who view it as a betrayal of Polish history, while curators aim to show the nuances and tragic circumstances faced by individuals forced into service. After Germany occupied Poland in 1939, many Poles were added to the German People's List, leading to compulsory military service, with refusal resulting in severe consequences for families. The exhibition sparks debate about historical memory and the complexities of wartime experiences. </p>

          <p>A New York judge has allowed critical DNA evidence to be used in the case against Rex Heuermann, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer. The defense had challenged the evidence, arguing that it was obtained using new DNA technology not previously used in a New York court. Prosecutors successfully argued that the technology was derived from accepted scientific methods. This ruling marks a significant development in the case, potentially strengthening the prosecution's argument. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can tap into their equity with home equity loans or HELOCs, which offer lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards. As of September 3, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.22% to 8.37%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. HELOCs provide a revolving line of credit with variable interest rates, while home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates. Both options may offer tax benefits for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations, but homeowners should shop around to find the best rates and terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion retailer Shein has launched an investigation after an image resembling Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering a CEO, was used to model a shirt on its website. The image, which has since been removed, prompted speculation about whether it was created using artificial intelligence. BBC Verify found a high similarity score between the image and a real picture of Mangione. This incident highlights the challenges faced by online retailers in monitoring content provided by third-party vendors, as Mangione's likeness has sparked controversy before. </p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupted again this week, spewing lava 500 feet into the air from its summit crater. The eruption, which lasted approximately 13 hours, produced a significant volume of molten rock contained within Hawaii Volcanoes National State Park. While the eruption itself caused no direct harm, the U.S. Geological Survey warned of high levels of volcanic gas and potential hazards from volcanic glass and fragments. The lava fountains released about 55,000 tons of sulfur dioxide, a toxic gas that can cause respiratory problems. </p>
