          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in negotiations to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, has seen his playing time diminish significantly over the past two seasons. A move to Everton would provide Grealish with an opportunity to secure regular first-team football and revitalize his career ahead of the World Cup. While an agreement is not yet finalized, the potential transfer represents a major signing for Everton as they prepare for their first season in a new stadium.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to nearly $120,000, approaching its all-time high, while Ether has climbed past the significant $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2021. This rally in the cryptocurrency market has been largely attributed to buying activity during Asian trading hours, potentially fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. Analysts suggest this trend acts as a tailwind for hard assets like Bitcoin and gold, positioning the market for further potential gains. The surge has also boosted the stock prices of related companies like Coinbase and various crypto miners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Advise Against Complex Investment Strategies, Advocating for Simplicity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Money psychology expert Morgan Housel argues that many intelligent investors mistakenly complicate their strategies, which often leads to poorer results over the long term. He, along with figures like Warren Buffett, recommends a simpler, more passive approach, such as consistently investing in low-cost index funds like the S&P 500. This "boring" method allows investors to harness average market returns over extended periods, a strategy that historically outperforms most active fund managers. The core principle is that achieving sustainable, long-term growth is more effective than chasing high-risk, short-term gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but market watchers anticipating a cut in September, savers are advised to lock in high interest rates on their cash now. Bankrate's chief financial analyst, Greg McBride, suggests that the window to secure rates above 4% is closing. The article outlines several options for short-term savings, including high-yield savings accounts, which offer liquidity but have variable rates, and certificates of deposit (CDs), which provide a fixed rate for a set term. U.S. Treasurys are also presented as a stable, tax-advantaged alternative for locking in current yields. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten years after China's surprising devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, its approach to exchange-rate management has matured. Analysts note that Beijing has moved away from depleting its massive foreign reserves to defend the currency, a tactic that cost nearly $1 trillion between 2014 and 2017. Instead, the country now employs a more diverse toolkit to manage volatility while allowing for more market-based pricing. This evolution has stabilized foreign reserves and poses new challenges regarding how to further internationalize the yuan without causing destabilizing fluctuations in the global economy.</p>
