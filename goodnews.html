        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have concluded that their case against former FBI Director James Comey for allegedly making false statements to Congress is likely untenable, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The central witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information anonymously and, in fact, advised against it on multiple occasions. This testimony undermines the core allegation that Comey lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous media sources. Internal memos suggest prosecutors recognized "insurmountable problems" with the case before a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney proceeded with the indictment.</p>

          <p>Verizon has entered into a definitive commercial agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide direct-to-cell phone satellite service, aiming to eliminate coverage gaps across the continental United States. The deal, announced Wednesday, will leverage Verizon's 850 MHz spectrum to offer connectivity in areas where traditional terrestrial networks are unavailable. This partnership expands on a previous collaboration and is set to begin next year, following successful tests of AST's space-based network. The announcement caused a significant surge in AST SpaceMobile's stock price, reflecting investor optimism about the new technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 08:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are emphasizing the benefits of qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) as a highly effective tax-saving strategy for retirees aged 70½ and older. This move allows for a direct, tax-free transfer of up to $108,000 in 2025 from a traditional IRA to an eligible charity. While not a deduction, the amount is excluded from the donor's adjusted gross income (AGI), which can help lower Medicare premiums and prevent phaseouts of other tax breaks. Additionally, QCDs can be used to satisfy annual required minimum distributions (RMDs), providing a way for philanthropic retirees to give to charity while managing their tax burden.

          <p>During a major trade delegation visit to India, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that his government will not relax visa regulations for Indian workers or students. The visit, aimed at boosting trade and investment following a recent agreement, involves over 100 British leaders from business and culture. Starmer emphasized that the focus is on leveraging the existing trade deal, which reduces tariffs on goods like UK cars and Indian textiles, rather than altering immigration policy. The stance aligns with the Labour government's broader goal of reducing overall immigration levels into the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>Germany has officially stated it will not agree to controversial EU plans for "chat controls," which would allow authorities to scan private, encrypted messages for illegal content. Justice Minister Stefanie Hubig called the proposal taboo in a democracy, solidifying the position of the EU's most populous member against the measure. Separately, the German cabinet has approved a legislative amendment that would permit federal police to shoot down threatening drones. This move aims to bolster domestic security capabilities, with further clarification expected on the role the military might play in assisting police with aerial threats.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is set to receive a significant gift of over 100 works of Austrian Expressionism from the family of renowned art dealer Otto Kallir. The donation will notably include the museum's first-ever paintings by celebrated artists Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. Kallir was instrumental in introducing Austrian Expressionism to the United States after fleeing the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938. This transformative gift solidifies LACMA's position as a leading center for Germanic modernism and fills a major gap in its collection, with an exhibition of selected works planned for November.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees overcame a five-run deficit to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6, staving off elimination in Game 3 of the AL Division Series. Aaron Judge was central to the victory, hitting a crucial three-run, game-tying home run and driving in four runs total. The comeback, the largest in an elimination game in franchise history, was aided by two costly errors from the Blue Jays. After a poor start from Carlos Rodón, the Yankees' bullpen shut down Toronto for the remainder of the game, securing the win and forcing a Game 4 in the best-of-five series.</p>

          <p>A trend known as "locking in" has gained popularity among Gen Z on social media, describing a period of intense focus on personal goals, often related to fitness, finance, or habit-building. The movement is seen as a reaction to the distractions of digital life and the economic anxieties facing the generation, including the rise of AI and a competitive job market. While it shares roots with millennial hustle culture, "locking in" is more focused on self-improvement than on climbing a corporate ladder. Critics note the performative aspect of the trend and question whether this constant drive for productivity leaves room for unstructured fun.</p>

The articles assert that the nation's economy is resilient enough to withstand both internal and external pressures, including trade protectionism and shrinking global demand. This messaging emphasizes the stability and predictability of China's long-term planning compared to what it describes as the shifting and self-isolating policies of some Western countries. The commentary aims to project confidence as Beijing prepares to outline its economic development strategy for the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a mathematics professor who was diagnosed with autism in their 30s reflects on their life experience and challenges the narrative that autism is a tragedy to be eliminated. The author argues that while social navigation was difficult, their autistic traits—such as persistence and a fascination with patterns—have also been sources of strength in their career. Drawing parallels to historical figures like Isaac Newton and the "deaf gain" movement, the article posits that neurodivergence contributes valuable perspectives to society. The author concludes that conversations about "curing" autism are debates about whether people like them should exist, asserting that difference is not a defect.</p>
