          <h2>Government Study Reveals High Levels of Loneliness Among Japanese Population</h2>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan indicates that approximately 39% of the population experiences feelings of loneliness, a figure that has remained consistent since 2021 despite the implementation of a law aimed at addressing isolation. The survey also explored the correlation between smartphone usage and loneliness, finding that individuals who spend more than eight hours a day on their devices are more likely to report feeling lonely. Bereavement of a family member was cited as the most frequent factor contributing to loneliness, followed by living alone and health issues.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams met with President Trump in Washington, D.C., ostensibly to discuss city priorities, including infrastructure needs, shortly before documents related to Adams' abandoned federal corruption case were released. Trump suggested Adams came to thank him, while Adams initially focused on a wind farm project. The released documents revealed an F.B.I. investigation into potential witness tampering by Adams. The meeting occurred amidst sensitive issues involving the city and the Trump administration, including investigations into NYPD actions and federal offices at Rikers Island.</p>

          <p>President Trump signaled openness to cutting tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a weekend meeting in Switzerland between top US and Chinese officials. The conciliatory tone comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators. Experts suggest the move is part of a negotiation process, with potential for further reductions to around 34%. The talks represent the first publicly announced meeting between the two nations since the trade war began.</p>

          <p>Elton John and Dua Lipa are among over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, which would require AI developers to be transparent about using copyrighted material to train AI models.

The government says they are consulting on measures that will work for both sectors.

          <p>California public health officials have issued an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and amnesic shellfish poisoning. The quarantine, effective through October 31, covers the entire California coastline and warns against consuming non-commercially harvested mussels. These toxins are produced by algae blooms, which shellfish consume, leading to the accumulation of biotoxins in their tissue. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt from the quarantine due to regular testing.</p>
