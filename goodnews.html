          <p>With home equity at significant levels, homeowners are considering borrowing against it, leading to a comparison between home equity loans and HELOCs. Currently, the repayment costs for a $100,000 home equity loan and a $100,000 HELOC are nearly identical. However, HELOC rates are variable and could decrease if interest rates are cut, offering potential savings. Borrowers should carefully weigh the pros and cons of each option, considering their financial needs and the potential for changing interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services raises questions about their role in financing convenience and lifestyle choices. BNPL companies allow consumers to break down payments into installments, but concerns arise about the risks of financing everyday purchases like food. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has taken steps to regulate BNPL companies, but recent changes may affect consumer protections. Some argue that BNPL is a solution to the rising costs of services like Uber and DoorDash, which were previously subsidized by tech companies.</p>
