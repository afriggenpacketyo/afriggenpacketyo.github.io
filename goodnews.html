          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City Police Commissioner during the 9/11 terror attacks and an ally of President Trump, has passed away at the age of 69. Kerik's career included serving in President George W. Bush's administration and founding a crisis management consulting firm. Despite his achievements, Kerik's legacy was tarnished by federal tax fraud and false statement charges, leading to imprisonment before being pardoned by President Trump. His death marks the end of a controversial figure who played a significant role in New York City's law enforcement and post-9/11 recovery.</p>

          <p>The White House has acknowledged problems in a federal government report led by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The report cited hundreds of studies, but some of these studies did not appear to exist, prompting the White House to announce an update to correct formatting issues. Despite these issues, the White House maintains confidence in Kennedy and describes the report as a transformative health assessment.

          <p>President Trump has launched an attack on conservative legal activist Leonard Leo, labeling him a 'bad person' who 'probably hates America.' This criticism follows a court panel's decision against Trump's tariffs, a ruling that put him at odds with some conservative legal theories. Trump expressed disappointment in the Federalist Society, suggesting they provided poor advice on judicial nominations and referred to Leo's work with the Teneo Network. The clash underscores the growing tensions between Trump and elements of the conservative legal movement, particularly concerning judicial appointments and legal doctrines.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to resume imports of seafood from Japan after a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement includes China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. This resumption marks a significant step in normalizing trade relations between the two countries following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.</p>

Musk's presence in the White House raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, and his work with DOGE led to cuts in international aid programs.
