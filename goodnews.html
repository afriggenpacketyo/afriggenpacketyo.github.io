          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris celebrated an emotional first victory at his home race, the British Grand Prix, after a chaotic, rain-affected event at Silverstone. The win was secured after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, who had been leading for most of the race, received a controversial 10-second penalty for an erratic maneuver behind the safety car. Piastri expressed confusion and frustration over the ruling, which was pivotal in the race's outcome. For Norris, the victory marks a significant career milestone, and he celebrated enthusiastically with his team, acknowledging the challenging conditions and the exceptional performance of both McLaren drivers throughout the difficult weekend.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton voiced significant frustration with his car's performance after finishing fourth in a challenging, wet-dry British Grand Prix. He described his Ferrari as the "most difficult car" he has ever driven in such variable conditions, highlighting its instability and lack of turning ability at low speeds. Hamilton emphasized the need for fundamental design changes for next year's car, stating that certain elements of the current model cannot be carried over. Despite the difficult race, which extended his podium drought since joining Ferrari, he noted that the experience provided valuable learning for the team as they look toward future upgrades.</p>

          <p>In an interview ahead of his new documentary, filmmaker Ken Burns describes the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the 'citizen.' He argues that understanding the nation's founding, with all its complexities and divisions, offers perspective on contemporary political polarization. Burns emphasizes that the founders, though flawed, created a system based on the 'pursuit of happiness,' which he defines as lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. He advocates for telling a complete and gritty history, believing that this approach strengthens, rather than diminishes, the nation's founding ideals and allows everyone to find a place in the American story.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina. While the system has weakened, it is still expected to bring heavy rain to the Carolinas through Monday, with forecasts of 2 to 4 inches and localized amounts up to 6 inches. This rainfall raises concerns about the potential for flash flooding as the system moves inland across central and eastern North Carolina. All tropical storm warnings have been canceled, and the system is expected to continue weakening as it moves northeast. Officials had earlier warned residents about the possibility of minor coastal flooding and isolated tornadoes.</p>

          <p>Two people were rescued from an SUV by courageous bystanders just moments before the vehicle exploded after crashing into a Domino's Pizza in Herriman, Utah. The crash ruptured a gas line, leading to a massive explosion that destroyed the restaurant and significantly damaged adjacent businesses. The driver and a passenger from the SUV were pulled to safety before the blast; they were among several people involved in a three-vehicle accident who were taken to the hospital. No one was inside the commercial building at the time of the crash, and no firefighters were injured by the subsequent explosion.</p>

          <p>During the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro, China and Brazil agreed to deepen their cooperation by establishing a joint research center focused on applying artificial intelligence to agriculture. The initiative aims to improve farming techniques in semi-arid regions, with an initial project focused on creating an AI laboratory to support family farming. This partnership between Brazil's National Semi-arid Institute and the China Agricultural University will explore connecting AI with common farm machinery to enhance environmental monitoring and soil quality. The agreement highlights the strengthening bilateral relations between the two nations and their shared commitment to leveraging technology for development.</p>
