          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 00:00:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed the 'Meteor-1,' the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which could accelerate AI and data centers. The chip has a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, comparable to advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development is significant as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and the US has imposed export controls on advanced semiconductors and AI chips to China. The article notes that optical computing offers advantages such as ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, low power, and minimal latency, positioning it as a critical future direction. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of further escalation in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both decreased, returning to levels below those preceding Israel's attack on Iran. The market's reaction suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions. The article also mentions that Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the avoidance of casualties, and called for peace. </p>

          <p>A severe heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures across the eastern United States, with over 150 million Americans under extreme heat alerts. The National Weather Service warns of significant risks due to light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling. Meteorologists attribute the heat wave to a heat dome, which traps heat and humidity. The article emphasizes the dangers of the first heat waves of the season and provides tips for staying safe, such as staying indoors, staying hydrated, and being aware of symptoms of overheating. </p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential ceasefire between Iran and Israel, suggesting that former President Trump's high-risk strikes may be paying off. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire that could lead to lasting peace. While Iran stated that attacks would halt if Israel stopped its aggression, it may not be called a ceasefire, but the two parties appear to be turning down the heat. The article notes that this development comes after a tumultuous day, with Iran retaliating for U.S. strikes and Trump warning of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks on U.S. interests. </p>

Hermer emphasized that complying with international law serves the national interest and that the UK is seen as a trustworthy partner on the world stage.

Judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction, preventing the administration from enforcing a proclamation that cited national security concerns. The judge's order was in response to Harvard's allegation that Trump was retaliating against it for refusing to accede to demands to control the school's governance, curriculum, and ideology. The university has filed lawsuits seeking to unfreeze funding and prevent the administration from blocking international students. </p>

          <p>Chongqing, China, is emerging as a global rail hub connecting Asean and Europe, facilitating faster and more reliable trade routes. The city has developed two expansive cross-border rail networks, one to Germany and the other to Singapore, enabling quicker access to global markets. Chongqing aims to become a central node in the global economy, serving as a rail-based 'Suez Canal' connecting Asia and Europe. This development highlights China's efforts to deepen its global trade footprint amid rising geopolitical risks and potential decoupling from the United States. </p>
