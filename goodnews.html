          <h2>China Focuses Research on Overlooked Southeast Asian Genetic Diversity</h2>

          <p>Chinese researchers are leading an effort to map the genetic diversity of Southeast Asian populations, which were largely overlooked by the Human Genome Project. The SEA3K data set, published in Nature, is the result of a decade-long collaboration with 34 Southeast Asian research teams and includes genome sequencing for 3,023 cases from six countries, five language families, and 30 ethnic languages. The study has already revealed unique genetic adaptations to tropical challenges and distinct Denisovan ancestry in the region, aiming to rectify the historical underrepresentation of mainland Southeast Asia in global genomic databases, where it previously contributed a mere 1.57 percent. This initiative underscores China's growing role in global scientific research and its commitment to documenting indigenous cultural and linguistic contexts while adhering to local ethical protocols. The effort involved extensive fieldwork in Southeast Asian rainforests to collect samples from diverse populations.</p>

          <p>A Chinese Harvard graduate's speech calling for unity in a divided world has sparked both praise and criticism in the United States and China. Jiang Yurong, the first Chinese woman to speak at a Harvard graduation ceremony, emphasized the value of international classrooms and a shared humanity, delivered her address shortly after the US vowed to "aggressively" revoke Chinese students' visas. Some conservative voices in the US have criticized Harvard for selecting Jiang, alleging her links to the Chinese Communist Party, while some Chinese social media users questioned her elite background. Despite the controversy, Jiang's message of unity resonated with many, with some expressing emotional support for her vision of a shared future.</p>

          <p>Despite an uncertain global economic outlook, the aviation industry is projected to improve in profitability in 2025, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Revenue, operating profits, and net profits are expected to increase from 2024, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. The industry's net profit margin is forecast to rise to 3.7% in 2025, with total revenues projected to reach a record high of $979 billion. Passenger load factors are expected to reach an all-time high, averaging 84% for the full year, although fleet expansion and modernization remain challenging due to supply chain issues in the aerospace sector. Jet fuel costs are anticipated to average $86 per barrel, translating into a $25 billion reduction in the total fuel bill compared to 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

Amber, a retriever cross rescued as a street puppy in Qatar, escaped from her foster family in the New Forest and is believed to have swam to the island before being rescued on her return. Despite regular sightings, Amber had entered a "wild mindset" until her rescue, and was eventually caught swimming back from Brownsea Island by two men in a boat. The charity that rescued Amber hopes she will have a calmer and more stable spirit in her forever home.</p>

The Mongolian-born 40-year-old, known as elder Miyagino, will leave the governing body amid uncertainty surrounding his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024, after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers, leading to the transfer of wrestlers and elders to the Isegahama stable. Hakuho, a winner of 45 elite-level championships and 1,187 matches, retired from competition in September 2021 and became a stablemaster the following July.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package to address the impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This marks the first large-scale attempt to address the impact of the atrocity, which devastated the Greenwood District, known as "Black Wall Street." The plan will involve raising private funds to support housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives for the descendants of the victims and the community. The reparations package aims to acknowledge the historical injustices and provide resources for the continued revitalization of the Greenwood District.</p>

          <p>Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. With all votes counted, Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the vote, compared to Trzaskowski's 49.1%, marking a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda, while supporting traditional Catholic and family values and Polish sovereignty within the EU. Although the president's role is largely ceremonial, Nawrocki's victory is likely to energize the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, giving them renewed hope for the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>
