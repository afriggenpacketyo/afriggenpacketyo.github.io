          <p>NHS England has announced plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate pressure on accident and emergency departments. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, offering immediate care from specialized staff in a calm environment. However, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism due to the lack of prior testing and called for improved funding for NHS mental health services, noting a decline in the share of health spending allocated to mental health treatment.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade agreement with the United States based on mutual respect, not threats, after President Donald Trump threatened to impose 50% tariffs on EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stated that the EU is ready to defend its interests, while European governments warned that higher tariffs would harm both sides. Trump expressed impatience with the ongoing trade negotiations, but suggested that a significant investment in the US by a European company might lead to a delay in implementing the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans for the government to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers, targeting a retail price of 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms to alleviate consumer burden from soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to be available in stores as early as June, as criticism mounts over the government's failure to curb the price spike. The government of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to begin procedures for negotiated contracts on Monday and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution of the lower-priced rice.</p>

Salesforce developed an AI agent to process changes in the U.S. customs system, while Kinaxis uses machine learning to assess products and materials.

According to a study, approximately 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum at their jobs, with those in their 20s being the most likely to adopt this approach. The primary motivation is having more "me time," as many young people saw their parents sacrificing their personal lives for their companies and have chosen a different path, leading to a shift in attitudes towards work.</p>

Despite the challenges, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez hitting a leadoff RBI double in the 13th inning to secure the victory.

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered his first military commencement address since returning to office, speaking to the graduating class at West Point. Trump's remarks followed a similar address at the University of Alabama earlier in the month, where he mixed traditional commencement advice with political attacks and false claims about the 2020 election. Vice President JD Vance also addressed the U.S. Naval Academy's graduating class, emphasizing Trump's commitment to deploying soldiers with clear goals, contrasting with past "undefined missions."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks suffered a frustrating 82-73 loss to the Golden State Valkyries, with their comeback attempt falling short despite a strong effort from Dearica Hamby, who scored 25 points. The Sparks struggled with inconsistency, particularly in the second quarter, which allowed the Valkyries to build a significant lead. Coach Lynne Roberts expressed disappointment, stating that the team needed to play with more intensity and cohesion for a full 40 minutes. Despite the loss, Roberts noted the toughness displayed by the Sparks in the fourth quarter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, said that the government plans to sell its stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming to make it available in stores at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms as soaring prices weigh on consumers. The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, with criticism mounting that the government has failed to curb a spike in rice prices, hurting households as inflation continues to outpace wage growth. Koizumi, who assumed his post on Wednesday after his predecessor resigned following a remark about gifts of rice from supporters, has pledged to sell the stockpiled grain directly to retailers, bypassing auctions that have prevented government control over prices.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday touted a "planned partnership" between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., saying it would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the world's biggest economy. A White House official said Trump's post on social media suggested he had approved Nippon Steel's plan to acquire U.S. Steel, despite Washington's concerns that the deal could heighten national security risks. Both steelmakers issued statements welcoming the reported decision, which came after a panel of federal agencies screened the buyout plan in a review that began last month at Trump's request.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's financial system is crucial for China to advance the internationalization of the yuan amid geopolitical tensions and discussions on de-dollarisation. Businesses in Qatar are keen to take advantage of the yuan by using a ‚Äútoolbox‚Äù available in Hong Kong, including settlement, payment, hedging and swaps. The trend showcases that the US‚Äô trade war has spilled over to the financial market, prompting more countries and businesses to consider alternatives to the dominant US dollar in international trades, payments and investments. This dovetails with China‚Äôs effort to internationalize its currency, a strategy that dates back to the 2008 financial crisis and aims to mitigate risks and assert financial independence amid escalating Sino-American decoupling.</p>

          <p>Military air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter as it neared the Pentagon on a flight that caused two commercial jets to abort their landings in early May at a Washington airport, the Army confirmed. The Pentagon tower lost contact with the Black Hawk helicopter for about 20 seconds as it was coming to land due to a temporary antenna being in a location that did not maintain contact with the helicopter as it was coming in to land at the Pentagon. The Army said its initial review "found no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic."</p>

          <p>Japan's supermarket operators have been strengthening sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice, offering another choice to consumers hit by rising prices and concerns about shortages of the country's staple food. Aeon Co. will start selling California-sourced rice on June 6 at its stores, mainly in urban areas, at 2,894 yen ($20) for 4 kilograms. Converted to the more common Japanese sales unit of 5 kilograms, it is 3,618 yen, some 15 percent cheaper than the average price calculated by the farm ministry of Japanese-grown rice at supermarkets nationwide in early May. This decision reflects consumer interest, with Aeon stating that consumers can no longer purchase rice as before due to higher prices.</p>
