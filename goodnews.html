          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP), led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, achieved a landslide victory in the recent general election, securing 87 out of 97 parliamentary seats. This marks Wong's first election as prime minister, with the PAP increasing its vote share to 65.57%. Wong expressed gratitude for the mandate, emphasizing its importance for stability and confidence in the government amid global economic uncertainties, and the U.S. State Department and EU Commission have already congratulated Wong on his victory, expressing their eagerness to strengthen ties with Singapore. The election took place against a backdrop of concerns about cost of living, jobs, and economic growth, with Singapore recently downgrading its GDP forecast.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates a significant shift in China's governance, with nearly half of the youngest cohort of bureau-level officials holding PhDs and possessing technical backgrounds. This trend marks a move towards technocratic meritocracy, reminiscent of the historical reverence for scholar-officials in Chinese society. The rise of technocrats, particularly those from elite institutions like Tsinghua University, signifies a system prioritizing competence over political patronage. This shift also reflects the relative stability offered by state-affiliated roles amid economic uncertainty, attracting highly educated individuals to public service.</p>

          <p>Residents in South Texas, largely SpaceX employees, overwhelmingly voted to formally incorporate Starbase as a city, fulfilling Elon Musk's long-held ambition. This move grants SpaceX greater control over the area, potentially streamlining launch operations by allowing the city to manage road closures and utilities. Critics, however, worry about Musk's expanded authority, particularly regarding access to a popular beach and state park. While SpaceX cites the need for community growth and efficient management, concerns remain about potential restrictions on public access and environmental impacts from increased launch activity.</p>

          <p>California Democrats are grappling with the question of whether their leaders are too old, sparking a debate about imposing a mandatory retirement age for state and local politicians. The discussion was prompted by concerns over leaders like Senator Dianne Feinstein, who served until her death at 90 despite health issues. While some argue that age limits are discriminatory, others believe they are necessary to ensure effective leadership and create opportunities for younger candidates, however there are no federal policies that require mandatory retirement for politicians.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's election as Prime Minister of Canada signals a potential shift in the country's approach to its relationship with the United States, particularly in light of President Trump's trade policies. Carney's campaign focused on challenging Trump's "betrayal" and defending Canada's sovereignty, and he secured a surprising victory after the Liberal Party gained significant ground in the polls following Trump's imposition of tariffs. His win is attributed to his ability to unite voters concerned about Trump's policies, including those from the left and even some Quebec separatists.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave," suggests that the process of selecting a new Pope shares similarities with the TV show "The Traitors," where contestants must identify hidden "traitors." Harris explains that the dynamic within a conclave, where a consensus suddenly forms around a particular candidate, mirrors the unpredictable nature of the show. Harris also argues that the process is a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right person to lead an organization. Harris also finds it strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>

          <p>The Reform party performed well in the recent local council elections in England, winning the most votes and seats, indicating a significant challenge to the established political order. The party's success is attributed to its appeal among Brexit voters and those who feel "left behind," highlighting the enduring political fault lines in Britain. The Reform party's success cannot simply be dismissed as a short-lived protest vote. The party did particularly well in wards that voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum than it did in wards that backed Remain.</p>

          <p>Michael McCarthy, the trainer of Journalism, the horse favored to win the Kentucky Derby, is drawing inspiration from his community in Altadena, California, which was recently affected by the Eaton Fire. The wildfire got within 600 feet of his home. McCarthy hopes that a win at Churchill Downs could provide some positive distraction for his community, which is still healing and recovering from the devastation. Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby. Journalism took second place.</p>
