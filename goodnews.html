          <p>Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil was released from ICE detention in Louisiana following a federal judge's order, who determined he wasn't a flight risk or community threat. Khalil, a green card holder detained for months, was accused by the Trump administration of posing a "foreign policy" concern due to his pro-Palestinian activism. The judge restricted Khalil's travel to New Jersey, New York, Michigan, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana for immigration proceedings. Khalil expressed relief at reuniting with his wife and son, while the White House and Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge's decision and vowed to appeal, citing national security concerns and allegations of omitted details on Khalil's green card application. The article highlights the conflicting views on Khalil's detention and the ongoing legal battle surrounding his immigration status. </p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a possible "deal" to resolve the conflict. The ruling prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. The administration had accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the attempt to revoke its student visa system certification. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the ruling, while Harvard vowed to defend its rights and those of its students and scholars. </p>

The recent clash, resulting in one Cambodian soldier's death, highlights deep-rooted border disputes in the Indochina peninsula.
