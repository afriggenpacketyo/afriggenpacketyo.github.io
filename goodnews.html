          <p>The Tall Ships Races have begun in Aberdeen, Scotland, an event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors and billed as Europe's largest free family festival. Dozens of impressive vessels from around the world, including from as far as Peru and Oman, are docked in the harbor for the four-day event. Despite a yellow weather warning for heavy rain, the festival kicked off with entertainment including a concert by the band Deacon Blue. Organizers hope to create a "party city" atmosphere, celebrating international friendship and providing sailing training for young people before the ships depart for Norway.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang conducted a charm offensive during his recent visit to China for the China International Supply Chain Expo, highlighting a recent thaw in US-Sino relations. His visit coincided with Washington's approval for Nvidia to export a less powerful, made-for-China AI chip, the H20, following a ban on more advanced models. Huang's optimistic presence was notable as US firms constituted the largest overseas contingent at the expo. The event took place after both nations agreed on a new framework in trade negotiations, suggesting a period of cautious but positive engagement on technology and trade issues.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Financial Comfort Is More Emotional Than Numerical</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans believe they need an average net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable, but financial experts argue this metric can be misleading. Certified financial planner Joy Slabaugh notes that people often fixate on achieving a specific number without considering their underlying values and lifestyle goals. Experts suggest that true financial comfort comes from aligning money management with personal values, such as freedom or security, rather than just tracking net worth. They advise focusing on cash flow and progress toward meaningful goals, as emotional well-being is a critical component of financial security.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Confirms No Scientific Evidence Links Sunscreen Use to Increased Cancer Risk</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite social media claims, there is no scientific evidence that using sunscreen increases the risk of skin cancer; in fact, it is a key tool for prevention. Health officials and researchers have debunked these claims, explaining that rising skin cancer rates are linked to other factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and climate change. While countries like Australia and the US have high rates of both sunscreen use and skin cancer, this correlation is not causal. Experts emphasize that many people use sunscreen improperly or inconsistently, and older studies on the topic used less effective products than what is available today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in the payment processing company Global Payments, whose stock has underperformed since its large, poorly-received acquisition of Worldpay. The market has shown skepticism about management's ability to integrate the new company and achieve projected synergies, leading to a depressed share price. Elliott's involvement is seen as a potential catalyst for change, possibly by reconstituting the board to enhance oversight, restore investor confidence, and improve execution on the merger. This strategic move aims to unlock value for shareholders by ensuring accountability for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial personality Dave Ramsey advised an entrepreneur concerned about potential new tariffs on Canadian goods to avoid panic and stick to his long-term business plan. Responding to President Trump's threat of a 35% tariff, Ramsey characterized the situation as "a lot of saber rattling" and "chaos over nothing," suggesting the actual net result is often minimal. He warned a Canadian log cabin kit manufacturer against fast-tracking a U.S. factory in reaction to political turbulence, arguing that a rushed, poorly executed move could be more costly than any potential tariff. Ramsey emphasized that smart, critical thinking should guide business decisions, not political headlines. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the Wallabies mounted a strong comeback in the final 30 minutes, capitalizing on the Lions' loss of discipline and accuracy to narrow the score. Despite the late-game struggle, the Lions held on for the win, though the performance left them with areas to improve upon before the next match.</p>

Remarkably, she had no visible skin mole, which is the typical sign of this deadly skin cancer. After undergoing an aggressive treatment combining targeted radiation and immunotherapy, she experienced severe side effects but has shown major improvement. Her doctors at the Cleveland Clinic call her a "Stage IV miracle," and her case highlights the importance of investigating any unusual lumps under the skin, as melanoma can sometimes present without the classic signs.</p>

          <p>Over the 25 years since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), Beijing has achieved what it calls "leapfrog development" in its relationship with the continent.

Alongside economic expansion, security cooperation has also deepened, with China now training approximately 2,000 African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent. This strategic partnership has allowed China to significantly increase its influence in Africa, often outpacing traditional powers like the U.S., Russia, and France.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced plans to dramatically scale back its Military Working Equid program, putting 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules up for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as in honor guards and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, and have not been used in combat since 1942. The move is expected to save the Army about $2 million annually from its $185 billion budget. While the program is being reduced, the Army will retain some animals for key ceremonial duties, ensuring the tradition of honoring fallen soldiers with horse-drawn caissons continues.</p>

This marks a major shift from the government's previously hands-off approach and is seen by supporters as a move to cement American dominance in financial technology.
