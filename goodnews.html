The airlines announced that some aspects of the partnership will begin as early as the fall, but did not provide exact timing or financial details. JetBlue's leaders have stated that they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines such as United and Delta Air Lines.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, promoting the Trump administration's efforts on stablecoin legislation and their potential benefits to the U.S. economy. Vance stated that the administration does not believe stablecoins threaten the integrity of the U.S. dollar, but rather sees them as a force multiplier of economic might. Republicans are attempting to pass the GENIUS Act, a bill that would regulate digital assets like stablecoins, which are designed to have a stable value against the U.S. dollar. The legislation has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, but faces challenges in the House.</p>

          <p>A federal court blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating he overstepped his authority when imposing them. The ruling, if it stands, would also strike down tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. Meanwhile, Trump has expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin regarding the slow progress in ending the war in Ukraine, though he's not ready to impose new sanctions. American and European conservatives are gathering in Hungary for the Conservative Political Action Conference, viewing Viktor Orban as an inspirational model. There are parallels between Trump and Orban in style and substance, including their handling of universities.</p>

While some cafes and restaurants may remain open, grocery stores in train stations and airports, as well as gas station convenience stores, will also be open.

          <p>Nvidia shares jumped after posting positive earnings, sparking a rally in global semiconductor stocks. Despite taking a hit from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory that it couldn't ship to China because of export curbs, also calculating $2.5 billion of lost revenue. The semiconductor industry has faced headwinds from uncertainty around tariff policy in the U.S. and chip export restrictions to China, but Nvidia's results have allayed fears that demand for its graphics processing units is dwindling.</p>

          <p>A deceptively simple reform, allowing single-stair construction for apartment buildings up to six stories, could unlock more housing options in the U.S. This approach, common in Europe and other parts of the world, could cut construction costs and allow for more varied unit layouts, including family-friendly three- and four-bedroom apartments. Despite resistance from fire safety officials, who prioritize double stairwells, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe. Several states are considering or have already adopted legislation to allow this type of construction, potentially easing the housing crunch.</p>

          <p>Stock market investors are finding a profitable strategy in trading around President Trump's tariff announcements and reversals, known as the "TACO trade." The pattern involves buying stocks after a tariff announcement causes a dip and then selling them after Trump inevitably reverses course, causing prices to rise again. This strategy is rooted in the understanding that Trump often makes tariff threats but rarely follows through, but it doesn't mean that the economy is back to normal after the tariffs have gone away, or that they are unimportant.
