          <p>The 2025 Kentucky Derby features Journalism as the morning-line favorite, trained by Michael McCarthy, who hopes to bring some joy to the Altadena community affected by wildfires. Sovereignty and Sandman are expected to be Journalism's closest competition. Mystik Dan won last year's Derby by a nose, and Brian Hernandez Jr., who rode Mystik Dan, will be riding Burnham Square in this year's Derby. Rodriguez was scratched due to a foot bruise, allowing Baeza to enter the race, and Bob Baffert returns to the Derby after a three-year suspension with his horse Citizen Bull. The article provides a list of the horses and their morning-line odds.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, a significant victory for his center-left Labor Party after trailing in polls due to cost-of-living concerns. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation projected Albanese's win shortly after polls closed, marking a defeat for the conservative opposition led by Peter Dutton. Dutton is also projected to lose his seat in Queensland, a conservative stronghold. The election took place amidst global uncertainty linked to the Trump administration, influencing Australian voters.</p>

          <p>Toby Keith's dream of having a horse compete in the Kentucky Derby will be realized with Render Judgment, a year after the country star's death. Keith started his racing operation in 2001, and Render Judgment's participation is a testament to his hard work and passion. Keith's horse trainer, Kenny McPeek, spoke about Keith's love for horse racing, saying that he may have loved it more than music.

          <p>An essay describes the experience of a widespread blackout in Spain and Portugal, where despite the lack of electricity, phones, and internet, citizens responded with kindness and community spirit. The author notes that instead of chaos or crime, people directed traffic, shared food and water, and gathered together in the streets. The author contrasts this response with the individualism promoted by the far-right, emphasizing the importance of trust and mutual support within a community. The author reflects on the strength found in joy and mutual support during adversity.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the complexities of antidepressant use, noting that while they can be transformative for some, others experience sexual side effects, manic episodes, or severe withdrawal symptoms. The article highlights the lack of high-quality research guiding clinicians on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, despite millions taking them long-term. The author notes that the medical community has reacted with alarm to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy‚Äôs claim that his family members have had a harder time getting off antidepressants than heroin.

          <p>Frances Lee, a professor at Princeton University, discusses the political failures during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting how decisions deviated from pre-existing pandemic plans. The debate was truncated, with measures like border closures and quarantines implemented without sufficient evidence. She argues that policymakers should have considered the trade-offs and costs of their decisions, including the impact on healthcare access and education. Lee emphasizes the need for acknowledging uncertainty, encouraging critical thinking, and avoiding moralized antagonism in future crises.</p>

The MP suggests that trials should take place to assess the impact of lifting these restrictions, drawing a comparison with other sports where alcohol consumption is permitted.

          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can survive and thrive in their native Mexico City wetlands. The study tracked 18 axolotls released into restored and artificial wetlands, discovering they gained weight and avoided predators. This success suggests that reintroducing captive-bred axolotls could help save the critically endangered species. Axolotls are popular in research due to their regenerative abilities, but their wild population is threatened by human interference and pollution.</p>
