          <p>Footwear giant Skechers has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm 3G Capital for $63 per share, marking the end of its nearly three-decade run as a public company. The acquisition price represents a 30% premium to Skechers' current valuation, a move occurring during a challenging period for the retail industry due to trade wars and discretionary spending concerns. Skechers' CEO, Robert Greenberg, will remain in his role, and 3G Capital believes in the long-term growth potential of Skechers, the world's third-largest footwear company.

The event, co-chaired by ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and Pharrell Williams, aims to center Black fashion in an institution that has historically excluded it.</p>

          <p>The Australian election results suggest that Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation no longer holds the power to sway voters, having consistently supported the Coalition without discernible impact since 2010. The decline of News Corporation's influence is part of a wider trend of waning influence for mainstream media, with audiences increasingly accessing news from diverse sources. The article suggests that the key to media success is reporting with objectivity and integrity, rather than relying on opinionated content.</p>
