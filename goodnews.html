          <p>Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns have launched a joint bid for the co-leadership of the Green Party of England and Wales, joining deputy leader Zack Polanski in the contest. Ramsay, who previously served as co-leader with Carla Denyer, is seeking re-election, while Denyer will not be standing. Chowns emphasized the need for leaders at the heart of national politics, while Ramsay highlighted the party's potential to hold the balance of power. Polanski has focused his campaign on building a mass movement to counter Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, as the Greens look to build on recent electoral gains. The party will vote in August and announce the results on September 2.</p>

          <p>In Serbia, a resilient student-led movement is challenging the increasingly autocratic rule of President Aleksandar Vucic, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The movement, sparked by corruption-related tragedies, has grown into the largest and most extensive protest in years, uniting diverse groups against the government. The government's attempts to quell the protests through resignations and financial incentives have failed, as evidenced by massive demonstrations in Belgrade. Protesters are employing innovative tactics like blocking the national broadcaster and organizing assemblies, demonstrating a commitment to solidarity and horizontal decision-making, setting an example for democratic movements worldwide. This New York Times article highlights the bravery and endurance of Serbian students as they push for early elections.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it will release Edan Alexander, an Israeli-American hostage, as part of efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement in Gaza ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The release is also intended to facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza, which has been under an Israeli blockade. Direct negotiations between Hamas and a US administration official are reportedly underway in Qatar. The Israeli PM's office has acknowledged the planned release but emphasized that preparations to intensify fighting are continuing, and the release was made possible by military pressure on Hamas, a development confirmed by President Trump on Truth Social. The release is seen as a goodwill gesture and a step towards resuming negotiations for all remaining hostages.</p>

Israel has stated that negotiations will continue despite preparations for intensified fighting, and that the release will not involve a ceasefire or the release of Palestinian prisoners, but will require a temporary halt to drone flights over Gaza. Alexander's family expressed gratitude and urged continued efforts to free the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen from a Japanese temple in 2012 and taken to South Korea, has been returned, resolving a dispute that strained bilateral relations. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the temple. The South Korean authorities arrested the thieves and confiscated it. Buseoksa Temple in South Korea filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago, but South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023.</p>

          <p>The UK government is implementing stricter migration rules, requiring spouses, siblings, parents, and adult children of foreign workers to pass an English language test. Care homes will also be restricted from recruiting staff from abroad. The move is seen as an attempt to address concerns about rising legal migration and counter the surge of Reform UK, which has gained traction by advocating for tighter immigration controls. The government also plans to prioritize residency rights for migrants who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, have high-skilled jobs, or volunteer in the community, with migrants now required to wait ten years to become British citizens.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reported progress in trade talks held in Switzerland, with both sides describing the discussions as productive and constructive. The US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were "in-depth" and "candid". The White House called it a "trade deal" but gave no further details. These were the first face-to-face meetings since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on Chinese imports, prompting retaliatory levies from Beijing. The talks have raised hopes of tariff reductions and a de-escalation of the trade war, which has caused turmoil in financial markets and sparked fears of a global recession.</p>

The goal is to ensure that military spending creates domestic jobs and revitalizes struggling towns, rather than concentrating benefits in wealthier areas.

          <p>Chris Mason of the BBC analyzes UK immigration trends, noting that net migration has been positive for the last 30 years, posing a significant political challenge. Despite efforts by successive governments to reduce net migration, the numbers have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the 2016 EU referendum. Brexit and the implementation of a new immigration policy in 2021 have not reversed the trend, with net migration figures remaining elevated. The Labour government aims to buck this 25-year trend of rising legal migration, seeking to address public concerns and fulfill promises of greater control over immigration.</p>
