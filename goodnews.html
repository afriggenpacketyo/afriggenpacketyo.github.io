          <p>Iran announced that the U.S. will return hundreds of Iranians detained for illegal entry, marking a rare instance of cooperation between the two countries. The deportations, involving individuals who crossed into the U.S. from Mexico, follow months of talks, with the first group scheduled to arrive in Iran via Qatar. The U.S. has previously deported Iranians, but this move represents a significant level of cooperation. It remains unclear what prompted the shift in American policy. </p>

          <p>Iran announced that 120 of its nationals are being deported from the U.S. as part of President Trump's immigration crackdown. These individuals, mostly those who entered the U.S. illegally, will be flown to Iran via Qatar. Some deportees held valid U.S. residency permits, with U.S. officials seeking their consent for return. This is considered the first phase of a deal expected to result in the deportation of around 400 Iranian nationals. </p>
