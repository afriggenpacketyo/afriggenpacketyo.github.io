          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that an extension of the current trade tariff deadline with China is probable. The current 90-day suspension of most heavy tariffs is set to expire, but Bessent expects to finalize an extension during upcoming talks in Stockholm. He described the trade relationship as being in a "very good place," expressing optimism for constructive dialogue on broader economic issues, such as China's manufacturing output and its purchases of sanctioned oil.

          <p>With inflation impacting retirement funds, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to access their home equity, but crucial questions must be addressed first.
