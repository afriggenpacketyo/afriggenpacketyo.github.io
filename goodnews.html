          <h2>UK Government Announces Plans to Reduce the Cost of Electric Vehicles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 08:29:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will introduce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. This initiative aims to encourage more drivers to switch from petrol and diesel cars ahead of the 2030 ban on their sale. Additionally, the government plans to invest £63 million in charging infrastructure, including funding for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" for homes without driveways. The specific details of the affordability measures are expected to be revealed later in the week.</p>

          <p>A shipwreck from 1880 has been accidentally discovered in the Fox River in Wisconsin by researchers conducting a sonar survey. The team from the Wisconsin Historical Society and the Wisconsin Underwater Archaeology Association was mapping other potential cultural sites when they found the 90-foot hull. The vessel is believed to be the L.W. Crane, a wooden paddle wheel steamer that caught fire and sank in 1880. This unexpected find highlights the potential for new archaeological discoveries, and further investigation of the site is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists in China has successfully developed a process to synthesize sucrose, or white sugar, from methanol, which can be derived from carbon dioxide. This biotransformation system uses enzymes and does not require growing traditional crops like sugar cane, potentially offering a new way to produce food while utilizing captured carbon. Published in the journal Science Bulletin, the research presents a promising strategy for addressing both environmental challenges and food security. The method can also be adapted to create other complex carbohydrates.</p>

          <p>The medical community is beginning to take the significant pain associated with IUD insertions more seriously, a shift driven by patient advocacy and updated clinical guidelines. For years, the discomfort of the procedure was often minimized, but new recommendations from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advise doctors to discuss and offer pain management options. These options can include topical anesthetics and nerve blocks, aiming to make the highly effective contraceptive method more tolerable for patients. This reflects a broader trend of addressing the historical minimization of women's pain in medicine.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering further regulations to protect children online, building on the existing Online Safety Act. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that new age-verification rules taking effect this month are a foundational step, but not the "end of the conversation." Technology Secretary Peter Kyle is reportedly looking into measures to address the "addictive habits" associated with social media apps, with proposals including usage caps and curfews under consideration. This comes as Ofcom, the media regulator, prepares to enforce the new codes of practice for internet companies.</p>

          <p>China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has announced the first successful extraction from a new uranium project in Inner Mongolia, which it describes as a "green, safe, intelligent and efficient" mining method. The project, located in the Ordos basin, reportedly avoids the need for tunnels and does not produce toxic waste, a significant advancement over traditional methods. This development could enhance China's competitiveness in the global natural uranium sector and support its expanding nuclear energy program. The new approach targets sandstone-type uranium deposits, which have been increasingly discovered in northern China.</p>

          <p>With the NFL committing to send players for flag football in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, questions are mounting as to why Major League Baseball (MLB) has not yet agreed to allow its stars to participate. While top players like Shohei Ohtani have expressed a desire to compete, MLB has remained noncommittal, citing logistical challenges and its own successful World Baseball Classic. LA28 officials and others argue that featuring the world's best baseball players would be a massive opportunity to grow the sport globally, but the league has yet to present a plan to make it happen.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing affordability and homelessness crises, California is creating a new cabinet-level state agency dedicated solely to these issues. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to provide a more focused approach. Supporters believe this will elevate the housing agenda to the highest level of state government and hope it is a first step toward simplifying the state's complex and fragmented affordable housing finance system. The new agency is set to officially launch on July 1, 2026.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech are creating "biohybrid" robots by embedding microelectric controllers into living jellyfish, allowing them to be remotely controlled for ocean monitoring. These cyborg jellyfish can be directed to swim and collect environmental data on temperature and pressure, offering a low-cost and scalable alternative to conventional underwater robots. Because jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. The research aims to make ocean data collection more accessible and could redefine how we study marine environments.</p>

The strike, set for late July, is part of an ongoing dispute over pay, with doctors arguing that a proposed 5.4% raise is insufficient to restore real-terms pay lost since 2008. The government has stated it cannot improve the offer, but the BMA expressed hope that constructive discussions could lead to a solution. Public support for the strikes has reportedly declined since last year.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York. The rock is estimated to sell for between $2 million and $4 million. It is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was discovered in 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade armed conflict with Turkey and has begun a disarmament process, creating a potential turning point for peace in the region. The PKK is demanding the release of its imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and amnesty for its fighters as part of a sustainable peace deal. While Turkey's government has called the move an opportunity, it remains cautious, waiting to see if the disarmament is genuine. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's relations with its neighbors and enhance its status in the Middle East.</p>
