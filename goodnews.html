        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been declared fit to resume playing on the second day of the third Test against India at Lord's. Stokes had experienced a right groin issue on the first day of the match, causing concern about his ability to continue batting and bowling. However, after bowling before play on Friday, he was cleared to rejoin his partner Joe Root at the crease. The news is a significant relief for the England team, which relies heavily on the all-rounder's contributions, though his deputy acknowledged the need to manage his workload carefully.</p>

          <p>Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, has voted to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, a process requiring a two-thirds majority. The conservative bloc's candidate, Günter Spinner, was elected, potentially with support from the far-right AfD party, while the Social Democrats' two nominees also secured their positions despite some controversy. In parallel, the upper house, the Bundesrat, is considering a significant corporate tax cut package aimed at boosting investment. This includes reducing the corporate tax rate from 15% to 10% by 2032 to stimulate the economy.</p>

          <p>For the first time in golf history, The Open at Portrush will feature a Spidercam suspended above the 18th green to provide unique aerial views of the championship's final moments. The R&A, the tournament's organizer, has installed the four-point wire-cam system to enhance the broadcast experience, capturing the champion's final walk with unprecedented detail. Despite initial concerns about potential player distraction, the innovation has reportedly been well-received by players and broadcasters like Sky Sports and NBC. The high-cost technology aims to create a more immersive viewing experience for millions of fans worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is celebrating its tenth anniversary by welcoming new leadership while continuing to navigate challenges, particularly from the United States. Established as a China-led alternative to Western-dominated financial institutions, the AIIB has focused on infrastructure development in Asia rather than poverty reduction. Its founding president, Jin Liqun, emphasized that the bank aims to work within the existing international order, not to overturn it. Despite ongoing skepticism from the West, the bank's membership has grown from 57 to 110 economies, indicating broad support for its mission across the developing world.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Halts Proposed Changes to Cash ISA Savings Allowance After Public Opposition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 04:28:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has decided to shelve immediate plans to reduce the tax-free savings allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) following significant backlash. Chancellor Rachel Reeves was reportedly considering lowering the £20,000 annual limit for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. However, strong opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer advocates has put the move on hold. While the government still aims to boost investment in the UK economy, it will explore other methods, such as educational programs, without altering the popular cash ISA rules for now.

          <p>England midfielder Jordan Henderson is set to return to the Premier League by signing with Brentford on a two-year contract. The move comes after the 35-year-old mutually agreed to terminate his contract with Dutch club Ajax one year early. Henderson, a former Liverpool captain, attracted interest from several top clubs but chose Brentford, which will provide him a platform to remain in consideration for England's World Cup squad. The deal is expected to be finalized in the coming days, marking his return to English football after a brief stint in Saudi Arabia and the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that the new "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement with France is robust enough to withstand legal challenges. The pilot scheme proposes that for every migrant the UK returns to France, it will accept one who has made a legal asylum claim there, with an initial exchange of about 50 people per week. Announced by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron, the plan aims to break the business model of people smugglers. Cooper expressed confidence in the deal's legal framework, contrasting it with the previous government's heavily challenged Rwanda deportation policy.</p>

          <p>This article examines the pros and cons of the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup. Critics point to an already overworked player base, profit-driven motives, and challenging playing conditions as significant downsides.

However, the competition has also delivered exciting moments, with underdog teams causing major upsets and fans from around the globe, particularly Brazil, creating a vibrant atmosphere. The piece questions whether skeptical English fans will eventually embrace the tournament or if it will be seen as one competition too many.</p>

          <p>Despite a broader sales slump across Europe, U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla is experiencing remarkable success in Norway. The company saw a 54% year-on-year increase in new car sales in June, largely driven by the popularity of its revamped Model Y SUV. This performance contrasts with significant sales drops in other major European markets like Germany. While CEO Elon Musk's political activities have sparked a backlash and a recent survey showed many Norwegians would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's value-for-money proposition and suitability for local needs continue to fuel its dominant market share in the country.

The force, known as the Multinational Force Ukraine, aims to help reconstitute Ukraine's military and secure its skies and seas after the war.
