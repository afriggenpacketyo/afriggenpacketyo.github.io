          <p>An advice columnist addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy and feels neglected. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication and personal boundaries, drawing on philosopher Erich Fromm's ideas about love and freedom. She advises the reader to clearly state her needs and ask her husband to reduce flirtation with his colleague while they work on their relationship. The article suggests that both partners engage in self-reflection and consider a gradual approach to non-monogamy if they choose to explore it, but ultimately, respecting individual needs is paramount. </p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, was forced to divert to Rome because the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was too large to land at the Naples airport. Passengers were then transported by bus from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours. The airline stated that the diversion was due to "operational limitations" and apologized for the disruption. Historical flight data indicates that American Airlines typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the Naples route.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is struggling to find skilled workers to build and maintain airplanes and engines, despite efforts to bolster manufacturing jobs in the United States. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic is 54, and the industry is projected to be short 25,000 technicians by 2028. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the issue, with companies cutting experienced workers. Airlines and manufacturers are now trying to attract younger people to the field, highlighting competitive wages and the opportunity to earn FAA licenses on the job.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the phenomenon of "anticipatory compliance" where institutions preemptively cater to the demands of a powerful leader, such as Donald Trump, even before being explicitly instructed. The author argues that this behavior paves the way for autocracy and advocates for "anticipatory noncompliance" as a counter-strategy. Examples of resistance are highlighted, including universities pushing back against government overreach, states challenging discriminatory policies, and consumers boycotting companies that scale back diversity programs. The author concludes that restoring democracy requires a multifaceted approach and unwavering opposition to authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>Despite a Supreme Court ruling against Mexico in its lawsuit against U.S. gun manufacturers, Mexico is continuing to pressure the U.S. to address the flow of firearms across the border. The lawsuit brought attention to the role of U.S.-made guns in Mexico's violence, and U.S. officials are now acknowledging a shared responsibility to stop southbound arms trafficking. Mexico is considering further legal action and is encouraged by the U.S. designation of Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>

          <h2>Viking Therapeutics Stock: A Volatile but Promising Biotech Investment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 05:55:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Viking Therapeutics, a mid-cap biotech company, have fallen by 34% this year, but the company's underlying thesis remains attractive. Viking Therapeutics is developing medicines across several areas with high unmet needs. The company's two most advanced programs, VK2735 (weight management) and VK2809 (MASH), have shown promising results in mid-stage studies. While the stock carries above-average risk due to its clinical-stage status, the potential upside makes it a worthwhile consideration for risk-tolerant investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government's upcoming Spending Review will include an ¬£86 billion package for the science and technology sector, aimed at funding research into drug treatments and longer-lasting batteries. The package also includes up to ¬£500 million for regions across the UK, allowing local leaders to direct funding to specific areas of expertise. Chancellor Rachel Reeves said investing in the sector would create jobs and boost security. However, research backers have cautioned that more needs to be done to secure the UK's reputation for science on the world stage.</p>
