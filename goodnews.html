          <p>The first group of critically ill and injured Palestinian children has been successfully evacuated from Gaza and is expected to arrive in the UK for NHS treatment, as confirmed by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. This significant government operation, coordinated by several departments, marks the initial phase of a broader effort to provide vital medical care. The move follows reports from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry of widespread deaths from starvation and malnutrition, alongside a health system stretched beyond breaking point by Israel's offensive. While Israel disputes some figures and says it's expanding aid, the article highlights the dire humanitarian situation prompting this international intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 682, which will phase out PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," from cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, and certain children's products. This move, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, is the latest effort to limit PFAS due to their persistence in the environment and links to serious health effects like cancer and organ damage. The article highlights a debate between environmental groups, who cite health risks from scratched or overheated nonstick pans, and the cookware industry, which argues that PTFE (Teflon) is safe when used correctly. The legislation aims to reduce toxins where PFAS-free alternatives already exist.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has developed a new generation of foundation models, exemplified by Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, that delivers strong performance while being significantly smaller and more cost-efficient than its predecessors. This technical innovation has allowed the model to perform ten times faster in some tasks and achieve a 90% reduction in training costs compared to the Qwen3-32B released in April. Industry experts like Emad Mostaque noted the model's impressive performance relative to its low estimated training cost of under US$500,000, starkly contrasting with the US$191 million estimated for Google's Gemini Ultra.

          <p>The article explores the growing issue of emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA), where children find attending school traumatic, as seen through the experience of a mother, Julie, whose autistic daughter Rosie developed severe anxiety and self-harm. Despite pressure from school staff regarding attendance, Julie now regrets pushing Rosie, who is now educated outside of school. School leaders report a "big increase" in EBSA, particularly post-Covid, with factors like sensory overload, social media, and mental health challenges contributing. The article highlights initiatives like specialized "school-within-a-school" units and a shift towards understanding underlying anxieties rather than viewing absences as truancy.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed a last-minute package of bills designed to stabilize the energy market by allowing 2,000 new oil wells annually in the San Joaquin Valley, while simultaneously tightening restrictions on offshore drilling. This deal, brokered by Governor Newsom and legislative leaders, aims to address affordability concerns, particularly gas prices, and the impending closure of two refineries. The article notes that while the inland oil expansion is a short-term measure to counter declining crude production, environmentalists and progressive Democrats criticize it as a "regulatory giveaway to Big Oil." The package also extends the cap-and-trade program and creates a pathway for a regional electricity market.</p>
