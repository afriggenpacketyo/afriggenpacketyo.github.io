          <p>Germany is currently engaged in a heated debate among politicians regarding calls to ban the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party. Simultaneously, rail services between Cologne and Berlin are experiencing disruptions due to planned upgrades at Cologne railway station, with high-speed trains canceled for two weeks. Deutsche Bahn, the network operator, is installing a new electronic signal box, impacting several regional and suburban lines but not affecting services connecting Hamburg, Bremen, and Cologne. Cologne Central Station, a major European transport hub, serves approximately 180,000 passengers daily and this disruption will impact travel to other European nations.</p>

          <p>A Japanese minister announced that all tariffs are under review for the Japan-U.S. tariff deal. This announcement signals a potential shift in trade relations between the two countries, possibly leading to adjustments in existing agreements.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The trial involved 800 participants across 37 countries who received weekly injections of semaglutide or a placebo between 2021 and 2023. After 72 weeks, 62.9% of the semaglutide group experienced reduced inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, while 36.8% saw improvements in liver fibrosis, suggesting semaglutide could be an effective tool in treating advanced liver disease. Adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in the Amazon after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot managed to land the craft near the Itanomas River, and the survivors stood on top of the plane surrounded by alligators. They were eventually rescued by local fishermen and transported to a hospital. The pilot believes petrol leaking from the plane kept the predators at bay, and the survivors sustained themselves by eating cassava flour brought by one of the passengers.</p>

          <p>A new impact assessment suggests that assisted dying cases in England and Wales could surpass 4,000 annually within 10 years of legalization, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The report, designed to inform MPs debating the issue, estimates initial NHS savings from reduced care costs but also anticipates significant expenses for staffing and training. While proponents emphasize the compassionate aspect of providing choice at the end of life, opponents raise concerns about potential risks to vulnerable individuals. The bill returns to the House of Commons later this month for a crucial vote.</p>

          <p>Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major electoral test as the country votes amid concerns over rising living costs and potential impacts from the U.S.-China trade war. The People's Action Party (PAP), which has ruled since 1965, is expected to retain power but faces a challenge from a rejuvenated opposition. The election is seen as a bellwether for Wong's leadership and the enduring dominance of the PAP. The vote is compulsory, and results are expected early Sunday.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species. The new antivenom cocktail, tested on mice, showed unprecedented breadth of protection, covering many elapid snakes for which no current antivenom exists. This research offers hope for a universal antivenom that could save lives and prevent disabilities caused by snakebites.</p>
