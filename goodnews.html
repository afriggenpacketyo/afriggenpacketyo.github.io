          <p>Following the conclusion of the Glastonbury Festival, a major clean-up operation has commenced at the Worthy Farm site in Somerset as thousands of attendees depart. Volunteers are clearing the area of discarded items, with organizers urging festival-goers to take all their belongings with them. The mass departure has caused significant traffic delays, compounded by an amber heat health alert with temperatures expected to reach 31¬∞C. The site will undergo extensive preparation for a fallow year in 2026, allowing the land to recover.</p>

          <p>Moderna announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results are a crucial step for the company, paving the way for regulatory submissions for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination COVID-19 and flu shot. The company had previously withdrawn its application for the combination vaccine but plans to resubmit it with this new efficacy data. Moderna anticipates potential approvals for both products next year, positioning itself as a frontrunner in the market.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, explains that understanding a dog's experience of the world begins with its nose. In an interview, she details how smell is a dog's primary sense, shaping their perception of space and even time. Horowitz describes her own experiments, such as sniffing objects at a dog's height, to better grasp this olfactory reality. She suggests that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are rich sources of information, allowing them to perceive the lingering presence of people and events long after they are gone.</p>

          <p>The second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Barry, has dissipated after making landfall on Mexico's east coast as a tropical depression. The system, which briefly reached tropical storm strength, is expected to bring heavy rainfall to the regions of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas. The National Hurricane Center had issued a tropical storm warning, forecasting several inches of rain as the system moved inland. Forecasters noted that while the storm weakened upon hitting the coast, it still brought tropical storm conditions to the area.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a specific protein, according to a new study. The research, published in Nature Aging, provides a detailed analysis of the cellular and molecular aging patterns in the primate cochlea. The study also found that the common diabetes medication metformin could slow the progression of this hearing loss in monkeys.

          <p>China's entertainment industry is adopting artificial intelligence with fewer reservations than Hollywood, where concerns over labor and intellectual property have created a more fraught relationship with the technology. A Chinese government-backed foundation has announced a project to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, planning to create new animated versions and immersive experiences. This contrasts with the U.S., where guilds like the DGA strongly oppose altering a director's original work.

The ban, which took effect Sunday, is aimed at protecting children from exposure to smoke and the influence of smokers. Violators of the new restrictions can face fines starting at around $150. While the move is supported by a majority of the French public, some smokers feel the law is excessive for outdoor spaces, though it does not currently apply to e-cigarettes or outdoor caf√© seating.</p>
