          <h2>Americans' Alcohol Consumption Reaches Record Low, Gallup Poll Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a notable decrease since 1939. This decline is primarily driven by increasing public awareness regarding alcohol's health risks, as scientific consensus now suggests that any amount of consumption can have negative effects. Younger generations, particularly those aged 18-34, are more inclined to perceive moderate drinking as harmful, influencing this societal shift. The article also highlights a significant gender disparity in alcohol use and preferences. This trend is further supported by the growing popularity of no-drinking challenges and non-alcoholic beverage options.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the franchise at a record $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise, with Chisholm's group initially acquiring at least 51% ownership and planning to buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and co-founder of STG Partners, is set to assume the role of Celtics' governor. The transaction is expected to finalize shortly, ushering in a new era for the team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study reveals that pet dogs can be highly effective in detecting the hard-to-find egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly, a destructive pest threatening various plants. Utilizing their superior sense of smell, trained dogs achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in real-world outdoor environments, surpassing human detection rates. This innovative approach offers a promising solution to combat the rapid spread of the lanternfly, which has already infested 19 U.S. states since its 2013 detection in Pennsylvania. Researchers hope this study encourages more widespread training of dogs for environmental protection against invasive species.</p>

          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have finalized a ten-year, A$500 million ($328 million) security and business agreement, known as the Nakamal agreement, aimed at deepening bilateral ties. This deal is part of Australia's broader strategy to enhance its influence in the Pacific and counterbalance China's growing presence in the region. The agreement will fund two major data centers, support climate change initiatives for the low-lying island nation, and bolster Vanuatu's security infrastructure. While visa-free travel was discussed, it will be addressed in a separate, subsidiary agreement, marking a significant long-term commitment between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Viral "Zombie Rabbits" with Horn-like Growths Explained by Scientists</h2>

          <p>Viral photos circulating online depict rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths, leading to descriptions like "zombie-rabbits." These growths are real and are caused by the Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease primarily found in the American Midwest. Spread by fleas and ticks, the papillomas typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems combat the virus. While alarming in appearance, the condition does not usually harm wild bunnies unless it obstructs eating or vision. This natural phenomenon is even believed to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the "jackalope."</p>

          <p>A survey indicates that over half of business travelers, particularly C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones on their work trips, a practice often referred to as "bleisure" travel. This trend is driven by desires for companionship, reclaiming family time, and significant cost savings by leveraging company-covered expenses for part of the trip. While generally accepted by companies as long as work objectives are met and expenses are separated, many employees still quietly manage these arrangements. The blended travel market is projected to reach $731 billion globally by 2032, highlighting its growing popularity.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Infowars, including its brand name and studio equipment, to be turned over to a newly-appointed receiver. This significant development paves the way for the sale of these assets to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to the families of Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. Alex Jones, who spread false conspiracies about the tragedy, faces the potential end of his Infowars platform. Legal experts suggest this state court action may expedite payouts to the families and could facilitate a sale to the satirical site The Onion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the British Medical Journal indicates that drug treatment for individuals newly diagnosed with ADHD may offer wider life benefits beyond managing core symptoms. The research, involving 148,500 people in Sweden, found that ADHD medication was linked to significant reductions in first-time instances of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These benefits are attributed to the medication's ability to reduce impulsive actions and improve concentration. The findings provide crucial evidence for patients considering medication, highlighting its potential positive impact on long-term behavioral outcomes and public health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's policies aimed at curbing China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry are prompting South Korean shipbuilders to strategically invest in ASEAN countries, such as the Philippines. This move is intended to mitigate domestic challenges like limited capacity and labor shortages in South Korea. HD Hyundai, for instance, plans to invest $550 million to revive a shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. While this shift leverages lower labor costs, analysts caution that developing the necessary technical skills among new workforces will require time. (not investment advice)</p>
