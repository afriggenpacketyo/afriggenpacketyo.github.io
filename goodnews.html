          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly evaluating a potential acquisition of some of BP's assets, particularly its liquefied natural gas (LNG) holdings, fueling speculation about a possible takeover of the energy major. ADNOC's interest comes amid a period of underperformance by BP, making it an attractive target for larger industry players like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. While a full takeover by ADNOC is considered unlikely due to its primary focus on gas assets, the two companies have a history of collaboration across various geographies and energy sectors. BP is currently undertaking a strategic reset to restore investor confidence, including increasing oil and gas spending while reducing investments in renewables, aiming for $20 billion in divestments through 2027.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is advocating for France to manufacture advanced chips, positioning the country as a key tech hub in Europe, as European nations reassess their reliance on foreign tech firms. Macron highlighted that Nvidia's first GPU was made in France, underscoring the country's historical involvement in chipmaking. He expressed his ambition for France to produce semiconductors in the 2-nanometer to 10-nanometer range, requiring partnerships with companies like TSMC or Samsung to build local factories. Macron also touted a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Taiwan's Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a warning that several Jolly Rancher sweets are unsafe to eat due to the presence of chemical compounds, mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) and mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH), that do not comply with UK laws. MOAH can cause DNA damage and potentially increase the risk of cancer if consumed regularly over time, although the immediate food safety risk is considered low. The affected products include Jolly Rancher Hard Candy, Jolly Rancher 'Misfits' Gummies, Jolly Rancher Hard Candy Fruity 2 in 1, and Jolly Ranchers Berry Gummies. The FSA advises consumers to dispose of these products and urges businesses to remove them from the market, as The Hershey Company has been working to remove the affected Jolly Rancher products from the UK market since 2024.</p>

          <p>China has stated that its military activities are in full compliance with international law. The statement comes amid increasing scrutiny and concerns from other nations regarding China's military actions in the region, particularly in the South China Sea and near Taiwan. The assertion of compliance with international law serves as a defense against accusations of aggression or violations of established maritime and aerial regulations. China's increased military presence and exercises have heightened tensions with neighboring countries and prompted calls for transparency and adherence to international norms.</p>

          <p>Viktor Gyokeres, once a Brighton player who never played a minute of Premier League football, has become one of Europe's most sought-after transfer targets after outstanding seasons with Sporting, where he played under United boss Ruben Amorim. Gyokeres has scored 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting, contributing 26 assists, with 54 goals in 52 appearances in the past season. Despite his prolific form, doubts remain about Gyokeres' ability to replicate his success in the Premier League, with some questioning whether he can maintain his performance against physically matched opponents. Several top clubs, including Arsenal, Juventus, and Al-Hilal, are reportedly interested in acquiring the Swedish forward.</p>

          <p>China is making strides in the mass production of high-performance photonic chips, positioning the country for significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light instead of electrical signals for data transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in the field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance by overcoming a global limit for high-speed optical links. TFLN is known for its ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption, making it a promising material for future technological advancements.</p>

Frankie O'Reilly, who lost his partner Georgie to an Aids-related illness, participated in the project as a way to cope with his grief and honor his friend.
