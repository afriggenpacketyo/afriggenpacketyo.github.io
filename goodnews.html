        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced housing market reform plans aimed at reducing costs, delays, and failed sales. Housing Secretary Steve Reed stated that the changes would "fix the broken system" and save money for working people. First-time buyers could save an average of £710, and property transaction timelines could be reduced by up to four weeks. The proposals include legally requiring sellers and estate agents to provide key property information upfront, such as home condition, leasehold costs, and property chain details. Binding contracts may also be introduced to prevent parties from walking away late in the deal, halving the number of failed transactions. A new mandatory Code of Practice for estate agents and conveyancers is being proposed to boost professional standards across the housing sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article discusses China's need to shift its economic strategy from export dominance to becoming the world's largest importer. The author argues that this transition would mark a pivotal evolution in China's economic strategy and carry significant geopolitical and economic implications. The upcoming 15th five-year plan is critical for China to accelerate its transition to a consumption-driven economy and address structural imbalances. This shift would require prioritizing domestic demand over investment and exports, fostering a more balanced and sustainable economic model. Embracing this new era would signify a move from 'made in China' to 'consumed in China.'</p>

Lipa's tour emphasizes musicianship and long-term durability, with a sprawling live band and moments of vocal candor. Despite 'Radical Optimism' not producing era-defining singles, the tour sold out four nights in Los Angeles, proving Lipa's ability to connect with fans through live performances and personal interactions.</p>

          <p>Several Indiana Republicans, including Governor Mike Braun and Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith, criticized Indianapolis leaders for violence following the stabbing of Mark Sanchez, before Sanchez was charged in the incident. Braun and Beckwith deleted their tweets calling for state intervention, but Indianapolis Councilor Michael-Paul Hart's post remained. Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears responded to Braun, accusing him of exploiting violence for political gain. Sanchez was arrested on misdemeanor charges after an altercation with a 69-year-old man who stabbed him in self-defense, according to court documents. Violent crime statistics show a decrease in homicides this summer compared to last year.</p>

          <p>Three experienced cavers were rescued after being trapped for over 30 hours in Dowber Gill Passage, North Yorkshire, during Storm Amy. The alarm was raised when they failed to return, prompting a rescue operation involving over 100 volunteers from various caving teams. Worsening weather, flooding, and challenging terrain hampered the rescue efforts, with rising water levels making the simplest exit route impassable. The cavers were eventually guided to safety, exhausted but unharmed, after enduring cold and wet conditions. The successful rescue was attributed to the cavers sharing their route details beforehand.</p>

The sketch explored the phenomenon of being both inside and outside a cultural moment, with Bad Bunny playing a character obsessed with the children’s movie.

          <p>A federal judge in Oregon issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from sending the National Guard to Portland, deeming the move unjustified. Judge Karin Immergut stated the protests did not warrant federal intervention and allowing the deployment could harm Oregon's sovereignty. Oregon officials celebrated the ruling, calling it a check on presidential power. The White House indicated an appeal was likely, while California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the Trump administration for sending California National Guard troops to Oregon.</p>

          <p>The Conservative party is invoking Margaret Thatcher's legacy at their annual conference, celebrating 100 years since her birth. With the party facing poor poll numbers, activists are looking to Thatcher's leadership for inspiration. Leader Kemi Badenoch is reportedly drawing from Thatcher's early years in power. The party is debating whether Thatcherite policies hold lessons for Badenoch as she attempts to revive the Tories' fortunes, with some suggesting a focus on reining in government bodies and promoting enterprise. The economy is seen as a key area for the Conservatives to regain public trust.</p>
