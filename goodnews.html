          <p>Eli Lilly announced plans to acquire gene-editing firm Verve Therapeutics for up to $1.3 billion, marking its third small deal of the year as it looks to diversify its pipeline. This move follows Lilly's earlier acquisitions of SiteOne Therapeutics and an experimental breast cancer drug from Scorpion Therapeutics. Verve Therapeutics focuses on cardiovascular disease treatment, particularly Verve-102, which aims to reduce "bad" cholesterol by targeting a gene in the liver. The acquisition reflects Lilly's commitment to long-term growth through strategic acquisitions that complement its existing research and development efforts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that at least 3% of measles cases this year have occurred in people who were fully vaccinated with two doses of the measles vaccine. These cases, primarily in Texas and Colorado, highlight the importance of maintaining vigilance and understanding the effectiveness of vaccines over time. Health authorities are urging some seniors to consider a measles booster, especially if they plan to travel, due to the potential for less effective vaccines used before 1968. The CDC emphasizes that measles vaccines are highly effective, with 97% protection after two doses, but breakthrough cases can still occur.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry believes that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) could potentially replace chemotherapy for some cancer patients. ADCs deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are developing ADCs, investing billions in the process. While challenges remain, some companies claim ADCs have shown the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings, and others are inching closer to developing ADCs that can be used before chemo.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, Captain Cook's HMS Endeavour has been confirmed to be in waters off Rhode Island. Two historians originally pinpointed the location of the ship in 1998, and a 26-year archival and archaeological research program ultimately confirmed that the Endeavour was at the bottom of Newport Harbor. After Cook's death, the ship was used for transporting British troops and detaining prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in 1778.</p>
