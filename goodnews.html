          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased 22% to $3.72 billion, with revenue climbing 15% to $14.58 billion. The equities trading division was a standout performer, generating $4.3 billion in revenue, a 36% jump from the previous year and well above analyst forecasts. The strong results reflect a favorable market environment for trading desks, spurred by market volatility, and a rebound in investment banking activity.</p>

          <p>Bank of America posted mixed financial results for the second quarter, beating profit estimates but falling short on revenue. The company's profit grew approximately 3% to $7.12 billion, while its revenue of $26.61 billion was slightly below analysts' expectations. A key factor was its net interest income (NII), which missed estimates by $70 million, as loan and deposit growth were counteracted by lower interest rates compared to the prior year. Despite the revenue miss, CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted the resilience of consumers and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang conducted a high-profile visit to China, signaling a potential thaw in tech tensions as the company expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to the country. The visit, Huang's third in six months, included meetings with Chinese officials and tech leaders like Xiaomi's CEO. Huang expressed hope that the resumption of H20 chip sales is part of a broader deal between the U.S. and China. He also acknowledged the formidable capabilities of Chinese competitor Huawei, stating that anyone who discounts their chip design and manufacturing ability is "deeply naïve."</p>

          <p>In a notable shift in tone, a leading Chinese state-run newspaper, the Economic Daily, has published an editorial supporting the country's major internet platform operators. The article emphasized that innovations improving daily life, such as food delivery, are as crucial to the nation as "hard-tech" breakthroughs in areas like aerospace and chip manufacturing. This friendly rhetoric reflects Beijing's recent moves to ease its regulatory crackdown on the tech sector. The editorial states that China needs both types of innovation to advance, signaling a more balanced approach after years of intense scrutiny on consumer-facing tech giants.</p>

          <p>Wang Huning, China's fourth-ranked official, has emphasized that boosting domestic demand is a strategic priority for the country's long-term economic health. Speaking at a political advisory meeting, Wang called for more practical research and effective policy proposals to be translated into "actionable results." His comments come as China's leadership prepares for a key Politburo meeting at the end of the month. Analysts anticipate further stimulus policies aimed at lifting weak domestic consumption, which has been a persistent challenge for the nation's post-pandemic economic recovery.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight Tyson Fury will not fight in 2025 but is aiming for a rematch against Oleksandr Usyk next year, according to his promoter Frank Warren. Fury, who announced his retirement in January after two losses to Usyk, has recently hinted at a return to the ring. Warren confirmed that while Fury is currently in the gym for his physical and mental well-being, he has made it clear he wants another bout with the Ukrainian champion. This follows Fury's recent social media post suggesting a trilogy fight at Wembley Stadium in April.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin and Ether, rebounded on renewed optimism that key U.S. legislation for the crypto industry could advance in the House of Representatives this week. The market had briefly dipped after a procedural snag delayed two bills, including the GENUIS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins. However, President Trump indicated that several Republicans who had blocked the bills have now changed their position following a White House meeting. Analysts suggest the passage of these regulatory bills is a matter of 'when,' not 'if,' which could bring much-needed clarity and stability to the digital asset market.</p>

The wealth management segment also delivered robust results, with net revenues of $7.76 billion, up from $6.79 billion a year ago.

          <p>For the first time in its history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off after the American and National Leagues were tied 6-6. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber became the hero for the National League, hitting three home runs on three swings to overcome a deficit and secure the victory. The new tiebreaker rule, implemented in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, provided a dramatic conclusion to the game. The exciting finish has sparked discussion about whether the format could be used in other contexts, such as regular season games.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume direct flights after determining that Pakistan has made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was first imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which emerged after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. The decision follows a similar move by the European Union earlier this year and is expected to provide a major boost to PIA. The national carrier estimates the suspension cost it approximately $144 million in annual revenue.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Africa as a testing ground for the global rollout of its currency, the yuan. During a recent visit to Egypt, Chinese and Egyptian central banks signed agreements to promote the yuan in trade and investment, including expanding China's UnionPay services and facilitating cross-border payments through CIPS, China's alternative to the SWIFT network. Egypt is the latest African nation to establish yuan-based deals with China, joining countries like South Africa and Nigeria. This strategic push is a key part of Beijing's long-term goal to increase the yuan's international influence and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>While the first-ever home run swing-off provided a thrilling end to the MLB All-Star Game, this article argues that baseball cannot rely on a tie score every year to generate excitement. The author suggests further innovations are needed to revitalize the event, such as a judged bat-flip competition during the Home Run Derby to create viral social media moments. The piece also criticizes the high number of star players, particularly pitchers, who withdraw from the game. It proposes logistical changes, like moving the game to a Wednesday, to encourage more of the sport's best players to participate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury group Richemont, owner of Cartier, reported a 6% rise in quarterly sales, slightly beating analyst forecasts. However, the results were weighed down by a 15% sales decline in Japan, where a currency-fueled spending boom by tourists has abated. A recent strengthening of the Japanese yen has reduced the purchasing power of international visitors, particularly from China, who had flocked to the country for luxury bargains. Despite the slowdown in Japan, Richemont's high-end jewelry brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels continued to show strong growth, helping the company outperform a wider luxury market downturn.</p>
