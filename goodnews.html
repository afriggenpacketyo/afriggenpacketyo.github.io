          <p>Marking the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, this article reflects on the lessons it offers for modern California. The quake exposed the deadly vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a problem that persisted for decades and still exists in some areas. While the event prompted Santa Barbara to adopt new building codes and its signature Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, experts note that many modern buildings remain at risk, highlighting a continued reluctance to mandate necessary seismic retrofits.</p>

          <p>The Gen Z slang term "crashing out" has become popular online to describe a range of behaviors from emotional outbursts to angry confrontations. This article examines the trend, seen with public figures like Justin Bieber and on platforms like TikTok, where users document themselves having meltdowns. While some view it as a necessary form of catharsis for a stressed generation, mental health professionals express concern that it may normalize emotional dysregulation and discourage the development of healthier coping mechanisms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprisingly cautious reactions from China and Russia following the recent US and Israeli strikes on Iran reveal the practical limits of their anti-American alliance. Despite shared antagonism toward the West, both Beijing and Moscow prioritized their own economic and diplomatic interests over providing significant support to their partner. This suggests that when global stability is at risk, the bonds of this axis are weaker than often portrayed, and that China is unlikely to jeopardize its relationship with the West for its allies.</p>

The issue of player heritage has been a talking point on the tour, but Lowe and his teammates brushed off the announcer's gag. They responded on the field with a dominant 54-7 victory, with Lowe stating the team can keep the joke going if the results stay the same.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former middleweight world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous points decision in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared unmotivated and threw very few punches for most of the contest. While Paul showcased improved skills, the victory raises familiar questions about the quality of his opponents, given Ch√°vez Jr.'s listless performance and history of discipline issues throughout his career.</p>
