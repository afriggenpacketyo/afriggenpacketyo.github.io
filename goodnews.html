          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-centric fundraising events this month, including a $1.5 million-per-plate dinner for political donors and a gala for holders of the $TRUMP memetoken. The first event, hosted by MAGA Inc., features David Sacks, who is influencing crypto and AI regulations, signaling a policy shift welcomed by the crypto community after perceived opposition from the Biden administration. The second event offers access to Trump's inner circle based on the number of $TRUMP tokens held, with top holders promised dinner with Trump himself, highlighting the intersection of crypto culture and political fundraising. MAGA Inc. will receive the funds, however the president is constitutionally barred from running for a third term.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway's shares experienced a decline after Warren Buffett revealed his plans to step down as CEO, naming Greg Abel as his successor, which the board unanimously approved, effective January 1, 2026. The market reacted to this news alongside an earnings decline, causing Class A shares to drop 4.9% to $769,593 and Class B shares to fall to $513.17. While investors process the transition, analysts like Macrae Sykes emphasize Buffett's continued role as chairman will provide mentorship and strategic guidance during this period of change. This succession marks the end of Buffett's 60-year leadership, transforming Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1.2 trillion conglomerate.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce that Washington, D.C., will host the 2027 NFL Draft, with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders owner Josh Harris present for the announcement. The three-day event will be held on the National Mall, marking the first time the draft has taken place at that location. This announcement follows plans by the Commanders and city officials to return the team to D.C. with a new domed facility by 2030, though D.C. Council approval is still needed. Trump's relationship with the NFL has been complex, ranging from owning a USFL team and suing the NFL to publicly criticizing player protests and maintaining close ties with some NFL owners.</p>

          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, Warren Buffett announced his plan to step down as CEO at the end of the year, naming Greg Abel as his successor, a move that visibly impacted attendees. Buffett, often seen as the conscience of capitalism, is admired for his humility and educational approach to business and investing. While Abel has been managing large parts of Berkshire's operations, questions remain about maintaining Buffett's unique vision and autonomy. The future of the annual meeting and its impact on the company and Omaha are also uncertain as the investment world prepares for this significant transition.</p>

          <p>Hollywood studio stocks experienced brief declines following President Trump's proposal of a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas, with shares of Netflix, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery temporarily falling. Trump cited tax incentives offered by foreign countries as a national security threat, but the implementation and scope of these duties remain unclear. Experts worry about the impact on relationships with other countries and the potential for retaliation, as Hollywood relies heavily on international box office sales. It is unclear what part of the production process would be hit with this duty, and questions are already swirling.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made varying statements regarding the possibility of seeking a third term in office, despite constitutional limitations. While initially suggesting potential methods to bypass these limitations, he later downplayed the idea, stating he will be a two-term president. Despite this, Trump has acknowledged the strong requests for him to run again, and allies have explored options such as a constitutional amendment. Experts suggest that his earlier comments might have been a strategic move to maintain influence and avoid being perceived as a lame-duck president, even though changing the Constitution is considered highly unlikely.</p>

This decision follows a similar increase in May and comes amid concerns about a potential recession due to Trump's tariffs, which could slow demand. Goldman Sachs has cut its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year, expecting investment in exploration and production to decline due to the weak price environment.

The model, outlined at a rare central party conference on periphery diplomacy in April, echoed Xi‚Äôs 2014 call for Asians to independently manage their own security and also capitalised on regional doubts about Washington‚Äôs dependability, they said. But analysts cautioned that Beijing‚Äôs efforts to project itself as a benign security partner remain challenging, amid escalating territorial disputes with its neighbours, notably in the South China Sea, and the escalating rivalry with Washington.</p>
