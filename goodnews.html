          <p>Mark Zuckerberg has introduced the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the company's first consumer smart glasses featuring a built-in high-resolution display, priced at $799. The device can be controlled by hand gestures via a neural-powered wristband, allowing users to watch videos or respond to messages. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's audio-only smart glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects. The launch also included new Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes and an updated version of the original Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p>

          <p>American tennis star Taylor Townsend issued a heartfelt apology after her social media posts criticizing unfamiliar foods at a tournament in China sparked accusations of cultural insensitivity. Townsend had posted videos expressing shock at seeing dishes like bullfrogs and turtles, which led to a significant backlash online. In a subsequent video, she apologized sincerely, stating she is privileged to experience different cultures through her travels and that her comments did not reflect her overall positive experience in the country. The incident underscores the heightened scrutiny athletes face on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently, forecasters do not anticipate any immediate threat to land, as the storm is expected to remain over open waters for several days. However, the system is projected to intensify, potentially reaching low-grade hurricane status over the weekend. Its track could bring it near Bermuda next week, but the overall forecast remains uncertain as the storm continues to develop and organize.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in parts of Africa consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented fruits. Scientists chemically analyzed the figs and plums that are staples of the chimps' diet and measured their ethanol content. This discovery provides the first direct chemical evidence of regular alcohol consumption by wild primates. The findings lend strong support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that the human attraction to alcohol has deep evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our ancestors.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has strongly recommended against scrapping the individual care plans used for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). In a new report, the Education Select Committee urged the government to maintain the current system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The MPs also called for new national minimum standards for SEND support in schools and better training for all teachers. The recommendations aim to improve a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable and inconsistent.</p>

          <p>Liverpool began their Champions League campaign with a dramatic 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid, secured by a Virgil van Dijk header deep into stoppage time. In a recurring theme this season, Liverpool relinquished an early 2-0 lead before mounting a late comeback to win at Anfield. The match also marked the debut for Alexander Isak, the club's £125 million record signing from Newcastle United. While Isak showed glimpses of his potential, it was the team's familiar resilience that ultimately earned them the three points in a thrilling contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. However, with UK inflation remaining at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are expected to pause further cuts for the remainder of the year to avoid fueling price rises. This cautious approach contrasts with recent rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, reflecting different domestic economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

He argued that the move did not upend any major market themes and that the mixed market reaction could even present buying opportunities. Cramer described the Fed as being in a tough position, balancing a weaker labor market with ongoing inflation, and praised Chair Jerome Powell's approach as prudent and steady in a complex economic environment.

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has lowered its base interest rate for the first time this year, matching the 25-basis-point cut made by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Due to the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar, the city's monetary policy typically follows that of the Fed. The move aims to reduce borrowing costs to support local businesses and ease the burden on mortgage holders. The Fed's decision was influenced by signs of a weakening U.S. labor market, potentially marking the beginning of a global rate-cutting cycle. (not investment advice)</p>
