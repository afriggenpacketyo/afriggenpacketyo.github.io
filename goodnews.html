          <h2>Chinese Energy Investments in Africa Increasingly Focused on Renewables</h2>

          <p>A report by ODI Global reveals that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable energy projects, with solar and wind power constituting 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, as exports surged 153% from 2020 to 2024. This shift aligns with global trends indicating China's energy investment moving away from fossil fuels to renewables, driven by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. Elena Kiryakova from ODI Global attributes this trend to the global competitiveness of Chinese tech and Africa's growing energy requirements.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Middle East to secure investment, trade, and technology deals from Gulf leaders, focusing on oil, trade, and regional conflicts, including the Israel-Gaza war. Trump aims to emphasize his 'America First' policy by securing multi-billion dollar deals, with Saudi Arabia already committing to invest $1 trillion into the US economy. Discussions will also involve access to advanced US semiconductor exports and Saudi Arabia's interest in civilian nuclear infrastructure, with the administration indicating that these issues are no longer tied to the country's normalization of relations with Israel. The article notes the absence of plans to visit Israel, highlighting tensions between the US and Israel regarding the Gaza conflict.</p>

The Home Office will be informed of all foreign nationals convicted of any offense, granting officials wider powers to remove them from the UK. New government plans aim to prevent foreign criminals from exploiting human rights laws to avoid deportation, marking the biggest overhaul of immigration laws since Brexit. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper states that the new rules are essential to regain control of immigration and end the chaos left by previous administrations.</p>

Ross criticizes the tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers for their children‚Äôs problems and encourages mothers to recognize that they are good enough.

Kim, a former labor activist, thanked his supporters and pledged to secure victory in the crucial election.

The breakthrough, published in Science Robotics, highlights the potential for drones to execute high-risk maneuvers previously considered unstable. This technology draws inspiration from nature, where aerial acrobatics are essential for species like sparrowhawks and bats to hunt or avoid obstacles. Gao Fei from Zhejiang University emphasizes that this research redefines traditional drone flight paradigms by transforming 'high-risk maneuvers' into 'high-survival rewards'.</p>
