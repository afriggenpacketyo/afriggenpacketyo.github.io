          <h2>US and Canada Dispute Responsibility for Wildfire Smoke</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 21:17:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American lawmakers are blaming Canada for wildfire smoke affecting the Midwest, prompting a debate over wildfire management and climate change. The Canadian government has responded, calling the accusations a "timber tantrum", as data indicates 2025 is on track to be Canada's second-worst wildfire season. Experts say climate change is exacerbating the issue, with wildfires worsening in both countries. Collaboration on pollution and climate is essential, as both countries would benefit from working together on wildfires instead of assigning blame, as even though the fires are burning in Canada, their impact can reach far beyond. The focus should be on adaptation and prevention to mitigate future deaths, as this issue is not going away anytime soon.</p>

          <p>Matthew McConaughey stars with his mother and son in "The Lost Bus," a film about the 2018 California wildfires, which is based on a true story. The film depicts a school bus driver navigating 22 children and their teacher through the raging wildfires. Director Paul Greengrass focused on realism, using McConaughey's family members in the cast and building real sets. The film aims to capture the universal human story of grappling with the idea of having left it too late in the face of global dangers. One of the producers, Jamie Lee Curtis, hopes the film will be the most important thing she has ever done.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after his suspension drew a much larger audience than average, despite preemptions by some ABC affiliates. The episode garnered 6.26 million viewers, significantly higher than the show's season average of 1.42 million, and also achieved its highest rating in the 18-49 demographic since March 2015. Kimmel's monologue also generated over 26 million views on YouTube and other social platforms, and in it, he addressed President Trump's criticism of the show's ratings. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, leading to controversy and debate over free speech.</p>

Al-Sharaa criticized Israel's recent attacks on Hamas leaders in Qatar and airstrikes near Syria's presidential palace. He emphasized the need for respecting borders and international standards to avoid global chaos, as Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian head of state to address the UN General Assembly in nearly 60 years. Negotiations are ongoing for a security agreement between Syria and Israel, aiming to de-escalate tensions and ensure regional stability.</p>

          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's Attempt to Tie FEMA Grants to Immigration Cooperation</h2>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration cannot require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive FEMA grants, deeming the policy unconstitutional. The lawsuit was brought by 20 states, mostly Democratic, which argued the policy held emergency preparedness funding hostage. The states argued the move violates federal law and the Constitution, and could deprive them of billions per year in key disaster grants from FEMA. The ruling follows a monthslong effort by the Trump administration to punish "sanctuary" cities and states that limit cooperation between police and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

The annual event, which began in 2014, allows people worldwide to vote for their favorite fat bear. Scientists estimate that the bears can gain up to 700 pounds before winter, and the winner's prize is surviving another season. This year's contenders include familiar faces like 32 Chunk, the runner-up from last year, and new bears like 602, nicknamed "Flow-tato."</p>

          <p>A family reports their nonverbal son with autism began speaking after trying leucovorin, a drug typically used to treat chemo side effects. Dr. Richard Frye is studying leucovorin, derived from folic acid, as a potential treatment for some autistic children with cerebral folate deficiency, as the FDA has begun the process of approving leucovorin as a treatment for autism. The theory is that the drug can bypass a blockage in folic acid transport to the brain, improving speech ability, and there is evidence that there's a familial or genetic predisposition for developing FR⍺ autoantibodies. While the side effects are mild, there is a challenge because nobody is going to make a lot of money on it.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, according to the US Geological Survey. The epicenter was located near Mene Grande, an oil town in the state of Zulia, and the quake was felt in Caracas and Maracaibo. There were no immediate reports of casualties or serious damage, as strong temblors are not common in Venezuela. The quake was also felt in neighboring Colombia and Caribbean islands, and Venezuela is the country with the world's largest proven crude oil reserves.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring financial support options for companies in Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain after a cyber attack halted car production. With JLR factories remaining suspended until next month, there are concerns that smaller suppliers reliant on JLR's business could face bankruptcy. Options being considered include government purchasing component parts, providing government-backed loans, or stockpiling car parts. The Business and Trade Select Committee is scheduled to meet to hear testimonies from businesses in JLR's supply chain, as senior government figures are concerned about cyber attacks on UK institutions.</p>

          <p>Science minister Patrick Vallance stated that the price the NHS pays for medicines will need to rise to prevent pharmaceutical investment from leaving the UK. His comments follow announcements from drug companies either pausing or scrapping UK projects, but critics in the sector say low prices for new drugs, a lack of government investment, and tariff pressure from US President Donald Trump have been pushing firms away from the UK. According to the government, Moderna is investing more than a £1bn in UK research and development as part of a 10-year partnership to create new treatments jobs and boost pandemic resilience.</p>

          <p>European captain Luke Donald suggested his team are "fuelled by something money can’t buy" in a statement appearing to dig at their American rivals, as all 12 of the American team - plus captain Keegan Bradley - are being given $500,000 (£370,000), with $300,000 (£220,000) of that going to a charity of their choice. Donald emphasized that the Ryder Cup is about pride, representing one's flag, and leaving a legacy, and is not about prize money or ranking points. Earlier, Collin Morikawa dismissed the idea that the US players receiving payment might mean they have less desire than Europe's team, and says the financial support means the players can help people they "care about".</p>
