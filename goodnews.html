        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN analyst Jay Williams suggests that 'cancel culture' may be a contributing factor to the NBA's recent drought of American MVP winners, with the last American MVP being James Harden in 2018. Williams argues that today's players are overly sensitive and that coaches are hesitant to coach them hard due to fear of backlash. He advocates for coaches to instill accountability and allow players to face adversity, and also states that international players have dominated the MVP race recently, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo being the top three finalists. Jayson Tatum was the highest American finisher, in fourth place.</p>

          <p>More than a century after it sank, the final resting place of the WWI-era submarine USS F-1 has been captured in unprecedented high-definition images off the coast of San Diego. The submarine was lost at sea during a training accident in 1917, resulting in the deaths of 19 crew members, and an interagency team used cutting-edge deep-sea imaging technology to survey the wreck. The team also captured images of a U.S. Navy Avenger torpedo bomber that crashed in the same area in 1950, and after the dives, a remembrance ceremony was held on board Atlantis, honoring the lost crew members.</p>

Fetterman blames the weaponization of his openness about mental health struggles for the negative attention and expresses frustration over the constant questions about his well-being, while also praising the weight-loss drug Mounjaro for improving his mental clarity and optimism.</p>
