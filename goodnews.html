        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the 2025-26 academic year approaches, students and families are evaluating whether federal or private loans offer more favorable interest rates. Federal undergraduate loans for the upcoming year are set at a fixed 6.39%, available to all borrowers regardless of credit history. In contrast, private lenders are offering rates as low as 3.2% for applicants with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer, potentially offering significant savings. However, private loan rates can be much higher for those with weaker credit and lack the robust protections, like income-driven repayment plans, that federal loans provide.

          <p>Universal Studios has submitted planning documents for a major new theme park in Bedfordshire, UK, which could feature rides up to 377 feet tall, making them the highest in Europe. The company is seeking a special development order to fast-track government approval, bypassing local planning procedures. The proposed park aims to attract 8.5 million visitors annually and includes plans for a 500-room hotel, extensive parking, and significant transport infrastructure upgrades, including a new railway station junction. If approved, the resort is projected to open by 2031, creating thousands of local jobs.</p>

          <p>Cloud computing provider CoreWeave has become the first company to commercially deploy Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell Ultra AI chips. The systems, built by Dell, are liquid-cooled and feature 72 Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which Nvidia claims can generate 50 times more AI content than their predecessors. This milestone is a significant win for both Nvidia, demonstrating a smooth production rollout, and CoreWeave, which gains a competitive edge by offering the latest technology ahead of larger rivals like Amazon and Microsoft. The announcement underscores the intense demand for cutting-edge AI hardware and CoreWeave's close strategic relationship with Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has released a 10-year plan to reform England's National Health Service (NHS), emphasizing a shift from hospital-centric care to community-based services. The strategy includes creating up to 300 neighborhood health hubs, launching an "ambitious moonshot" to combat obesity, and improving mental health support with dedicated A&E departments. Additionally, the plan aims to expand access to dental care and enhance digital services through the NHS app. Critics question the plan's funding, staffing, and its lack of focus on the interconnected social care crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States labor market demonstrated surprising resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and lowering the unemployment rate to 4.1%. These figures surpassed economists' expectations, which had anticipated a slowdown due to the ongoing trade war initiated by the Trump administration. Growth was primarily driven by hiring in state government and healthcare, while the federal government continued to shed positions. Despite the positive report, concerns remain that the full economic impact of tariffs has yet to be reflected in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence from Portugal, a half-century marked by significant development. Since 1975, the country has made remarkable strides in education and healthcare, drastically reducing illiteracy and increasing life expectancy to nearly 75 years, one of the highest in Africa. Despite this progress, challenges like youth unemployment and emigration persist, with many young, educated citizens seeking opportunities abroad. The nation, now considered one of Africa's most stable democracies, continues to focus on social policies to combat poverty and support vulnerable populations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Roman statesman and philosopher Marcus Tullius Cicero, in his work "De Officiis," argued that true happiness and success are achieved by choosing the virtuous path, even when it is difficult. He contended that there is no conflict between doing good and doing well, as honorable behavior ultimately leads to the most enduring rewards. Cicero's reasoning suggests that actions like dishonesty or disloyalty, while offering short-term gains, degrade one's character and reputation, undermining long-term success. Modern social science supports his claims, showing that virtues like generosity, honesty, and fidelity are strongly correlated with lasting life satisfaction.</p>

Evans, who has struggled with form and injuries, had difficulty countering Djokovic's powerful serve and relentless returns. The win marks Djokovic's 99th career victory at the tournament as he continues his quest to equal Roger Federer's record of eight Wimbledon men's singles titles and secure a record 25th Grand Slam.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was largely powered by significant hiring in the government sector, which added 73,000 jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this accounted for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month. Most of this growth occurred at the state and local levels, particularly in education. In contrast, the federal government continued to reduce its workforce, shedding another 7,000 jobs as part of the Trump administration's ongoing cost-cutting initiatives. The healthcare and social assistance sector also saw strong growth. (not investment advice)</p>
