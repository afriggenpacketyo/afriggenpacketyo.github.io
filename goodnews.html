          <p>A Japanese Defense Ministry panel proposes that the government consider increasing defense spending beyond the current 2% of GDP target. The proposal also suggests exploring the deployment of long-range missile-equipped submarines, including nuclear-powered ones, to enhance deterrence.  Funding and potential conflicts with Japan's peaceful atomic energy policy remain key concerns regarding the proposal's implementation. The panel advocates for achieving the 2% target ahead of schedule and developing future defense strategies.</p>
