          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing conservative and EU skeptic, has been elected as the Polish president, raising questions about the future of EU-Poland relations. While Nawrocki is officially non-partisan, he was backed by the Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has clashed with Brussels over judicial reforms. Experts believe Nawrocki could obstruct the government's EU policy by vetoing national legislation implementing EU directives, particularly in areas like the rule of law, abortion, migration, and climate policy. Despite concerns, neither PiS nor Nawrocki have called for Poland's exit from the EU. The optimism score is not related to this summary.</p>
