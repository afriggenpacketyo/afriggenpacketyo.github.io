        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has raised trade-in prices for iPhones in China to boost demand in a crucial market where it faces increasing competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. The increased trade-in values, though modest, signal Apple's ongoing efforts to galvanize sales in the world's second-largest economy. This move comes after a reported 8% year-on-year drop in China shipments and a decline in market share during the first quarter. Apple is also navigating challenges related to its supply chain and potential tariffs on electronics manufactured in China, where around 90% of its iPhones are produced.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem has announced that energy bills in the UK will fall by 7% in July, marking the first drop in a year for 21 million households. This decrease will reduce the typical annual bill by ¬£129, but charities warn that many people still struggle to pay due to accumulated debt. The drop reflects a fall in international wholesale gas prices, though prices remain high compared to previous years. The announcement follows recent hikes in energy, water, and council tax bills, and there are concerns about the impact on vulnerable households, particularly those with children.</p>
