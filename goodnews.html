          <p>Pakistan has taken on the rotating one-month presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a position it holds for the eighth time. The role is largely symbolic but comes during a period of significant global instability and heightened geopolitical tensions. Pakistani officials have stated their commitment to peaceful conflict resolution while acknowledging the challenging international landscape. The presidency is expected to see Pakistan raise the issue of its recent conflict with India over the disputed Kashmir territory.</p>

          <p>This article argues that French cinema has largely failed to confront the nation's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade and its colonial past, unlike American filmmaking. The author notes that mainstream depictions of this history are rare in France, leaving audiences to learn about it from Hollywood productions. However, the piece highlights a few recent and powerful independent films, such as "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon, that are beginning to address this historical void, suggesting audiences are ready for these narratives.</p>

          <p>Technology experts are emphasizing the need for nations to develop "sovereign AI," which refers to a country's ability to control its own artificial intelligence technologies, data, and infrastructure. At a recent conference, panelists argued that this approach allows for AI systems tailored to specific languages and cultures, rather than relying on English-based models from a few dominant companies. They highlighted open-source models and accessible cloud computing as key tools for emerging economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, to build their own AI ecosystems.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers showed unexpected growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index rose to 50.4, rebounding from a contraction in May and defying analyst expectations. This positive reading, which contrasts with official government data, was supported by the fastest expansion in production since November. However, the report also signaled potential headwinds, as new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law major housing legislation designed to accelerate construction across California by reforming the state's landmark environmental law. The new laws significantly reduce the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for most urban housing projects, a move intended to cut through regulatory delays and litigation that often stall development. Experts believe these are the most consequential changes to CEQA in its 55-year history and could provide immediate relief for homebuilders.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has agreed to rescind its digital services tax, which would have affected large U.S. technology companies like Google and Meta. The decision came after former President Trump threatened to raise tariffs and called off trade talks in response to the planned tax. The White House press secretary described Canada's reversal as a result of caving to pressure and a "big victory" for American companies. Following the move, trade negotiations between the U.S. and Canada have resumed.</p>

          <p>A U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops who were deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration to help fight wildfires instead. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the roughly 4,000 Guard members from their controversial deployment in L.A., which was initiated over the governor's objections to deal with protests. This potential shift comes as California officials have warned that the L.A. deployment could impede the state's response to an expectedly active wildfire season.</p>

          <p>Beachgoers along the northern and central coast of Portugal were treated to a rare and spectacular weather phenomenon during a recent heatwave. A massive, tube-shaped cloud, known as a "roll cloud," formed over the ocean, stretching across the horizon. This type of low-level, horizontal cloud is detached from other cloud formations and appears to be rolling. The unusual sight amazed locals and weather experts alike, with many capturing and sharing images and videos of the event on social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has identified a potential key to how long-term exercise slows the ageing process. Their research found that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during exercise, helps prevent inflammation and the ageing of multiple organs. The study, published in the journal Cell, revealed that betaine works by inhibiting a specific enzyme linked to inflammation. These findings could pave the way for new anti-ageing strategies that simulate the beneficial effects of physical activity.</p>
