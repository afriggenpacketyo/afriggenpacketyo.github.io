          <p>Actor Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has garnered significant public attention after appearing noticeably leaner at the Venice Film Festival. Fans expressed surprise on social media, with many commenting on his slimmer physique while attending an event for his new film, "The Smashing Machine." In the movie, Johnson portrays former MMA fighter Mark Kerr, a role that required a significant physical transformation and has already generated awards buzz. Johnson explained that he was hungry to take on such a different role to break away from being typecast as an action star, crediting his co-stars for giving him the confidence to pursue it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a Labour peer and Sir Keir Starmer's former chief of staff, has questioned the UK government's decision to restrict a civil service internship scheme exclusively to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Arguing from her own working-class background, Gray stated that she benefited greatly from exposure to people from diverse walks of life and questioned the evidence base for the new policy. The government contends the change will widen the talent pool and make the civil service more reflective of the country. However, Gray suggests that while well-intentioned, there are better ways to open up the civil service.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man was arrested in Orange County after allegedly sending threatening emails to St. Michael’s Abbey and later making in-person threats. The suspect, identified as 38-year-old Joshua Michael Richardson, was taken into custody for making criminal threats. A search of his vehicle revealed a cache of weapons, including body armor, high-capacity magazines, knives, and brass knuckles, according to the Sheriff's Department. Authorities highlighted the importance of community vigilance, urging the public to report any suspicious activity to prevent potential crimes before they can occur, emphasizing the "if you see something, say something" principle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant departure from the standard "evacuate immediately" directive, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone is now supporting the idea of training residents to stay and defend their homes during wildfires. Marrone stated that with proper training, equipment, and home hardening, it is possible for homeowners to safely prevent their properties from burning down. This shift in strategy acknowledges the reality that there are not enough firefighters to protect every structure during massive fire events. The department has already created a community brigade to train residents, motivated by the fact that many homes have been saved by civilians who stayed behind.</p>

          <h2>New Secondary Cockpit Barriers Being Implemented on Commercial Aircraft to Enhance Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 20:37:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nearly 25 years after the 9/11 attacks, a new security enhancement is being rolled out on commercial airplanes in the form of secondary cockpit barriers. These retractable, folding doors are designed to block access to the flight deck when the main cockpit door is open, providing an extra layer of protection against potential hijackings.

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ruled that Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, can resume her position after being fired by President Donald Trump. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being removed by a president without cause, upholding a legal precedent that insulates independent regulatory agencies from partisan political pressure. The ruling rejected the Trump administration's request to delay her reinstatement during its appeal. This legal battle is seen as a significant test of the independence of federal agencies, with the dispute likely to be ultimately decided by the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of all claims in a $24 million civil lawsuit filed by a security guard who alleged the artist assaulted and spat on her in 2018. The jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding the rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, not liable for assault, battery, and emotional distress. During the trial, Cardi B testified that while a heated verbal altercation occurred, she never physically touched the guard. Her case was supported by testimony from a doctor's receptionist who claimed the security guard was the aggressor during the confrontation outside a medical office.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued remedies in the landmark antitrust case against Google, ordering the company to share search data with competitors but stopping short of forcing it to sell its Chrome web browser. The ruling, from District Judge Amit Mehta, follows his earlier decision that Google illegally maintained a monopoly in online search. Under the new order, Google will be barred from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default on devices. While the Department of Justice had sought a more drastic structural breakup, the decision is seen as a significant move to restore competition in the search market.</p>

          <p>U.S. filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court battle against Rochdale Borough Council in the UK to gain ownership of Hopwood Hall, his ancestral stately home. DePree, who documented his seven-year effort to save the crumbling 15th-century hall in his book "Downton Shabby," claims he fulfilled an agreement giving him the option to purchase the building. However, the council argues he failed to meet the conditions, which included providing a commercially viable business plan, and locked him out last year. DePree alleges the council acted in bad faith and is now seeking a court order to be declared the legal owner.</p>

Among the claims is a story that Queen Camilla, as a teenager, fought off a sexual assault on a train and had the perpetrator arrested. The book also asserts that the late Queen Elizabeth II was privately in favor of remaining in the European Union. Other details include the UK government's push for a "maximalist" Coronation for King Charles III despite Palace concerns about cost, and insights into the late Queen's relationships with various prime ministers.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, shooting fountains of lava up to 330 feet into the air from its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 32nd eruptive episode since the current activity began in December 2024, with all lava so far being contained within Halemaʻumaʻu crater inside Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, magma is being supplied to a lower chamber and then forced to the surface through established vents. Scientists are monitoring the volcano closely, noting that while the spectacular fountains continue, the eruption's future behavior remains unpredictable.</p>

          <p>UK authorities are warning the public about an increase in sophisticated parking fine scams, from fraudulent text messages to tampered payment machines. Scams often involve fake texts with urgent language and links to clone websites designed to steal financial information. Another common tactic involves "skimming" devices attached to parking machines that steal card details. To stay safe, experts advise checking that any fine notice includes your vehicle registration, the time, and location of the offense. Additionally, people should be wary of clicking links in unsolicited texts and physically inspect payment machines for any signs of tampering before use.</p>

The legislation targets Chinese officials who fail to take action against the trafficking of the synthetic opioid and its precursor chemicals. It also makes it easier to sanction Chinese companies that do not implement "know-your-customer" procedures or cooperate with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts. While the bill received support from both parties, some Democrats emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and that effective diplomacy and law enforcement partnerships with China and Mexico are also essential to address the crisis.</p>

          <p>In a sharply worded opinion, federal Judge Charles Breyer has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement purposes in Los Angeles was a "serious violation" of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law bars the use of the military for domestic law enforcement except under specific circumstances authorized by Congress. The judge's ruling concluded that the administration knowingly circumvented the law by creating a "constitutional exception" to justify the deployment. This decision serves as a significant legal rebuke of the administration's expansive view of executive power and could impact its plans for similar deployments in other U.S. cities.</p>
