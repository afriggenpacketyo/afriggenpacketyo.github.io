          <p>Turkey has emerged as a key player in the recent Gaza peace deal between Israel and Hamas, following high-level diplomatic engagement involving President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and U.S. President Donald Trump. Ankara, which maintains close ties with Hamas, was asked to help persuade the group to agree to the terms, with Turkey's intelligence chief joining the final talks in Egypt. As part of the implementation, Turkey is expected to contribute to a multinational task force, potentially assisting in locating the remains of Israeli hostages. This development marks a significant shift for Turkey from a bystander to a central negotiator in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to reduce the cost of its drugs in the United States. The deal, similar to a previous one with Pfizer, will require AstraZeneca to sell drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. This initiative is part of President Trump's broader effort to combat high prescription drug costs by pressuring pharmaceutical companies with the threat of significant tariffs. In return for price cuts and investment in U.S. manufacturing, companies may receive exemptions from these tariffs, a strategy aimed at making medicines more affordable for American consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicha, a uniquely Peruvian music genre, represents a complex fusion of cultural influences that reflects the nation's identity. Originating in the 1960s from a blend of Colombian cumbia, Andean huayno, and psychedelic rock, chicha became the voice of marginalized Andean migrants in Lima. Artists like Chacalón and the band Los Shapis rose to stardom in the '80s by singing about the struggles and experiences of the working class, turning the genre into a mass cultural movement. The term itself is controversial, sometimes used pejoratively but also celebrated as a symbol of popular art and resilience, remaining a vibrant part of Peru's cultural landscape today.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pressure on Netanyahu Was Crucial in Securing Gaza Ceasefire Deal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's direct and sustained pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was the decisive factor in achieving the recent Gaza ceasefire agreement. After months of allowing the conflict to escalate, Trump reportedly became personally invested in ending the war, leveraging U.S. influence and weapons supplies to force Netanyahu's compliance. A tense phone call, in which Trump reportedly snapped at Netanyahu to accept the deal, is highlighted as a key moment. The author contends that for the fragile peace to hold, Trump must continue to apply this same level of pressure to prevent the agreement from collapsing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are weighing the role of precious metals like gold and silver in retirement portfolios, highlighting their potential as a hedge against inflation and a tool for diversification. While gold is praised for its historical resilience and ability to maintain purchasing power during economic uncertainty, it also presents risks. These drawbacks include the lack of dividends or interest, potential for price volatility, and higher tax rates on gains compared to stocks. Financial planners suggest that while these assets can provide stability, retirees should also consider the costs of storage and insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, the recipient of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, publicly thanked President Donald Trump for his "decisive support" of her democratic cause. Her statement came shortly after the White House criticized the Nobel Committee for not selecting Trump, claiming it placed "politics over peace." Despite the administration's complaints, Trump reportedly called Machado to congratulate her on the award. This interaction highlights the complex political dynamics surrounding the prestigious prize, with the winner acknowledging the support of the very person whose administration felt he was more deserving of the honor.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Why Central Banks Continue to Accumulate Gold Reserves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 14:20:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Central banks worldwide are continuing to purchase large quantities of gold, driven by a need for diversification, stability, and security in an uncertain global economy. According to experts, gold serves as a crucial hedge against inflation and operates outside the traditional banking system, making it immune to sanctions that can affect currency reserves. The precious metal's limited supply and historical record as a stable store of value provide financial security with no counterparty risk. This strategic accumulation strengthens a central bank's capital ratios, enhances its ability to manage crises, and maintains trust in its financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve beginning to cut its benchmark rate, owners of certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing in November are advised to act proactively to secure favorable returns. As CD yields soften, it is crucial to review the bank's maturity notice and grace period rules to avoid automatically rolling funds into a lower-yielding account. Experts recommend shopping around for the best available rates on new CDs or high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer comparable returns with greater liquidity. Evaluating financial needs and comparing options before the maturity date can help savers optimize their strategy in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners with high mortgage rates are exploring refinancing options to lower their monthly payments. A good refinance rate is subjective, but experts suggest that even a half-percentage-point reduction can be beneficial, while a full point is generally recommended. Current average rates for 15-year and 30-year fixed mortgages are hovering around 5.87% and 6.51% respectively, making refinancing a viable option for many who bought homes in recent years. Homeowners can also consider adjustable-rate mortgages or purchasing mortgage points to secure an even lower rate in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>
