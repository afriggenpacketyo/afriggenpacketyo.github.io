          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, indicating a recovery in demand for its x86 processors for PCs, causing its stock to jump 6% in extended trading. The chipmaker received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government as part of an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration, making the government a top shareholder. Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, planning to integrate Intel's CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. Despite accounting complexities due to the government shutdown, Intel remains committed to advancing U.S. semiconductor production and expects chip demand to continue outpacing supply next year.</p>

          <p>President Trump canceled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, a move that had drawn widespread condemnation and protests. The reversal came after discussions with Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley leaders, with Trump confirming the decision on Truth Social, stating he would give Lurie a chance to address the situation. California leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, had vowed legal challenges, calling the proposed deployment a "dictator's handbook" tactic.

          <p>Switzerland has secured the top position in the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s (WIPO) annual Global Innovation Index (GII) for the 15th consecutive year, with China ranking 10th overall. This consistent result has sparked debate among some Chinese internet users, who questioned the methodology and authority of the index. Despite China's significant output in science and technology, its lower overall ranking has led to discussions about potential biases in the GII's assessment framework. This article highlights the ongoing scrutiny of international rankings and their perception within different national contexts, particularly concerning innovation metrics.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off an undisclosed number of employees in its risk organization as it transitions to using artificial intelligence to automate its compliance review process. The risk organization, established after a $5 billion FTC fine related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, is responsible for assessing product risks and ensuring global regulatory compliance. These job reductions are part of broader organizational restructurings at Meta, including recent cuts in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit. This article notes that the company's revamped system relies on basic automation rather than advanced generative AI, aiming to streamline risk management and reduce human error while maintaining high compliance standards.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland informed Department of Justice superiors that she does not believe there is sufficient evidence to charge Senator Adam Schiff of California with mortgage fraud. This report comes after President Trump had publicly called for Schiff's criminal indictment, given Schiff's role as a staunch critic and prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Despite the Maryland U.S. Attorney's assessment, sources indicate that a controversial senior Justice Department official is pressing to keep the investigation alive. This article highlights the ongoing political tensions surrounding legal scrutiny of Trump's opponents and the internal disagreements within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK, with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) ruling that the tech giant abused its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair App Store commission fees. Lawyers representing Dr. Rachael Kent, who brought the case on behalf of 36 million iPhone and iPad users, claim Apple made "exorbitant profits" by blocking competition for app distribution and in-app purchases. Apple, which faces mounting regulatory pressure globally, plans to appeal the decision, which could result in £1.5 billion in damages for purchases made over the past decade. This article underscores a significant legal challenge to Apple's business practices, potentially leading to substantial compensation for consumers.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has seen a rare and significant drop, falling 6% in a single day, prompting investors to consider purchasing the metal from retailers like Costco or Walmart. With gold still relatively high at over $4,000 per ounce, this decline offers a new, more affordable entry point for investors. Many shoppers who bought gold from Costco since 2023 have already seen substantial gains, and the retailer offers a convenient and trustworthy path to physical bullion. This article suggests that price dips in the gold market are typically temporary, positioning current buyers for potential future profits, though Costco's gold sales are final, requiring careful consideration before purchase (not investment advice).</p>
