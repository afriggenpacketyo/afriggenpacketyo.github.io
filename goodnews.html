        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese humanoid robot startup X Square Robot has successfully secured approximately $100 million in its latest funding round, primarily led by Alibaba Cloud. This substantial investment marks the Shenzhen-based company's eighth financing round in under two years, accumulating a total of $280 million. The company simultaneously launched Wall-OSS, an open-source AI foundation model for robotics, and its Quanta X2 robot, which features advanced human-like functionalities. This move underscores the intensifying global race in AI-integrated robotics, with X Square Robot aiming for "robotic butlers" within five years. They also anticipate bringing down consumer prices to around $10,000 in three to five years, a critical step for mass market adoption, despite current AI for robots lagging behind generative AI advancements.</p>

          <h2>China-US Study Reveals Mars Possesses an Unexpected Solid Inner Core</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by China and the US, utilizing seismic data from NASA's now-retired InSight lander, has made a surprising discovery: Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600 kilometers (373 miles) in radius. This finding challenges previous assumptions, as Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form such a core, unlike Earth and the Moon. The existence of this solid core, representing about 18% of Mars's radius, could prompt a re-evaluation of the planet's geological evolution. This significant scientific advancement offers new insights into planetary formation and could revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, particularly Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix, saw significant gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend. Investors reacted positively, with market analysts suggesting excitement around potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, who are viewed as growth-oriented and keen on deregulation. The yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to rise amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty, reflecting investor pricing of tighter monetary policy. This political shift introduces a period of extended uncertainty for Japan's Q4 2025, with potential for further market fluctuations depending on the new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German company Neura showcased its humanoid robots, 4NE1 and MiPA, at IFA 2025, suggesting they could soon enter the mainstream market. These robots are designed to perform "dirty, dull, or dangerous" tasks in enterprise settings, with future plans to allow developers to create additional skills, akin to an app store model. While hardware is advanced, AI capabilities are still evolving through repetition and learning from real-world interaction. Neura explicitly stated its commitment to serving humanity by not engaging in military activities. The company anticipates consumers might wait a few more years for widespread availability, but factory deployment is already underway, indicating significant progress.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title, defeating Jannik Sinner in a match notably delayed by former President Trump's attendance. Trump, present in a luxury box, received a mixed reception from the crowd, and enhanced security measures caused significant entry delays for ticketholders. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly advised broadcasters to mute crowd reactions to Trump, which NPR could not independently verify. This high-profile event also saw Trump's appearance with Rolex, a Swiss company, just weeks after imposing tariffs on Swiss products, adding a political dimension to the sports spectacle and raising questions about the intersection of politics and major events.</p>

          <p>Paul Nowak, General Secretary of the UK's Trades Union Congress (TUC), is urging the Labour government to demonstrate its commitment to working-class communities following a recent cabinet reshuffle. He plans to call for the lifting of the two-child benefit cap, funded by new wealth taxes, to make Labour's promise of change a "lived reality." Unite union leader Sharon Graham echoed this sentiment, warning of potential disaffiliation from Labour if living standards don't improve and highlighting the rise of Reform UK as a potential beneficiary. This pressure highlights significant concerns within the labor movement regarding the government's direction and its impact on workers' rights.</p>

          <p>Global investors are increasingly diversifying away from US equities for the first time in a decade, attracted by Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market and anticipated looser Federal Reserve monetary policy. Bank of America reports a significant shift of capital into Asia, with the region's AI market projected to quadruple from $300 billion in 2025 to nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030. This reallocation is also driven by a weakening US dollar and more attractive valuations in Asian stocks compared to expensive US counterparts. The trend signals a strategic pivot in global investment flows, highlighting new opportunities and challenges in the international financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, Europe, and Africa witnessed a spectacular "Blood Moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that makes the moon appear an eerie deep red. The red hue results from sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily, a process similar to how sunsets appear red. This celestial event, which has captivated humanity for millennia, provided a stunning visual display for observers in various parts of the world, reminding us of the wonders of the cosmos.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's manager Michael O'Neill expressed "real sense of disappointment" following his team's 3-1 defeat against Germany, despite a proud display in Cologne. Serge Gnabry scored early for Germany, but Isaac Price equalized for Northern Ireland with a volley. However, two quick goals from Nadiem Amiri and Florian Wirtz secured Germany's much-needed first win in Group A. O'Neill lamented some defensive errors and a questionable free-kick call, acknowledging his side's lack of squad depth in managing back-to-back tough games. Northern Ireland now sits second in Group A, with crucial home games against Slovakia and Germany ahead in October, where they hope to secure better results.</p>
