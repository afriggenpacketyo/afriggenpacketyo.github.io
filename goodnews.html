          <p>Gold prices have surged in 2025, driven by inflation, geopolitical tensions, and central bank buying, leading to speculation about reaching $4,000 per ounce. Experts suggest that if gold maintains its current growth rate, this milestone could be achieved in 2025, with continued dollar devaluation being a key factor. Other analysts predict it could take one to two years, barring any major geopolitical events, emphasizing the importance of monitoring double-digit monthly or quarterly gains as a signal. Investment strategies include maintaining a long-term outlook, considering gold leasing, and investing in gold mining mutual funds, with experts advising to start investing now and use dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility.

          <p>The Trump Organization has announced the launch of T1 Phone by Trump Mobile, a cellular service costing $47.45 per month that includes unlimited calls, texts, and data. The company also plans to release a $499 phone manufactured in the U.S., coinciding with the 10-year anniversary of Donald Trump's first presidential run announcement. Eric Trump stated that this new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment, aiming to provide customer service by Americans for Americans. However, the new venture raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding potential conflicts with rival companies and the sourcing of foreign-made parts. </p>

          <p>The US Army showcased autonomous robotic dogs during the 250th anniversary parade in Washington, highlighting the military's pursuit of technological superiority in autonomous combat. These quadruped unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs) are being used by the US Marine Corps for patrol and reconnaissance, especially in dangerous missions like detecting explosives. China has also invested heavily in this technology, with the People‚Äôs Liberation Army deploying similar Q-UGVs in various operations.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates starting to fall, experts recommend opening accounts sooner rather than later, as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates further this year. Shopping around for the best rates is crucial, especially when existing CDs are nearing maturity, and smaller community banks and credit unions should be considered. Choosing short-term CDs can offer better rates, while longer-term CDs provide protection against future rate drops, and CD laddering can balance both. Understanding the risks, including early withdrawal penalties, is essential, and maintaining an emergency fund is advised to avoid breaking CD terms. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan has faced criticism regarding traffic diversion, impacts on bus routes, and the quality of retail offerings, but the mayor aims to rejuvenate Oxford Street and attract international visitors. Previous consultations showed varying levels of support from business owners, residents, and visitors, and the move has sparked debate over local democracy and the mayor's authority.</p>
