          <p>Disney has confirmed that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume its broadcast, ending an indefinite suspension that began last week. The network stated the initial decision to halt production was made to de-escalate a tense national situation following the host's controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, the company decided to bring the late-night show back, a move that follows widespread debate over free speech and corporate responses to political pressure.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against an offshore wind project, allowing Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm. The project, located off the coast of New England, is 80% complete and is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The judge ruled that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit, which argued the administration's order was unlawful and issued in bad faith, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced a framework deal intended to allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new ownership structure. The plan involves creating a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, with software company Oracle overseeing the security of the app's U.S. operations and algorithm. Although a senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed the agreement, leaving some uncertainty as the administration prepares to extend the deadline for the app's divestment.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates on a downward trend and the potential for another Federal Reserve rate cut in October, prospective homebuyers are advised to prepare strategically. Financial experts suggest that while waiting for more favorable rates, individuals should check their credit reports for inaccuracies and secure a mortgage pre-approval to demonstrate their seriousness to sellers. Additionally, researching experienced real estate agents and comparing lender terms and costs now can position buyers to act quickly and effectively in what may become a more competitive market.

          <p>In response to insurers pulling back from the California market, the consumer advocacy group Consumer Watchdog has proposed a ballot initiative called the "Insurance Policyholder Bill of Rights." The measure would compel insurance companies to offer coverage to homeowners who implement wildfire mitigation measures or face a five-year ban on selling any home or auto insurance in the state. This proposal comes as homeowners face soaring rates and non-renewals, aiming to give them more power and protection in a volatile insurance landscape.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $100,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A 10-year loan at current rates would cost approximately $1,236 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $974 per month, both marginally lower than costs earlier in the year. While the decrease is not substantial, further anticipated rate cuts could make borrowing against record-high home equity levels an increasingly attractive option for those needing access to a large sum of cash.

          <p>For 2025, the average monthly premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, can vary widely, typically ranging from $90 to $300 for popular mid-level plans.

To secure lower premiums, experts advise enrolling as soon as eligible, comparing different insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing if one's health needs are minimal.
