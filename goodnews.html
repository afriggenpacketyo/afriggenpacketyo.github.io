          <p>Jen Pawol has officially broken a significant barrier in professional sports, becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball regular-season game. Her historic debut took place during the first game of a doubleheader between the Atlanta Braves and Miami Marlins, where she served as the first base umpire. The 48-year-old, who has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016, was met with a warm ovation from the crowd and support from players and managers. Following the game, Pawol donated the cap she wore during her debut to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate the milestone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for functional beverages, which promise benefits like relaxation and stress relief, is facing questions about the validity of its health claims. While brands like Trip advertise ingredients such as L-theanine and Lion's Mane mushroom to promote a sense of calm, nutritionists and dietitians are skeptical. Experts point out that the quantities of these supplements in the drinks are often far lower than the amounts used in clinical studies, making significant effects unlikely. Psychologists suggest that any perceived calming effect may be a placebo, stemming from the ritual of taking a moment for oneself with a special beverage rather than the ingredients themselves.</p>

Despite the decline of print media and the rise of digital news drastically reducing his sales, Akbar continues his work for the freedom and joy it brings.

          <p>A dog named Petunia has been crowned the winner of this year's "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of dogs regardless of their pedigree. Petunia and her owner, Shannon Nyman, received a $5,000 prize for the victory. The contest aims to promote a positive message about animal adoption, as many of the participating dogs have been rescued from shelters and puppy mills. It serves as a lighthearted showcase of pageantry and pride for pets that might not fit conventional standards of beauty.</p>

          <p>A recent statement by singer Ed Sheeran, who was born and raised in England, describing himself as "culturally Irish" has ignited a debate about the nature of identity in 2025. Sheeran, who has Irish grandparents and an Irish parent, defended his connection to the country, but his comments drew some criticism online. This article explores the evolving and complex definitions of Irishness, which can encompass heritage, cultural immersion, and personal feeling, rather than just place of birth. The discussion touches upon the blended identities common in the UK, the nuances within Northern Ireland, and the historical cross-fertilization of cultures between the two islands.</p>

          <p>The recent release of a new "War of the Worlds" adaptation, starring Ice Cube, has been so widely panned by critics that it has sparked a conversation about the appeal of truly terrible films. Initially scoring 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie's terrible reviews paradoxically made many people eager to watch it, highlighting the phenomenon of "so bad they're good" cinema. Film enthusiasts and critics argue that an earnestly made but failed movie can be more entertaining and memorable than a bland, forgettable blockbuster. Such films often build cult followings precisely because of their enjoyable incompetence, flawed execution, and unintentional humor.</p>

          <p>Six months after its release, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek continues to influence the tech industry, despite fading from headlines. The app's sudden popularity and claims of rivaling ChatGPT at a fraction of the development cost initially shocked Silicon Valley, wiping billions from Nvidia's market value. DeepSeek challenged the prevailing "bigger is better" philosophy for AI development, proving that capable models could be built with smarter, more efficient engineering. While many U.S. companies banned its use over data security concerns, some startups continue to use it to cut costs, highlighting the ongoing tension between innovation, cost-effectiveness, and the U.S.-China tech rivalry.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas are facing accusations of cultural appropriation from authorities in Oaxaca, Mexico. The controversy surrounds a new sandal design that bears the state's name and reinterprets a traditional huarache sandal unique to the region. The Mexican government is seeking compensation, and local officials have demanded the model be withdrawn. Chavarria has issued a statement of regret, acknowledging the design should have been developed in partnership with the Oaxacan community. This incident is the latest in a series of disputes where Mexico has challenged global fashion brands for using Indigenous designs without permission or compensation.</p>

          <p>Apple shares experienced their best week in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The significant gain followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. In response, President Trump stated that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, a move that eased investor concerns about the company's profitability. The successful meeting, combined with strong quarterly earnings reported two weeks prior, propelled Apple's stock to a closing price of $229.35 per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The chief financial officer for Wilton, Connecticut, has resigned after town officials discovered she was simultaneously employed as the town administrator for Greybull, Wyoming, a town 2,000 miles away. Wilton officials claim they were unaware of Dawn Norton's second, $210,000-a-year job and that it would not have been approved. However, Norton contends that she had been working remotely for Wilton while on family medical leave and had kept town leadership fully informed of her new role. The discovery came amid a review of Wilton's Finance Department, which had been facing issues including understaffing and audit findings of "material weakness."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist suggests that pomegranates are a highly beneficial fruit for people over 50 seeking to support healthy brain aging. Rich in polyphenols, pomegranates provide powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these properties may also help protect the brain from amyloid proteins, which are associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and are not available year-round, pomegranate extract can be an alternative, though consumers should choose versions without added sugars. The article also notes that other fruits like blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados offer significant cognitive benefits.</p>
