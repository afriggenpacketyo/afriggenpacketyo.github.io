          <p>An Adobe Analytics report projects that U.S. online holiday spending will increase by 5.3% to $253.4 billion, a noticeable slowdown from the 8.7% growth seen in the previous year and below the 10-year average. This moderated growth reflects broader economic concerns, with consumers, particularly Gen Z, planning to spend less and actively seeking discounts. Despite the slowdown, mobile shopping is expected to account for over half of all online sales, and the use of AI-powered chatbots for gift research is anticipated to rise significantly.

          <p>OpenAI has entered into a major partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which could result in OpenAI acquiring a 10% stake in the chipmaker. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over several years, starting in 2026, positioning AMD as a key strategic supplier and reducing OpenAI's reliance on Nvidia. As part of the agreement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares, contingent on deployment milestones. This move, which caused AMD's stock to surge over 30%, highlights the increasingly interconnected corporate economy of the AI industry.</p>

Their collective work identified a crucial mechanism that prevents the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues, which can lead to autoimmune diseases. Dr. Sakaguchi discovered a key subtype of T cells, known as regulatory T-cells, while Brunkow and Ramsdell identified the Foxp3 gene that controls their development. These findings have opened a new field of immunology and are guiding the development of new treatments for autoimmune disorders and cancer.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are providing a valuable savings option, with top accounts offering returns higher than the current inflation rate. While national averages for one-year CDs are around 1.99% APY, competitive online banks are offering significantly higher rates, such as 4.45% APY for a six-month term. Experts suggest that savers look to online banks for the best rates and consider short-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve has made them more lucrative than long-term options.

The drama follows a modern-day Chicago teen who finds himself transported back to 1864, exploring themes of history, identity, and the search for freedom.

          <p>In her new book, "Into the Weeds," acclaimed author Lydia Davis explores the symbiotic relationship between reading and writing, framing it not as a one-way street but as a continuous conversation. Adapted from a lecture, the work functions less as a traditional writing manual and more as a guide to rediscovering literature through personal and sometimes serendipitous connections. Davis shares her own reading journey, moving between diverse authors and reflecting on how books find us through recommendations and unexpected discoveries. The article suggests this approach is vital in an era of shrinking literary criticism and algorithm-driven suggestions.</p>
