          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a semi-final spot in the 2025 World Cup by defeating co-hosts India in a thrilling four-run victory in Indore. This win is considered the most significant of the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt era, showcasing the team's improved ability to perform under pressure. Despite initial struggles against India's strong batting partnership, England capitalized on a key dismissal and maintained composure to close out the game. The team's performance, particularly Heather Knight's century, demonstrated a positive shift in their approach, setting them up for upcoming challenges.</p>

The squad includes former England Under-20s captain Emeka Ilione and 19-year-old wing Noah Caluori, indicating a focus on new talent.

          <p>A United Airlines flight traveling from Denver to Los Angeles was diverted to Salt Lake City last week after pilots identified a crack in one of the multi-layer windshield's panes. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, and the Boeing 737's windshield is being sent to a laboratory for examination. The windshield is designed to remain functional even if one layer is damaged, and all 134 passengers and six crew members landed safely. NTSB will determine if an object struck the windshield, but many staff are furloughed due to a government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The job advertisement for the new British ambassador to the US explicitly warns candidates against using artificial intelligence in their applications, stating that AI-generated content will be considered "plagiarism." This guidance, linked to Civil Service application rules, emphasizes authenticity and honesty, and prohibits AI use during live assessments. The £155,000-£174,000 role requires excellent networking skills and strong political judgment. The warning comes as nearly one-third of jobseekers reportedly use AI for applications, highlighting evolving concerns about AI's role in professional recruitment processes.</p>

          <p>Rangers' plans to appoint Kevin Muscat as their next head coach have collapsed due to his ongoing commitment to Chinese side Shanghai Port, who are still in contention for their league title. The potential delay in his start date made the deal unworkable for both parties. This development follows former Rangers boss Steven Gerrard's rejection of a return and Danny Rohl's withdrawal from consideration. The club is now confident of making an appointment in the coming days, as they seek to recover from a dreadful start to the season under former manager Russell Martin.</p>

Rookie Konata Mumpfield and Terrance Ferguson also contributed touchdowns. The Jaguars struggled with penalties and sacks, while Rams' edge rusher Byron Young extended his sack streak.

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter, hosting and performing on Saturday Night Live, used her appearance to subtly address criticism regarding her provocative public persona and album visuals. In a QVC spoof, she played a designer seemingly oblivious to the phallic resemblance of her neck pillow, mirroring her winking innocence. Her opening monologue directly referenced the "Man's Best Friend" album cover controversy with feigned bewilderment. A later sketch, where her "girlboss" character questioned if criticism stemmed from internalized misogyny, further underscored her intent to challenge perceptions and be "in on the joke" about her sexuality.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer shares ten key takeaways from his recent trip to San Francisco, focusing on AI, tech companies, and broader market trends. He notes Salesforce's AI platform is effectively streamlining businesses without cutting legacy software, leading to raised revenue projections. Cramer expresses concern over OpenAI's shift towards consumer products, but highlights Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's strong belief in their partnership. He advises against zero-sum thinking for AI chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia, and suggests selling nuclear and quantum stocks due to lack of commercial readiness. He also recommends Dell if its stock drops, praises Levi Strauss's growth, and observes San Francisco's nascent recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic per capita decline in smoking prevalence over the past two decades, dropping from 54% to 23%, attributed to strong public health policies like taxation and advertising bans. However, a Lancet study indicates the absolute number of smokers has risen by 63% due to population growth. Indonesia remains a notable exception, with high male tobacco use and industry influence leading to a scrapped tax hike. The region also faces the new challenge of rising e-cigarette use, with several countries implementing bans to prevent youth vaping and avoid creating a new generation of nicotine users.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume canceling student debt under specific income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, reopening a path to forgiveness for millions of borrowers. This agreement, reached with the American Federation of Teachers, clarifies that the Education Department will process forgiveness for eligible borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. The administration had previously paused forgiveness under some IDR plans, citing court orders related to the SAVE plan. The agreement also confirms that borrowers eligible for forgiveness in 2025 will not owe federal taxes on the relief.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is exploring the possibility of cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, a move that could save average households £86 annually. This consideration comes amid a persistent cost-of-living crisis and follows a recent 2% increase in energy regulator Ofgem's price cap. While Miliband emphasized long-term solutions like clean power, he confirmed the government is examining all options ahead of November's Budget. The debate also includes potentially funding "green levies" through taxes rather than adding them to energy bills.</p>

          <p>Green Party leader Zack Polanski defended his party's proposals for an annual wealth tax on assets above £10 million and £1 billion, arguing it is crucial for "tackling the deep inequality in our society." Polanski estimates such a tax could raise £15bn to £25bn annually, though critics warn it could penalize investment and encourage the wealthy to leave the country. He also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, emphasizing that the focus should be on the wealthiest to contribute more. Polanski's "eco-populism" platform has seen a surge in Green Party membership, now reportedly surpassing the Conservatives.</p>
