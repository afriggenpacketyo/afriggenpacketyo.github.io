          <p>U.S. Senator Ted Cruz has officially endorsed Representative Chip Roy for Texas Attorney General, aiming to succeed Ken Paxton who is running for the U.S. Senate. Cruz praised Roy, his former chief of staff, as a "battle-tested warrior" and the best-equipped candidate to defend conservative values and the Constitution in the state. Roy is one of several Republican candidates in the race, but Cruz's endorsement highlights their long-standing political alliance and shared conservative principles. The endorsement positions Roy as a prominent contender in the upcoming election to become the state's top law enforcement officer.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has dismissed claims that Chinese ownership of American farmland constitutes a national security threat. Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03% of total U.S. farmland, arguing the amount is too insignificant to impact food security. He characterized efforts to restrict such purchases as unfounded political manipulation disguised as national security concerns. The ambassador emphasized that these actions are intended to undermine agricultural cooperation between the two nations for narrow political agendas.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers lost their preseason finale to the San Francisco 49ers 30-23 in a game marked by numerous mistakes from the backup players. Coach Jim Harbaugh expressed disappointment over the high number of turnovers and penalties, which contrasted with the team's cleaner performances earlier in the preseason. Despite the sloppy play, some individuals stood out, such as undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax, who made several key defensive plays, potentially securing a spot on the 53-man roster. The game served as a final, and for some, troubling, audition before Tuesday's roster cuts.</p>

          <p>The star-studded cast of the film adaptation of 'The Thursday Murder Club,' including Pierce Brosnan and Dame Helen Mirren, has spoken about the pressure of meeting fan expectations. Brosnan admitted to feeling a "huge responsibility" to the millions of readers of Richard Osman's bestselling book series. The film, directed by Chris Columbus and produced by Steven Spielberg's company, brings together Brosnan, Mirren, Sir Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie as a group of retirement village residents who solve murders. The actors shared their positive on-set experiences and camaraderie, hoping their chemistry translates well to the screen for the awaiting audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The winning numbers have been drawn for Saturday's Powerball jackpot, which reached an estimated $700 million, the largest of the year so far. The selected numbers were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, with the red Powerball being 18. The jackpot grew to its substantial size after 36 consecutive drawings without a grand prize winner since May 31. A potential winner can choose between receiving the full amount in annual installments over 29 years or a lump-sum cash payment of $316.3 million before taxes. The drawing has generated significant public interest across the 45 participating states.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were defeated by the San Diego Padres 5-1, managing only two hits and falling out of first place in the National League West. For the second night in a row, a Padres starting pitcher unexpectedly dominated the Dodgers' lineup, with Nestor Cortes retiring the first 16 batters he faced. In contrast, Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow struggled, giving up three runs in the fourth inning and putting the game out of reach. The loss shifts the division lead to the Padres by one game, highlighting the Dodgers' recent offensive slump during a critical series.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to overhaul the asylum appeals system in an effort to reduce delays and cut the number of migrants housed in taxpayer-funded hotels. A new independent body staffed by adjudicators will be created to hear cases more quickly, as the current average wait time for an appeal is over a year. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the plan aims to end unacceptable delays for the 51,000 cases currently awaiting a decision. The move comes amid increasing political pressure and public frustration over the use of hotels for asylum seekers, which ministers have pledged to end.</p>

          <p>A new study from the Pew Research Center indicates that the immigrant population in the United States has decreased by over one million people since Donald Trump began his second term in January. The research found that the number of immigrants dropped from a record 53.3 million in January to 51.9 million by June. Consequently, the share of immigrants among all U.S. residents fell from a recent high of 15.8% to 15.4%. The study also noted a corresponding decline in the labor force, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving, reflecting a significant demographic shift under the current administration's policies.</p>

          <p>The charity Disabled Motoring UK is advocating for all airports in the United Kingdom to eliminate drop-off charges for blue badge holders. While many airports offer discounts or exemptions, the system is described as inconsistent and complex, creating barriers for disabled travelers. An investigation found that policies vary widely, with some airports like London City offering free drop-offs for all, while others require pre-registration or have separate, less convenient free zones. The charity argues that these fees are unfair and that disabled customers should be treated with dignity rather than being financially penalized upon arrival.</p>

          <p>Three previously unknown paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich, potentially worth over £100 million, are facing scrutiny over their authenticity. The works, now on display in a Bucharest museum, were allegedly discovered under a pensioner's mattress in Israel. However, leading art scholar Konstantin Akinsha has raised serious doubts, stating the paintings were never documented during the artist's lifetime and that their origin story is problematic. The certificates of authenticity presented by the owner have also been linked to an art historian who has previously authenticated disputed works, leaving the art world skeptical.</p>

However, the team struggled in the second half, committing numerous costly penalties and allowing Aquinas to close the gap.

New York City was the only U.S. city to make the top 10, landing at number four due to its walkability, food, and culture, though it scored poorly on affordability.

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its 10th anniversary, its actual impact on policy remains a subject of debate. While the platform allows the public to directly engage with Parliament, with petitions over 100,000 signatures considered for debate, many feel the government responses are often dismissive. One notable success was Finn's Law, which increased protections for police service animals following a popular petition. However, the largest petitions, such as those calling to reverse Brexit, failed to change government policy, leading some to view the system as an illusion of influence rather than a genuine tool for change.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in their early 20s are turning to anti-wrinkle injections, or "preventative Botox," to stop lines from forming before they become permanent. Proponents, including some medical professionals, argue that starting early can relax facial muscles, reduce skin creasing, and potentially negate the need for more invasive procedures later in life. However, other experts are skeptical, warning that it is a waste of money to treat wrinkles that do not yet exist and cautioning against the societal pressure to pursue anti-aging treatments at such a young age. The long-term effects of starting these treatments early remain largely unstudied.</p>
