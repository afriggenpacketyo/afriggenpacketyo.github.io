          <h2>Democrat Suggests Work Visas for Illegal Immigrants Instead of Self-Deportation Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 06:35:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the Trump administration's offer of $1,000 to illegal immigrants who self-deport, Senator Ruben Gallego proposed a system where immigrants would pay a $5,000 fine, undergo a background check, and receive a renewable work visa. This proposal aims to make immigrants financially responsible for their immigration process, similar to existing procedures for other immigrants. The Trump administration's self-deportation initiative, utilizing the CBP Home App, seeks to reduce deportation costs, which currently average $17,121 per individual. The Department of Homeland Security claims that this approach is a more cost-effective and dignified way for migrants to leave the United States.</p>

          <p>While overall inflation remains a concern, some sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing price declines, offering consumers relief in areas such as airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Decreased oil prices have contributed to lower gasoline costs, while seasonal factors and reduced transportation expenses have driven down produce prices. Consumer electronics, like TVs and smartphones, continue to see price deflation due to improved production efficiencies and technological advancements. Economists caution that these lower prices may not last, as tariffs and other factors could soon reverse the trend.</p>

          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, is still "six to eight months behind where US frontier companies are," despite recent hype. Clark acknowledged that DeepSeek's technology includes "clever algorithmic ideas" but implied that it lacks the resources of its American counterparts. He also stated that DeepSeek's progress should be monitored, but that its models do not currently pose a national security risk. Clark's remarks come amidst speculation about the release of DeepSeek's next-generation models and the ongoing competition in the AI industry.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Proposed Baby Bonus Unlikely to Boost Birthrates, Experts Say</h2>

          <p>President Trump's plan to offer $5,000 "baby bonuses" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to be effective, according to experts. While the U.S. is experiencing declining birthrates, demographers argue that a single payment would not address the larger financial challenges of raising a family, including unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, and inaccessible childcare. Experts suggest that more substantial policy changes, such as childcare subsidies, accessible healthcare, and guaranteed paid family leave, are needed to create conditions that support families and encourage them to have children.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information, like weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, yet only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science funding. The poll highlights a disconnect between the public's reliance on federal data and their awareness of its source. While political polarization has grown around trust in science, the poll suggests bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity. The poll was conducted by the Association of Science and Technology Centers.</p>

          <p>Southern California officials are using sterile male Aedes mosquitoes to combat the spread of dengue fever, with promising early results. Vector control districts have released thousands of these non-biting, sterilized males in select neighborhoods, leading to significant reductions in the invasive mosquito population. In one area, the mosquito population decreased by nearly 82% compared to a control area. Despite these successes, challenges remain in scaling the intervention to larger regions, and officials are seeking additional funding to expand the program. Climate change and the spread of Aedes mosquitoes have increased the risk of local dengue transmission.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have become a target of the right, both sides often misunderstand the true purpose of DEI. The author contends that DEI is not about suppressing free speech or limiting meritocracy, but about improving communication and creating a more equitable environment for all. They point out that DEI trainings can provide valuable insight into the impact of language and actions on people from different backgrounds. The piece also criticizes the left for engaging in heavy-handed virtue-signaling that demonizes people's flaws and blindspots, providing no room for grace.</p>
