          <p>A SkyWest pilot executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a potential collision with a B-52 military bomber during landing approach in Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that the bomber was not announced by the control tower, which lacks radar, catching him completely by surprise. The Air Force confirmed the B-52 was conducting a pre-approved flyover for a local event and stated the tower did not advise its crew of the inbound commercial flight. The FAA is now investigating the incident, which involved a privately run air traffic control tower.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Encourage Economic Liberalization Abroad</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that former President Trump's widespread tariffs, while widely criticized, have an unintended positive effect by exposing and prompting other nations to address their own self-defeating internal trade barriers. Countries like Canada and China have reportedly made significant moves to remove domestic commerce restrictions in response to the tariff pressure. The piece suggests that the European Union could also benefit by breaking down internal barriers, though its focus may be shifting toward a war economy instead of trade liberalization.

          <p>Thomas Fugate, a 22-year-old special assistant at the Department of Homeland Security, has addressed criticism regarding his age and alleged inexperience. Contrary to some reports, both Fugate and the DHS clarified that he was not the head of the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3), but rather a "low-level" staffer in a downsized office focused on grant administration. DHS leadership defended Fugate, suggesting the controversy is a smokescreen to distract from waste within the CP3 program under the previous administration. Fugate stated all major decisions were made by senior policy leadership.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit organization in Connecticut is helping to restore the marine ecosystem of the Long Island Sound by returning used oyster shells to the water. The group, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects discarded shells from over 50 local restaurants. These shells provide a critical surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter water, prevent erosion, and create habitats for other species. After a year-long curing process to eliminate contaminants, the shells are deposited back into the sound, helping to replenish oyster beds that have been overfished for generations.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase (dubbed "PARC")—that he believes will maintain their upward momentum, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies are part of a "two-track market" where certain trendy names are relentlessly pursued by individual buyers, often regardless of traditional metrics. While Cramer acknowledged these stocks are volatile, he suggested they have solid enough fundamentals to distinguish them from more speculative plays. He advised investors to exercise discipline by taking profits on significant gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seating set to begin on flights starting January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights beginning this July, choosing from various fare bundles that include options like extra legroom seats. The airline is also overhauling its boarding process, replacing the current A-C group letters with a numerical system from 1 to 8 based on seat location and loyalty status. This move, along with the recent elimination of its "bags fly free" policy, signals a significant shift in the carrier's business model.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of the 700 active-duty U.S. marines that were deployed to Los Angeles last month by the Trump administration. The deployment, which was opposed by local and state leaders as unnecessary and provocative, was intended to protect federal property during protests against immigration enforcement sweeps. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the marines were being redeployed now that "stability" has returned to the city. L.A. Mayor Karen Bass reiterated her view that the deployment was an "inappropriate misuse of our troops," and the withdrawal follows that of 2,000 National Guard troops last week.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a significant foreign policy shift as President Javier Milei seeks to rebalance his international relationships. Effective immediately, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This policy change is seen as an overture to Beijing and comes at a time of delayed trade negotiations with the U.S. and growing American unease over Argentina's increasingly warm ties with China, highlighting the delicate diplomatic position the South American nation is navigating.</p>
