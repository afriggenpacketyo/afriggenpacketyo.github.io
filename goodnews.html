          <p>President Trump has nominated Emil Bove, a Justice Department official and his former defense attorney, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Trump praised Bove as smart, tough, and respected, stating he will end the "Weaponization of Justice" and restore the Rule of Law. Bove's nomination is controversial as it comes amidst Trump's attacks on "activist" judges.

          <p>Ricky Sawyer, a self-styled "beauty consultant" specializing in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs), has been banned from carrying out cosmetic surgery in England and Wales. This ban follows a BBC investigation that revealed Sawyer was performing risky BBL treatments, injecting large amounts of dermal filler into clients' buttocks. The investigation presented evidence, including video footage and injury photos, to the Manchester Civil Justice Centre. The judge granted an injunction against Sawyer, prohibiting him from performing invasive cosmetic procedures and possessing related surgical equipment or antibiotics until May 2028, with a power of arrest attached to the order.</p>

          <p>The reality comedy "Duck Dynasty" is being revived on A&E, reflecting a shift back to conservative identity politics. The show, which originally aired during the Obama era, focused on the Robertson family and their traditionalist, Christian lifestyle. It became a precursor to the culture wars, with a controversy over Phil Robertson's comments on homosexuality and race. The revival comes as the family navigates celebrity, generational change, and the business of being the Robertsons, in an environment where MAGA-coded media is more prevalent.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise recent college graduates to begin saving for retirement immediately to take advantage of compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite potential budget constraints, setting up a routine of investing early is crucial for securing long-term financial stability.

Carney stated it is "not smart" for Canada to be so reliant on the US for defence, with 75 cents of every Canadian dollar of capital spending going to the United States. Canada's defence minister also emphasized the need to boost defence capacity amidst growing global threats. This move aligns with NATO's call for members to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP.</p>
