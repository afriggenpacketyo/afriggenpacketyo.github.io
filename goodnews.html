          <p>A dump truck crashed into the back of the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, colliding with five vehicles and knocking out power to surrounding businesses. The incident occurred when the truck lost control, bringing down a main wire and initially affecting over 1,400 customers, though power was rerouted to reduce the impact to 225 customers. Authorities reported no injuries, and crews are working to restore power, however the incident occurred shortly before bands were scheduled to play at the venue, and a representative for the venue could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

          <p>Elton John, Dua Lipa, and over 400 British artists are urging the Prime Minister to support an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill, requiring AI developers to be transparent about using copyrighted material to train AI models. The artists argue that failing to protect their work would mean "giving away" their creations to tech firms and would threaten the UK's creative industries. The government says it is consulting on measures to balance the needs of creative industries and AI companies, while some argue that restrictive copyright laws could hamper the UK's growth and innovation.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft was stranded in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur and because the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield to survive Venus' atmosphere, there is a chance it will partially survive its return to earth, though the exact landing location remains unknown.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced a statewide quarantine on non-commercially harvested mussels due to the risk of naturally occurring toxins, such as paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid. The quarantine, effective through October 31, warns against eating sport-harvested mussels along the California coastline because biotoxins accumulate in shellfish during algae blooms, making them poisonous to humans. While commercial mussels are tested and safe to eat, officials advise caution with clams and scallops, recommending the removal of digestive organs before consumption.</p>
