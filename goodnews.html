          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is scheduled to return to the field for the team's final preseason game after recovering from an oblique injury. Head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed that, barring any setbacks, Sanders will see action against the Los Angeles Rams. He is expected to play in the third quarter, following starter Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. This game will mark the first time both of the Browns' rookie quarterbacks have played in the same preseason contest.</p>

The proposed amendment, drafted by top regulatory bodies, aims to tighten regulations on pricing to foster a more stable and sustainable market equilibrium for businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeast into the Atlantic Ocean, away from the North Carolina coastline. Although the storm is not projected to make landfall in the United States, it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks and continues to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along much of the East Coast. Officials have maintained storm surge warnings and evacuation orders for parts of North Carolina, urging the public to exercise extreme caution near the ocean.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is becoming a popular method for wealthy investors to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The technique involves exchanging a portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before its public launch, thereby postponing the tax liability until the ETF shares are eventually sold. While the strategy offers significant tax advantages, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can limit an investor's liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent shift in market behavior suggests that investors are rethinking how potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will affect different stock sectors. Contrary to the traditional view that lower rates boost high-growth tech stocks, a recent market rotation saw investors selling these stocks to purchase value-oriented, cyclical names. This trend indicates a greater focus on which companies stand to benefit from immediate upward earnings revisions due to lower rates, rather than just the valuation models of tech companies.

          <p>Newly obtained public records show that community protests targeting federal immigration agents housed in Los Angeles hotels this summer prompted the U.S. military to compile a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." Activists organized demonstrations, including some called "No sleep for Ice," to pressure hotels into removing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents. The documents suggest these grassroots efforts were effective in disrupting the administration's immigration operations by complicating lodging for federal personnel.</p>
