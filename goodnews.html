          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a long-running lawsuit filed by the families of 9/11 victims. The ruling allows the families to proceed with their case, which alleges that the Saudi government provided material support to some of the hijackers. The lawsuit, strengthened by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, focuses on alleged connections between Saudi officials and two of the hijackers who settled in California before the attacks. The judge found that the plaintiffs provided reasonable evidence of these connections, overcoming the kingdom's claims of coincidence and innocent assistance.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded three-time All-Pro linebacker Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers in a major move that alters the competitive balance in the NFC. As part of the deal, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The trade follows a period of growing tension between Parsons and the Cowboys, during which he had not fully practiced and had formally requested a trade. The acquisition provides a significant boost to the Packers' defense.</p>

          <p>Meme del Real, a key member of the iconic Mexican rock band Café Tacvba, is releasing his first solo album after a period of introspection and creative exploration. In a recent interview, he described how the songs for the new project "arrived" organically while he was living in solitude outside Mexico City, rather than being intentionally sought. The album reportedly features a playful mix of genres, from electronic love songs to futuristic boleros, reflecting his diverse musical upbringing. Del Real explained that the process was a transformative, instinct-driven experience that he felt compelled to pursue at this moment in his career.</p>

          <p>Best Buy exceeded Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for its second quarter, reporting a 1.6% rise in comparable sales, its highest growth in three years. The positive results were driven by strong sales in computing, mobile phones, and video gaming, including the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Despite the improved performance, the consumer electronics retailer maintained its full-year forecast, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and its business. CEO Corie Barry noted that while the company is trending toward the higher end of its sales range, it is prudent to remain cautious. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As rising costs put financial pressure on seniors, many face gaps in their Medicare coverage for expenses like copays and deductibles. This article outlines several financial strategies to address these shortfalls and ensure full healthcare coverage. One primary option is Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to pay for out-of-pocket costs not covered by original Medicare. Other potential solutions for homeowners aged 62 and older include reverse mortgages, which provide income from home equity without requiring immediate repayment, and annuities, which can guarantee a future stream of income.</p>

          <p>Intel's Chief Financial Officer, David Zinsner, has confirmed the company received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government as part of a deal for the White House to take a 10% stake in the semiconductor firm.

In addition to the government investment, Zinsner also indicated that Intel may seek outside investors for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, to help fund its growth.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing 23-year-old German international striker Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart. The deal is expected to be a club-record fee, surpassing the £63 million paid for Alexander Isak. Woltemade's arrival could potentially pave the way for Isak's long-rumored transfer to Liverpool, as Newcastle had previously stated they would need to secure two quality strikers before considering a sale. Woltemade had a breakout season with Stuttgart, scoring 17 goals, and was the top scorer at the recent Under-21 European Championship, drawing comparisons to a "two-metre Messi."</p>

          <p>Average interest rates for home equity loans have dropped to their lowest level in 2025, reaching 8.22% and making them a more competitive borrowing option. With U.S. homeowners' collective equity hitting a record high of nearly $18 trillion, many have substantial funds they can tap into. These loans offer a fixed interest rate, providing protection against future market volatility compared to variable-rate HELOCs. Furthermore, the interest paid on a home equity loan may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for eligible home improvements, adding to its potential financial benefits for homeowners.

          <p>Amazon is expanding its grocery business by adding fresh and perishable items to its existing same-day delivery service for Prime members in over 1,000 cities. This move allows customers to order items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables and other goods for a single, combined delivery. The company is leveraging and retrofitting its network of same-day fulfillment hubs with temperature-controlled environments to handle the new offerings. While the expansion aims to increase convenience and compete with traditional grocers, analysts note that initial selection may be limited and the low-margin grocery business presents operational challenges.
