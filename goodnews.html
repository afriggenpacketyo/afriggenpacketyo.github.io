          <p>Israel's Prime Minister has ordered the military to cease offensive actions in Gaza, permitting only defensive measures, according to Israeli sources. This move aims to facilitate a hostage release deal based on a U.S.-proposed plan, which is now a top priority for Israel. The government is preparing to send a negotiating team, possibly to Cairo, to finalize the agreement. Meanwhile, Palestinian militant groups have expressed support for Hamas's constructive response to the ceasefire proposal, signaling a potential step towards de-escalation in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <p>England's World Cup-winning rugby player Ellie Kildunne has indicated she is open to exploring opportunities with the proposed new R360 league, although she remains focused on her current contract with Harlequins. Kildunne is reportedly a top target for the breakaway league, with rumors that several of her England teammates have already signed pre-contract agreements. While acknowledging the significant changes and investment coming into women's rugby, she stated that many details about the R360 league are still unknown.

          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a new theory that the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice was originally a tomb guardian from China's Tang dynasty. The study, published in *Antiquity*, combines stylistic analysis and lead isotope testing to argue the statue shares features with mythical Chinese beasts and was cast with copper from the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate it may have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo and later modified. However, this theory is being disputed by some scholars in China.</p>

          <p>A new film starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, titled 'The Smashing Machine,' chronicles the turbulent life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr. The article details Kerr's journey from being the world's top fighter in the late 1990s to his subsequent battle with opioid addiction, alcoholism, and the collapse of his career, much of which was captured in a 2002 documentary of the same name. After years of struggle, Kerr achieved sobriety and reconnected with Johnson, who had long been interested in telling his story. The resulting film, directed by Benny Safdie, has received critical acclaim, offering Kerr a second chance at public recognition.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A conservative nationalist and advocate of the "Abenomics" economic strategy, Takaichi's victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust amid rising prices. Her political agenda includes expansionary fiscal policy, which could concern investors due to Japan's large national debt. Her nationalistic stances, such as visiting the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, may also create friction with neighboring countries like China and South Korea.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States, all of which are over 14,000 feet, in just 31 days. The project, named "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the peaks and running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles across six states. The article portrays the effort not just as a physical feat but as an artistic expression, with Jornet choosing "the most aesthetic line" through the mountains. This latest challenge underscores his shift from competitive racing to pursuing audacious personal endurance projects that explore both physical limits and the beauty of wild landscapes.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025 is set to appear on the night of October 7th, marking the beginning of a series of three consecutive supermoons. Known as the Harvest Moon, it will be the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far because its orbit brings it closest to Earth, a point called the perigee. The term "supermoon" describes a full moon that appears up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon, named for its proximity to the autumn equinox, is the latest it has occurred since 1987.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests that a breakthrough in the Israel-Gaza conflict is imminent, crediting Donald Trump's diplomatic approach. After Hamas issued a response to his 20-point peace plan that fell short of full acceptance, Trump strategically framed it as an agreement and immediately called on Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza. This move has effectively cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and shifted the momentum towards peace, prioritizing the release of hostages. The author argues that Trump's pragmatic, deal-making style and desire for a foreign policy victory were key factors in this pivotal moment of the two-year conflict.</p>
