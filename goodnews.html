          <p>The 2025 American Music Awards took place in Las Vegas, hosted by Jennifer Lopez. Kendrick Lamar led the nominations with 10, while Post Malone had eight, and Billie Eilish, Chappell Roan, and Shaboozey each had seven. Taylor Swift, who holds the record for most AMA wins, received six nominations but did not attend the ceremony, disappointing fans who hoped for a new album announcement. Janet Jackson received the Icon Award, and Rod Stewart was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award, with performances by Lopez, Benson Boone, Gwen Stefani, and Stewart rounding out the night's festivities.</p>

          <p>Charles B. Rangel, who served as the dean of New York's congressional delegation and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel represented Harlem in Congress for 46 years, beginning in 1970 when he unseated Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and retired in 2016 after winning his 23rd term, becoming the ninth-longest continuously serving member of the House. He was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for the Senate from New York in 2000 and was a key figure in Harlem's Democratic old guard, remembered for his gregariousness and ability to forge alliances.</p>

          <p>The government is set to shift funding for apprenticeships in England to prioritize training opportunities for those under 21. This controversial plan will scrap funding for postgraduate apprenticeships, meaning employers will need to fully fund level 7 apprenticeships for those over 21. The aim is to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults, with an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK being used to fund 45,000 training places. Critics argue this move will harm public services, particularly the NHS, and limit professional opportunities for young people who do not attend university.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand the acoustics of spaceflight and mitigate noise disruptions. With the increasing frequency of rocket launches, especially SpaceX's Falcon 9, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is becoming a concern for communities. Researchers aim to address this issue before it becomes pervasive, focusing on understanding how sound waves travel and what people find acceptable, especially as SpaceX tests the larger and louder Starship rocket. The research seeks to inform ways to lessen disruptions without halting launches.</p>
