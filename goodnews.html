          <p>Following a week of escalating aerial attacks, President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran. The agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over. This announcement came after Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which was a response to the U.S. strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran. The U.S. military used B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs on Iranian nuclear sites, causing monumental damage according to Trump, though a full battle damage assessment is still pending.</p>

          <p>Florida's Operation Dragon Eye, a collaborative effort involving 20 agencies, has rescued dozens of critically missing children from child sexual assault operations. The operation, spearheaded by the U.S. Marshals Office and supported by the state Attorney General's Office, focused on locating 60 at-risk children and apprehending suspects involved in trafficking, drugs, and child endangerment. The rescued children, ranging in age from 9 to 17, received immediate medical and psychological support, with long-term care protocols implemented. Authorities arrested eight individuals on various charges, including human trafficking and drug-related offenses, with the investigation ongoing and additional charges possible. The operation underscores Florida's commitment to combating sex trafficking, which remains a significant problem in the state.</p>

          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel believes Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions with the U.S. He argues that closing the strait would harm Iran's own exports, as the country ships 1.7 million barrels a day through it. Braziel notes that the market appears to agree, as oil prices dropped on Monday. He also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could damage the U.S.'s reputation as a trustworthy energy supplier, potentially impacting future trade relations. This comes after the U.S. attack on Iran's key nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from ICE custody, has vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian human rights. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over three months, with the Trump administration arguing he posed a risk to U.S. foreign policy. In his first broadcast interview, Khalil refuted these claims and accused the administration of trying to silence him for his activism. He also spoke about the difficulties of being separated from his newborn son during his detention and reiterated that there is no place for antisemitism in the Palestinian movement. Despite the threat of potential re-detention, Khalil remains committed to speaking out against injustice.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" before launching missile strikes on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. He downplayed Iran's response as "very weak" and announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. Diplomatic sources suggest that the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance. This echoes Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where advance notice was also given. Trump urged both Iran and Israel to pursue peace and harmony, hinting at a potential deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar. President Trump downplayed the response as weak and claimed a ceasefire had been agreed upon, but neither Iran nor Israel have commented on the ceasefire. He expressed hope that Iran would now pursue peace in the region. This scenario suggests that Trump's risky maneuver might yield positive outcomes if further escalation is avoided and negotiations become possible. The situation echoes a similar event in 2020, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iran retaliated for the killing of Qasem Soleimani.</p>

Pilots receive training on sleep studies and nutritional education to understand how food impacts alertness and digestion during long flights. Retired Lt. Gen. Steve Basham recommends bland meals like turkey sandwiches on wheat bread without cheese to optimize digestion. The B-2's success hinges on human performance, requiring pilots to maintain focus during mid-air refuelings and manage fatigue.

          <p>China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, according to a top U.S. analyst. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its own interests. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. China's focus is on protecting its economic interests rather than policing global waterways. China relies heavily on Middle Eastern oil, with a significant portion coming from Iran.</p>
