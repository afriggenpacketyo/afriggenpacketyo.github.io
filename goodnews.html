          <p>The U.S. government has taken a 10% stake in Canadian mineral explorer Trilogy Metals, leading to a premarket share increase of nearly 200%. This partnership, involving a $35.6 million investment, is part of a White House initiative to develop domestic supplies of critical minerals like copper in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, signaling a renewed federal commitment to securing domestic supply chains for resources essential to energy, defense, and manufacturing.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have arrested 18 suspects and dismantled a major international criminal gang believed to be responsible for smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China annually. The investigation, triggered by a victim tracking their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, uncovered a sophisticated operation that may account for nearly half of all phones stolen in London. The operation highlights the growing problem of phone theft, driven by high demand for second-hand devices, which are reportedly sold for thousands of pounds in China.</p>

The market surge also follows the election of Sanae Takaichi as the new leader of Japan's ruling party, positioning her to potentially become the country's first female prime minister.

          <p>China has launched its first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to leverage seawater for natural cooling and reduce energy consumption. The facility consists of large, sealed data cabins submerged 35 meters deep, each capable of housing hundreds of servers. This innovative approach aims to lower operational costs compared to land-based centers by significantly cutting the energy needed for cooling, marking a key development in the region's push for new technologies in the blue economy.</p>

          <p>Stargazers can observe the first of three consecutive supermoons of 2025 on Tuesday night with the appearance of the full Harvest Moon. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon, the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, is occurring unusually late in October, offering a notable celestial event for those with clear skies.</p>

          <p>Shares of home-flipping company Opendoor Technologies have soared by 400% this year, with a significant portion of the gains occurring after a new CEO, Kaz Nejatian, was appointed.

Despite the market enthusiasm, Opendoor has yet to achieve annual profitability, and the success of this new AI-focused strategy remains uncertain, posing a significant risk for investors.

          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a 4% prediction in April, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target of around 5%. This revision comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and is attributed to effective government support and strong export performance, particularly to Southeast Asia and Europe. However, the bank anticipates growth will slow to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus measures fade and challenges like a real estate slump and weak consumer spending persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese automaker BYD has announced that its UK sales surged by 880% in September compared to the previous year, making Britain its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model. This growth is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, unlike the EU and the US, which have imposed significant levies. The success of cheaper models from brands like BYD has contributed to a record high for EV sales in the UK.</p>

Nineteen of the cat-sized mammals, sourced from Scottish populations, were released at undisclosed locations and are being tracked with radio collars to monitor their progress. Conservationists from the Two Moors Pine Marten Project hailed the release as a positive sign for nature restoration, as the native species plays a critical role in balancing woodland ecosystems from which they were previously driven by hunting and habitat loss.</p>
