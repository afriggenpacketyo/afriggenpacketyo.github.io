This privately funded institution aims to become a dynamic hub encouraging action for civil and human rights, racial justice, and democracy, consciously operating beyond potential political interference. New exhibits will cover post-Civil War Reconstruction, showing patterns of "Progress. Backlash. Progress," and feature Martin Luther King Jr.'s home office, emphasizing his human side. The center seeks to inspire hope and agency by focusing on human rights victories and the inspirational history of activism.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence commemorates the fifth anniversary of the Abraham Accords, attributing their success to the Trump administration's leadership in fostering peace between Israel, the UAE, and Bahrain. He highlights the accords' remarkable resilience, noting that diplomatic ties and trade continued even after the barbaric Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, defying predictions of collapse. Pence criticizes the current administration for its failure to expand these partnerships and strongly advocates for making Saudi Arabia's entry into the accords a top foreign policy priority. He believes that normalizing relations with Riyadh would usher in a new era of security, cooperation, and economic growth across the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A significant number of Congressional lawmakers, specifically 10 senators and 27 House members, have announced they will not seek reelection to their current seats in 2026, marking a record high. Of these, 15 plan to retire from public office entirely, while others are pursuing different political roles, such as state governorships or transitions from the House to the Senate. The trend shows more Republicans (27) departing than Democrats (10), reflecting a generational shift within the Democratic party and, for some Republicans, potential ideological clashes with former President Trump's political vision. These departures occur amidst slim GOP majorities and ongoing redistricting efforts in several states.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled for an unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom, where he will be hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle, a rare honor typically not extended to second-term US presidents. The visit, described as "truly historic," will feature elaborate royal protocol, including a carriage procession, a military parade, and a state banquet. Despite Trump's unpopularity in the UK, the British government views this as a strategic diplomatic move to influence him on key issues like support for Ukraine. The itinerary promises significant pomp and circumstance, alongside potential for scrutinized interactions and public protests, as seen in his previous visit.</p>

Stripe, Revolut, Monzo, Starling Bank, and Payhawk are identified as strong potential contenders, each having achieved high private valuations and some exploring secondary share sales to offer staff liquidity. While many CEOs are closely monitoring market conditions, these firms represent a robust pipeline of future IPOs aiming for continued growth and market presence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun is undertaking a visit to China to meet with his counterpart, Wang Yi, with a primary objective of discussing a potential visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Seoul. If Xi's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) leaders’ summit in October is confirmed, it would mark his first visit to South Korea since 2014, signaling a significant recalibration of bilateral relations. The election of South Korea’s President Lee Jae-myung has created an opportunity for Beijing and Seoul to improve ties, which had previously soured. The expected appointment of Roh Jae-heon as Seoul’s ambassador to Beijing further indicates efforts to balance diplomatic engagement between Washington and Beijing.</p>

          <p>The United States and United Kingdom are poised to sign significant nuclear power deals during President Donald Trump's state visit, aiming to usher in a "golden age" of nuclear energy. These multi-billion-pound agreements include plans by US nuclear group X-Energy and British Gas owner Centrica to construct up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, capable of powering 1.5 million homes and creating up to 2,500 jobs. Other deals focus on developing data centers powered by small modular reactors (SMRs) in Nottinghamshire. This transatlantic partnership, known as the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, seeks to accelerate reactor construction, unlock billions in private investment, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and Russian nuclear material by 2028.</p>

          <p>Experts previously fired by the Trump administration from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have independently relaunched the climate.gov website under a new domain, climate.us. This initiative aims to restore and provide public access to critical climate information that was purged or distorted by the administration, which significantly cut funding for renewable energy and dismantled agencies producing climate data. The new, independent platform seeks to counteract political interference and ensure the integrity of climate science, including previously removed content related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This proactive effort underscores growing concerns that restricting climate data hinders the nation's ability to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>China's $12.7 trillion stock market rally appears poised for continued growth as household savings increasingly shift into equities, according to recent data from the central bank. Deposits at non-banking financial institutions saw significant increases in both July and August, indicating a robust rotation of capital towards the stock market. Analysts suggest that the prevailing low-interest-rate policies are diminishing returns from traditional bank deposits, prompting investors to seek more lucrative opportunities in stocks. The earnings yield of China's largest listed companies, currently at 5.5%, is notably more attractive than government bonds or demand deposit interest rates, actively fueling this investment trend (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China is actively exploring a strategic initiative, dubbed "Coal-to-Nuclear" (C2N), which proposes converting existing coal-fired power plants into advanced nuclear facilities. This innovative proposal, put forth by China Energy Engineering Group Co (CEEC), the nation’s leading state-owned energy infrastructure builder, aims to achieve direct decarbonization while efficiently preserving valuable infrastructure. The plan specifically involves utilizing fourth-generation reactors, which are anticipated to meet stringent site safety requirements more easily and secure greater public acceptance. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal capacity expected to reach retirement by 2030, this initiative offers a significant pathway to transitioning towards cleaner energy sources and reducing carbon emissions.</p>
