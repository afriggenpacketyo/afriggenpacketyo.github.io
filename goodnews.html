          <p>AMD reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, with overall sales surging by 36%, driven by strong performance in its data center segment, which includes Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs. The company's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted the increasing demand for AI GPUs as a key growth driver, with AI GPU sales reaching $5 billion in fiscal 2024. While gaming sales declined due to lower console chip revenue, client revenue for laptop and PC chips saw substantial growth, fueled by the release of Zen 5 chips. AMD's forecast for the current quarter remains strong, despite facing $800 million in costs due to U.S. export restrictions on some AI chips.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive reported better-than-expected first-quarter results but adjusted its 2025 delivery targets downward and increased its capital spending forecast, citing concerns about the global trade environment and potential impacts from President Trump's tariffs. Despite producing vehicles in the U.S., Rivian acknowledged vulnerability to global economic uncertainties, particularly evolving trade regulations. The company reaffirmed its plan to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year, bolstered by a $1 billion investment from Volkswagen Group as part of their joint venture focused on EV technology. Rivian's liquidity remains strong, with $8.5 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting Wednesday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will enforce Real ID requirements, meaning that standard state-issued driver's licenses may no longer be sufficient for boarding flights. While travelers without a Real ID may face additional screening, they will still be allowed to fly if they can provide alternative forms of identification, such as a U.S. passport or a Department of Homeland Security trusted traveler card. The TSA advises travelers without a compliant ID to arrive at least three hours before their domestic flight to allow time for identity verification and additional screening. The agency aims to minimize disruptions and ensure passengers can continue their travel plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of California legislators has issued a letter urging the state's congressional delegation to protect the Head Start program from proposed cuts by the Trump administration. The letter, signed by a majority of state lawmakers, expresses deep concern over potential reductions to the federal early childhood program, which provides child care, education, and medical services to over 80,000 low-income children in California. Legislators emphasized the importance of Head Start for working families and the potential economic impact of reducing access to early education. The program faces threats of elimination or reduced funding, which could exacerbate existing child care shortages in the state.</p>

Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration while maintaining Canada's sovereignty. Despite Carney's rejection, Trump continued to express interest in the idea, underscoring the ongoing tensions between the two nations regarding trade and border policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted a legal injunction against the Trump administration, temporarily pausing proposed cuts to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), the primary source of federal funding for public libraries. The injunction, issued in response to a lawsuit from 21 states, argues that the administration's attempt to eliminate the IMLS violates the Administrative Procedure Act. The judge emphasized that Congress holds the power to make laws and appropriate funds, while the executive branch is responsible for implementing those laws. The IMLS provides crucial support to small and rural libraries, and the proposed cuts would have significantly impacted their ability to serve patrons.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences sheds light on the use of psychoactive drugs in ancient Peruvian rituals. Researchers analyzed artifacts from Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a prehistoric site in the Andes, and discovered traces of DMT and tobacco on bone tubes believed to be used for inhalation. The findings suggest that the Chav√≠n people, a predecessor to the Inca civilization, engaged in exclusive, potentially secret gatherings where elite members consumed hallucinogenic substances. These rituals may have played a role in establishing social and political hierarchies within the Chav√≠n society.</p>
