          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, exports to ASEAN countries jumped by 20.8%, with notable growth in Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. This shift indicates China's adaptability in navigating trade tensions by diversifying its export markets and leveraging regional partnerships to sustain economic growth.</p>
