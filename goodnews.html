          <p>BP shares initially surged following reports of potential acquisition talks with Shell, but the increase was tempered after Shell denied the rumors. Sources suggest that if a deal were to materialize, it would likely involve multiple companies purchasing different segments of BP. BP has faced challenges in recent years, including ambitious carbon emission reduction goals and subsequent adjustments to increase oil and gas investments while scaling back renewables spending due to underperformance compared to its rivals. The energy sector is currently undergoing significant shifts as companies balance traditional energy production with renewable energy initiatives.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) held its first meeting following the appointment of several vaccine critics by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a move that has stirred controversy. The panel, composed of independent medical and public experts, evaluates vaccine data and provides recommendations on eligibility and insurance coverage. The new ACIP chair, Dr. Martin Kulldorff, emphasized the importance of evidence-based recommendations, but one of Kennedy's appointees resigned ahead of the meeting due to a mandatory review of financial holdings. The panel will assess data on COVID-19 and RSV vaccines and create new work groups to review childhood vaccine schedules and previously unreviewed shots.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A credit card grace period is the time between the end of your billing cycle and your payment due date when you won't be charged interest on new purchases, provided you pay your full statement balance by the due date. This feature allows cardholders to make purchases without accruing interest, effectively offering a temporary, interest-free loan. To maximize the benefits of a grace period, it's crucial to pay the full statement balance each month, automate payments, track billing cycles, and avoid cash advances. Understanding and utilizing the grace period can help consumers avoid hefty interest charges and make the most of their credit card benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>With credit card debt reaching high levels and interest rates averaging around 22%, finding ways to pay less interest is crucial. Strategies to eliminate interest charges include transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card, paying the balance in full every month, using a 0% APR intro offer for new purchases, enrolling in a credit card hardship program, and requesting a temporary rate reduction. Balance transfer cards offer promotional periods of up to 21 months with no interest, while paying the statement balance in full avoids interest altogether. Utilizing these methods can help consumers take control of their credit card debt (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Ohio Court Ruling on Private School Voucher System Sparks Appeal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Ohio court declared the state's private school voucher system unconstitutional, leading to a swift appeal from Republican Attorney General Dave Yost. The ruling, celebrated by public school advocates, states that the EdChoice voucher program violates the Ohio Constitution's requirement for a thorough and efficient system of common schools. Judge Jaiza Page rejected the ‚Äúschool choice‚Äù argument, emphasizing that the decision to accept students and receive EdChoice funds lies with the private school. The Ohio Christian Education Network expressed strong disagreement, while the Ohio Education Association praised the ruling as a victory for public schools.</p>

          <h2>Paying for a Cell Phone Plan Seen as Key Sign of Adulthood</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 11:56:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that 76% of Americans consider coming off a parent's cell phone plan as a significant sign of adulthood, with 66% believing this should occur by age 21. However, most individuals who pay their own cell phone bill waited until age 27, and 18% didn't start paying until age 40 or later. Experts suggest this milestone symbolizes financial independence and personal responsibility, especially in a world where young adults face high living costs and student loans. The average monthly cell phone bill is $144, making it a substantial expense for many.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he is considering sending additional Patriot missile systems to Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to end the war. Trump, speaking at the NATO summit in The Netherlands, did not rule out a new defense assistance package for Ukraine. He emphasized that Putin needs to end the war and acknowledged the spirit in Ukraine's fight. Trump's stance marks a shift from earlier positions, as he expressed exasperation with Putin's attacks on civilians and floated the possibility of new sanctions if Putin refuses to cooperate in U.S.-led efforts for a settlement.</p>

          <p>Accidental drug overdose and poisoning deaths in Los Angeles County decreased by 22% in 2024, marking the most significant single-year decline on record. The 2024 death toll of 2,438 is the lowest since 2019, with fentanyl-related deaths falling by 37%. Health officials attribute the reversal to increased investments in drug treatment and overdose prevention measures. Despite the decline, the county continues to experience high numbers of overdose deaths, with fentanyl remaining the leading cause. Disparities persist, with Black residents experiencing the highest fentanyl overdose death rate per capita and higher fatality rates in poorer neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The retrial concluded after a mistrial in her initial trial due to a hung jury. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and leaving him to die, but her defense argued she was framed. The case involved intense scrutiny of evidence, witness testimony, and allegations of a cover-up by law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Spicy Turkey Sandwich Recipe</h2>

          <p>This turkey sandwich is a bit spicy, pleasantly crunchy and bound together with a delicious cilantro variation of roasted garlic sunflower seed dip: a dairy-less dip! Soaked sunflower seeds blend into the creamiest, smoothest dip, with a texture similar to a hummus but without the chickpeas or tahini. Thinly sliced cucumber and onions bring a fresh crunchiness that I find essential to a great sandwich. This is a perfectly fresh and light sub for any occasion, but it‚Äôs especially lovely wrapped up and enjoyed at the beach.</p>
