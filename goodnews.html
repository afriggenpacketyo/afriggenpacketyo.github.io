          <p>Linda Yaccarino is stepping down as the CEO of X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, after joining the company in June 2023. In a farewell note, she expressed gratitude to Elon Musk for the opportunity to lead the company's transformation and protect free speech. Her tenure focused on reviving advertising revenue after many major brands paused spending following Musk's acquisition. Despite a significant drop in the company's market value, Yaccarino's leadership saw the return of key advertisers like Amazon and Apple, though her departure comes amid a new chapter for the company involving Musk's xAI venture.</p>

          <p>Sitting around a campfire may provide therapeutic benefits for mental health, according to psychologists and researchers. Studies have shown that the experience can lead to significant reductions in blood pressure and foster improved social interactions. Experts note that the natural setting encourages people to disconnect from technology and daily stressors, creating a disarming and non-judgmental environment for engagement. This atmosphere can help individuals, especially those who are anxious or hesitant, to connect with others and share personal experiences, leveraging the restorative effects of being in nature to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>

          <p>The first 24 hours of Amazon's Prime Day event saw U.S. online sales reach $7.9 billion, a 9.9% increase compared to the previous year, according to Adobe Analytics. This figure marks the largest single e-commerce day of the year so far, surpassing last year's Thanksgiving sales. The major sales event, which now spans four days, has prompted competing retailers like Walmart and Target to launch their own promotions. Despite consumer concerns over tariffs and economic uncertainty, early data shows strong demand for home and outdoor goods, with total online spending across all retailers during the event projected to hit nearly $24 billion.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is making a two-day trip to South Carolina, where he is meeting with local Democratic leaders and voters, intensifying speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. While Newsom has not commented directly on his future ambitions, he is using the visit to urge Democrats to be more assertive in the current political climate and to focus on the 2026 midterm elections. His tour of the key primary state is seen by political strategists as an early effort to build a national profile and ground game. Newsom's message has focused on contrasting his vision with that of President Trump, whom he accuses of being motivated by cruelty and division.</p>

          <p>The Fletcher Street Urban Riding Club, a nonprofit in Philadelphia, is providing free horse riding and care lessons to local children, helping them build confidence and life skills. Founded in 2004 by Ellis Ferrell Jr., the club aims to teach kids to overcome their fears and take control of their lives, much like they learn to control a horse. The program has become a form of therapy for many participants, with alumni going on to successful careers as jockeys, trainers, and even an NFL player. As the neighborhood gentrifies, the club faces an uncertain future, but Ferrell's son is preparing to continue its legacy of community empowerment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has corrected a significant data error, revealing that international student enrollment actually increased by 6.5% last year, rather than declining as previously reported. An analysis flagged the discrepancy, showing that the original data undercounted students by over 200,000. The corrected figures, which track students across various educational programs, now align more closely with other reports from the State Department, indicating robust growth in the number of students from abroad. This revised data provides a more accurate picture of international education trends in the U.S. at a time of heightened attention on the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's invitation to five African leaders for a White House meeting is being interpreted as a significant shift in U.S. policy towards the continent. Analysts suggest the move reflects a more transactional, "America First" approach focused on competing with China and Russia for Africa's strategic resources, such as minerals and oil. The discussions are expected to center on security cooperation to combat the spread of Islamist insurgencies, migration control, and resource access. This contrasts with previous administrations' focus on poverty reduction and development, indicating a pivot to a "give and take" style of diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced plans to offer a generic version of semaglutide in Canada, as the patent for Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy is set to expire there in January. This marks the company's first expansion into Canada and positions it to compete in the growing market for GLP-1 medications. The move follows Novo Nordisk's decision to let its Canadian patent lapse after failing to pay maintenance fees. Hims & Hers joins other drugmakers, like Sandoz, that are preparing to launch cheaper, generic versions of the highly sought-after treatment.</p>

          <p>Major tech stocks, including Microsoft and Nvidia, experienced a rally, with Nvidia briefly surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization. Market analyst Jim Cramer advised investors to hold onto Nvidia stock for the long term rather than engaging in short-term trading. In other business news, coffee giant Starbucks has reportedly received interest from nearly 30 firms about acquiring a stake in its Chinese operations, a move that could value the division at up to $10 billion. Cramer endorsed this strategy as part of CEO Brian Niccol's turnaround plan and recommended buying the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>
