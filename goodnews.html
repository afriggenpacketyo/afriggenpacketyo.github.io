          <p>A new tax proposal from the Trump administration includes a significant change for charitable giving, offering a new deduction for the 90% of filers who do not itemize. The provision would allow single filers to deduct up to $1,000 and married couples up to $2,000 for cash donations, starting in 2026. This measure is similar to a smaller, temporary deduction enacted during the pandemic, which was claimed by nearly 48 million filers. Financial experts note that taxpayers planning to use this break must still maintain meticulous records, including written acknowledgements from charities for donations of $250 or more.

          <p>Inflation in the euro zone held steady at 2% in July, surpassing economists' expectations of a slight decrease to 1.9%. Core inflation, which excludes volatile items like food and energy, also remained unchanged at 2.3%, suggesting persistent price pressures. This data makes it less likely that the European Central Bank will resume interest rate cuts in the near future. The figures arrive as the European economy shows resilience but also faces headwinds from external factors, including new US trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in South Africa have launched an innovative anti-poaching initiative called the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting a harmless radioactive substance into rhinoceros horns. The technique, developed over six years at the University of the Witwatersrand, makes the horns detectable by nuclear security systems at international borders, aiming to disrupt smuggling networks. The process has been confirmed as safe for the animals. This novel approach is designed to protect South Africa's vast rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers who sell the horns in Asian markets for use in traditional medicine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Guardian opinion piece by Simon Jenkins argues that while much of what Donald Trump says can be dismissed, his focus on aesthetics is a noteworthy and refreshing aspect of his politics. The article highlights Trump's executive order promoting classical architecture for federal buildings and his vocal criticism of wind turbines for spoiling scenic landscapes in Scotland and the US. Jenkins suggests that this willingness to openly discuss beauty and ugliness in public policy is a rare trait among modern politicians. The columnist compares this aspect of Trump to Teddy Roosevelt's concern for America's natural environment, finding value in a leader unashamed to prioritize visual impact.</p>

Knight expressed his excitement, stating that writing for the iconic franchise has always been on his bucket list and that he hopes to create something "better, stronger and bolder." The announcement marks a key step in the post-Daniel Craig era of the franchise, though speculation continues over who will be cast as the new 007.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, leaving only 250 troops to protect federal property as anti-ICE protests have diminished. The initial deployment of 4,000 soldiers and 700 Marines in June was met with strong opposition from California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued to end what he termed "political theater." Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the withdrawal as a "win for Los Angeles," stating the troops were used as props instead of addressing real emergencies. The move signals a de-escalation of federal presence in the city.</p>

          <h2>Florida Law on Fallen Trees and Neighbor Disputes Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Florida enters peak hurricane season, residents are reminded of the state's "no-fault" tree law, which generally leaves property owners responsible for damage caused by a neighbor's fallen tree. Under the current "Massachusetts Rule," if a tree falls due to a natural event or "act of God," the owner of the damaged property must cover the cleanup and repair costs through their own insurance. The tree's owner is typically only liable if negligence, such as ignoring a dead or hazardous tree, can be proven. Recent legislative efforts to shift liability to the tree's owner, known as the "Fallen Tree Act," failed to pass this year.</p>

The organization plans to serve older adults with memory loss by using AI music platforms like Suno to create songs in nostalgic genres that are difficult to replicate with its current roster of songwriters. While the move allows for scaling its mission, it has raised concerns among some in the "music as medicine" community.

          <p>After previously opposing the deal, President Trump has approved the sale of the iconic U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel. The approval comes with a unique condition: a "golden share" that grants the president himself significant influence over the company's future decisions. This special share provision is a mechanism typically used by governments to retain control over privatized state assets or strategically important companies. The move allows the sale to proceed while ensuring a degree of continued American oversight over the historic steel manufacturer, reflecting a blend of free-market action and national interest protection.</p>

          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, driven by the highly successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which was released on June 5, helping push total revenue to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), far exceeding analyst expectations. Despite the strong start and a 40% rally in its stock price this year, Nintendo has maintained its conservative annual sales forecast of 15 million units for the console. The company also stated that potential US tariffs are not expected to have a significant impact on its earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves by boosting the number of working-class entrants. Participants who perform well in the paid summer internship will be fast-tracked in the selection process for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move is part of a broader government initiative to diversify talent and establish more career paths outside of London.</p>

          <p>A new law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect in the UK, banning the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords. The campaign for the law was led by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by a teenager who had easily purchased the weapon online. The law, which also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders, is part of a broader government effort to combat knife crime. A month-long surrender scheme preceding the ban saw over 1,000 of the weapons removed from the streets.</p>
