          <p>Vani Hari, formerly known as the Food Babe, has transitioned from dispensing diet and fitness tips to becoming a key figure in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda, championed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Hari, once a critic of the FDA, now praises the agency's efforts to eradicate petroleum-based food dyes. Her ascent has garnered support from her followers but has also drawn criticism from food industry executives and scientists who accuse her of promoting pseudoscience. Despite the controversy, Hari's influence reflects a shift in food policy, with Trump supporters now advocating for organic produce and the removal of ultraprocessed foods from schools.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the pros and cons of callable CDs, noting that they offer higher interest rates but allow the bank to redeem them before maturity. Experts advise considering callable CDs only if the rate is significantly higher than traditional CDs and if you have a solid reinvestment strategy. Alternatives like traditional CDs and high-yield savings accounts may be better for those prioritizing stability and predictability. The key is to carefully compare options to maximize savings while rates remain elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An environmental correspondent describes visiting the Northern Jaguar Reserve in Sonora, Mexico, where jaguars are being conserved through a project that pays ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land. This program, called Viviendo con Felinos, has helped to shift local attitudes towards jaguars, turning them from perceived threats to valuable assets. Ranchers are incentivized to protect the cats and their prey, leading to a more harmonious coexistence between humans and wildlife. The success of this project offers hope for the potential reestablishment of jaguars in the United States, depending on maintaining openings in the border wall.</p>

The NPP will allow drivers to use any major parking app at participating car parks, with the British Parking Association taking over the scheme's operation. The trial period showed positive results, and the government asserts that this initiative will encourage a more flexible parking experience without increasing parking fees. Motorists' association the RAC welcomed the move but said it needed to be taken on much more widely before it made a real difference to drivers.</p>
