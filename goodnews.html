          <p>Portugal's anti-immigration Chega party has become the main opposition in parliament, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The party secured 60 of the 230 seats in the National Assembly after recent elections, capitalizing on concerns about immigration and the instability of traditional parties. Chega's rise reflects a broader trend of far-right movements gaining traction in Europe, challenging the dominance of center-right and center-left parties. Led by Andre Ventura, Chega campaigned on a platform of nationalism and promises to "Save Portugal," indicating a potential reshaping of political discourse and policy priorities in the country.</p>

          <p>Marc Marquez, an eight-time world champion, is now a contender for the 2025 MotoGP title after overcoming a challenging period marked by injuries and multiple surgeries. After nearly 1,000 days without a race victory, Marquez left Honda, his team of 11 years, to join Gresini Racing, a satellite Ducati team. This move allowed him to prove his speed and competitiveness, leading him to the factory Ducati team and the top of the championship standings.

This collaboration involves hiring engineers from the automotive industry, leveraging the expertise of Renk's CEO and COO, who have experience in the automotive sector. While this shift provides employment opportunities, IG Metall, a trade union, cautions against a singular focus on rearmament and emphasizes the need for lasting peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a blow to his economic policies, as the Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to halt the tariffs, though most are currently suspended, and also blocked levies on China, Mexico, and Canada.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts anticipate pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. The company projects a 34.9% drop in net profit for the full business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. While emphasizing that security matters and tariff negotiations are based on different principles, the negotiator acknowledged the possibility of including defense spending in discussions. Japan is seeking the withdrawal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum, but the Trump administration has resisted complete removal. The Japanese government may consider accepting lower duty rates to reach a trade deal. (not investment advice)</p>

CBS appealed the ruling, and an appellate panel has granted CBS' request to keep the stay in place, allowing the network to continue its distribution duties during the appeal.

Musk thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), but expressed disappointment with the budget bill. The departure comes amid reports of clashes with cabinet-level officials and criticism of DOGE's efforts. Musk's time in government overlapped with a decline in sales at his electric car company, and his political activities drew protests from some investors.</p>
