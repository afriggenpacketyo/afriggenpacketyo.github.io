        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price experienced a significant jump, surpassing $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by optimism surrounding a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with President Trump's announcement of a broad trade outline, which also boosted stock markets. Market analysts suggest that bitcoin's recent performance underscores its resilience and status as a safe-haven asset amid global economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions, including rising tensions between India and Pakistan. However, they caution that bitcoin's resilience will continue to be tested by ongoing volatility and macroeconomic factors.</p>

Gates remains optimistic about leveraging advancements in biomedical tools and A.I. to combat diseases like tuberculosis and H.I.V., expressing a commitment to innovation and partnerships to improve global health outcomes.

          <p>Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected as the new Pope, taking the name Leo XIV, marking a historic moment as the first American to hold the position. Prevost, who spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, is seen as a figure of hope for Latin American Catholics, especially in the U.S., where they represent a growing sector of the Church. His focus on social justice, pastoral care, and the empowerment of marginalized communities resonates deeply with those who feel their voices have been ignored.

          <p>Despite a slowdown in deal-making by single-family offices, AI-related startups are still attracting significant attention, with SandboxAQ finalizing a $450 million Series E round after upsizing the fundraise due to investor demand. The Palo Alto-based firm, which spun off from Alphabet in 2022, uses AI and quantum technology for large-scale predictions and statistical analysis across various industries. CEO Jack Hidary notes that professionally managed family offices and large institutions have developed a greater appetite for deep-tech startups that cater to businesses, recognizing the lower risk associated with investing in companies with a strong competitive advantage. This trend indicates a shift towards more strategic and long-term investments in innovative technologies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn his nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following opposition from Senate Democrats and some Republicans. Martin's nomination faced scrutiny due to his support for Jan. 6 defendants and controversial statements. As interim U.S. Attorney, Martin directed the firing of prosecutors who worked on Jan. 6 cases, raising concerns about his impartiality. The U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. is one of the most important federal law enforcement roles in the country. This decision highlights the challenges Trump faces in securing Senate confirmation for controversial nominees.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the importance of understanding the minimum draw requirements associated with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). Lenders may require an upfront draw, even if you don't need the funds right away, and they may also have ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period. These rules can affect your interest costs and repayment plans, and it's important to understand how these requirements might impact the total cost of borrowing. If the terms don't align with how and when you plan to borrow, it may be worth considering alternatives like a home equity loan.</p>
