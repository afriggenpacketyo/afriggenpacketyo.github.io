          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed performance as investors digested the news of Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation amidst growing pressure following a national election defeat. Japan's Nikkei 225 index experienced a notable surge of 1.5% following the announcement, while the Topix index reached a record high, climbing 1%. The Japanese yen weakened against the US dollar, and Japanese government bond yields increased as investors anticipated potential policy shifts and economic uncertainty in the coming months. Analysts from BMI suggest Japan is entering a period of uncertainty as the ruling party prepares to select a new leader. Optimism among investors is tempered by concerns over the country's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a viral video depicting a wedding crasher stealing a gift box containing approximately $60,000 in cash and checks, Glendale police apprehended two men in connection to the crime. Armean Shirehjini was arrested at his Sherman Oaks residence, while Andranik Avetisyan, identified as the getaway driver, was taken into custody in Los Angeles. Surveillance footage revealed Shirehjini casually navigating the wedding reception before absconding with the donation box. During the arrest, authorities discovered a handgun in Shirehjini's possession, along with firearms and drugs; detectives recovered 26 checks and about $10,000 in cash. The investigation remains ongoing to determine the motive and whether the suspects have committed similar crimes. The mood in the community is relief as the suspects have been apprehended.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece critiques Rahm Emanuel's assertion that China could serve as an external threat to restore internal cohesion in American politics. The article challenges the notion that China is inherently an enemy and disputes Emanuel's interpretation of Chinese President Xi Jinping's views on the United States. The author argues that China's economic rise is not a threat but a result of its own development, and that blaming China for America's internal divisions is misguided. The piece underscores the importance of self-reflection and responsible governance rather than seeking external scapegoats. The author's tone is critical of American foreign policy. </p>

          <p>The South Korean government announced an agreement with the U.S. to release its citizens who were detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. A chartered plane is being arranged to transport the detainees home after administrative procedures are finalized. South Korean authorities are working to improve the visa system to prevent similar incidents in the future. The raid, which detained 475 people, predominantly South Korean nationals, raised concerns about its impact on foreign investment and trade relations between the two countries. The incident has sparked diplomatic discussions and efforts to ensure fair treatment for South Korean workers in the U.S. The situation is improving with the repatriation agreement.</p>
