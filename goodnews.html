          <p>The tradition of Indianapolis 500 winners drinking milk began in 1936 when Louis Meyer drank buttermilk after his third victory, a moment captured by a cameraman and promoted by the dairy industry. While winners from 1947 to 1954 were handed water, the milk tradition returned in 1956, and since then, 69 consecutive winners have enjoyed milk in the victory circle. The tradition reflects a blend of personal preference, historical accident, and marketing savvy, solidifying milk as an iconic symbol of the Indy 500 celebration. The winner of the race will be given an ice-cold bottle of milk in the victory circle.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, surpassing $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism surrounding U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. This price increase occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Macro concerns, including Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have further supported Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a known bitcoin skeptic, has also announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan has appointed Freddy Lim, the frontman of the heavy metal band Chthonic, as its envoy to Finland, a country known for having the most metal bands per capita. Lim's selection is based not only on his musical fame but also on his human rights work and international exchange experience, as he served as a national legislator and chairman of Amnesty International in Taiwan. Chthonic, known as "the Black Sabbath of Asia," incorporates elements of Taiwanese local lore into its music, using its performances to advocate for Taiwan's recognition on the international stage. While heavy metal fans have largely embraced the appointment, some opposition legislators have raised questions about Lim's suitability for the role.</p>

          <p>China has called on the European Union to ensure a fair trade environment following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. The European Commission is proposing a two-euro fee for small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, and a 50-cent fee for parcels sent to European warehouses. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Mao Ning stated that an open and inclusive trade environment is in the common interest of all parties and urged the EU to provide a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after a cyber-attack left users unable to browse for several hours, following weeks of disrupted online orders. The retailer estimates the cyber-attack will reduce this year's profits by around £300 million, though some of this will be covered by insurance. The cyber attack, which took place over the Easter weekend, initially affected click-and-collect and contactless payments, leading to the suspension of all online orders. Police are investigating the incident, focusing on a hacking group known as Scattered Spider, believed to be behind attacks on other retailers.</p>
