          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere soon due to a rocket malfunction that left it stranded in orbit. The New York Times article explains that because the spacecraft was designed with a heat shield to survive Venus's atmosphere, it may partially survive its re-entry into Earth's atmosphere. While the exact timing and location of re-entry are uncertain, scientists are closely tracking its descent, though the risk of injury on the ground is considered low. If any pieces of the spacecraft survive the impact, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, was previously sanctioned by the Football Association for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan stated she raised concerns with the referee regarding fairness and safety after learning the player was transgender. The BBC article reports that the FA's appeal board later found Vaughan's hearing "unfair," quashing the original ruling and ordering a new process, but the case was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan, now 18, asserts the case has negatively impacted her life and seeks an apology from the FA, who have declined to comment further.</p>
