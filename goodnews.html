        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in drug overdose deaths, with provisional data showing 27,000 fewer deaths in 2024 compared to 2023. This marks the steepest single-year decline in 45 years, bringing deaths back to pre-pandemic levels. The drop is widespread across 45 states, with synthetic opioid deaths falling the fastest. Factors contributing to this decline include the increased availability of naloxone, telehealth access to addiction treatment, opioid-settlement cash, and tougher enforcement on fentanyl. However, deaths from stimulants like meth and cocaine are rising, and proposed budget cuts to naloxone distribution pose a threat.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. This reciprocal arrangement aims to provide opportunities for young people while avoiding a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. The UK already has similar agreements with countries like Australia. The proposal has faced criticism, with some describing it as "free movement through the back door," but supporters argue it would benefit businesses and young people alike.</p>

This technology, detailed in a paper by Zhang Xin from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre (CARDC), holds potential for extending the endurance of high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drones, allowing them to fly much longer.</p>

Toyota plans to focus on local development and production, while Honda considers moving production of some models to the United States from Japan and Canada. (not investment advice)</p>
