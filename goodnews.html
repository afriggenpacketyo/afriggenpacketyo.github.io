          <p>Getty Images is allocating millions to combat what its CEO, Craig Peters, describes as a "world of rhetoric" surrounding its lawsuit against Stability AI. Peters asserts that Stability AI, along with other AI labs, is unlawfully using copyright-protected material to train their AI models for commercial purposes, which constitutes unfair competition and theft. Getty Images is suing Stability AI in both the U.K. and U.S., alleging the unauthorized copying of 12 million images, and Stability AI contests these claims. The CEO believes that this lawsuit is important to protect content creators and ensure fair practices within the rapidly evolving AI industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade for jet engines, marking a significant advancement in the country's aeronautics industry. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. Developed by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), this innovation is expected to benefit both military and civilian aircraft. This patent reinforces China's leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies by improving the thermal tolerance of the blades, which are critical components in modern jet engines.</p>

          <p>Five mainland Chinese companies, including Muyuan Foods, BASiC Semiconductor, FS.com, Shanghai Seer, and Worldwide Logistics, have filed preliminary listing applications with the Hong Kong stock exchange to raise capital. Muyuan Foods, a major hog breeder and pork producer, aims to raise up to US$1 billion through a secondary listing to fund its global expansion. The filings mark the initial step in the Hong Kong IPO process, which has seen a sevenfold increase in fundraising to HK$76 billion this year. Hong Kong's IPO market has raised nearly 90% of last year's full-year proceeds in the first five months of 2025, indicating a strong resurgence in activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan suggests decriminalizing the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use. The London Drugs Commission's report, chaired by Lord Falconer, recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) and maintaining it as a controlled substance under the Psychoactive Substances Act (PSA). Sir Sadiq Khan supports the report, stating current rules "cannot be justified" and that the commission's findings provide "a compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalization. The report also suggests improving public health services for cannabis-related harm and enhancing cannabis education, while opponents argue that decriminalization would wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful.</p>

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, known as NB.1.8.1, is proliferating in the U.S. following a surge in China, though it's not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards.

The WHO has designated NB.1.8.1 as a variant under monitoring, noting its spread throughout 22 countries, including the U.S. The WHO evaluates the public health risk posed by this variant as low at the global level, current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.</p>

Discussions are expected to center on continued military assistance, particularly the long-range Taurus missile system, which Germany developed with Sweden. Merz has reiterated his support for Ukraine and the use of sanctions to pressure Russia to agree to a cease-fire, contrasting with the cooler initial relationship between Zelensky and former Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</p>

          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record number of puffins, with 43,626 birds counted this year, despite a rapid decline in global puffin populations. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) attributes this success to the island's isolation, which protects the birds from predators and human impact. Skomer is also home to 350,000 breeding pairs of manx shearwaters and thousands of guillemots and razorbills. Conservationists believe the abundance of food in the area and the absence of predators have contributed to the puffins' thriving population, making it a conservation success story.</p>

The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, aiming to advance green transformation and decarbonization. Companies will be allotted a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the threshold will need to purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus. The system is designed to incentivize emissions reduction, though companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>
