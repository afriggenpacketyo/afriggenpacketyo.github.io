          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a critical test of his leadership as he works to secure votes for a major bill advancing President Trump's agenda. Johnson is working to reconcile concerns from both conservative and moderate Republicans, focusing on issues like Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions. Trump is actively involved, encouraging Republicans to support the bill, even planning to attend the House GOP conference to rally support. The bill, facing a tight deadline to address the debt limit by mid-July, is undergoing modifications to address concerns raised by the Senate parliamentarian, making the process fragile and subject to change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the government's increasing debt burden and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5%, a level not seen since November 2023, before settling slightly lower. The downgrade, while largely symbolic as Moody's was the last major agency to maintain the top rating, reflects growing investor unease about the nation's fiscal health. These yields directly impact loan rates for houses and credit cards, potentially raising costs for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Republicans are planning a vote on a tax bill that includes President Trump's agenda, but internal disagreements persist. Speaker Johnson expressed confidence in reaching a final agreement, but conservative hardliners and moderates remain divided over issues like the state and local tax deduction (SALT) and Medicaid work requirements. Trump is expected to pressure Republicans to pass the bill, even attending the House Republican conference meeting. The legislation is likely to face resistance in the Senate, adding urgency to the House's efforts to pass the bill before the Memorial Day recess and a looming debt limit deadline in July.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered Apple to resolve its ongoing dispute with Epic Games regarding the popular game Fortnite or face a court hearing. Fortnite was blocked by Apple after its recent resubmission, prompting Epic Games to file a motion to enforce an earlier injunction. The judge stated that Apple is capable of resolving the issue without further intervention. If the conflict remains unresolved, the Apple official responsible for compliance must personally appear at a hearing scheduled for May 27 in the Northern District of California.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, stating that the president exceeded his authority. Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of the USIP president and board members, declaring the transfers of the institute's assets null and void. The judge determined that USIP is part of the federal government but not the executive branch, supporting both the Executive and Legislative branches as an independent think tank. Trump's actions, including firing board members and gutting the institute's operations, were deemed a gross usurpation of power.</p>

The Mossad, in collaboration with a foreign government, retrieved the archives, which may shed light on Cohen's activities and final moments. Cohen's intelligence work in Syria in the early 1960s provided valuable information that helped Israel achieve victory in the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, highlighting the significance of this recovery.</p>

Executives from Trump Media & Technology Group and advisers to Saudi Arabia are involved in these deals. The resurgence follows a pandemic-era boom and subsequent downturn, with increased investor interest in risky ventures and crypto.

          <p>The Spanish government has ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform due to violations of housing rules, including lacking licenses or providing fake license numbers. The government aims to address a housing crisis where the conversion of residential properties into tourist accommodations has driven up prices. Airbnb stated that the root cause of the issue is a lack of housing supply and that stricter restrictions have failed to ease local housing challenges. The company said it will continue to appeal all decisions linked to the case. The prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has sought to curb foreign buyers, including by proposing a 100 percent tax aimed at foreign real estate investors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Having 100% home equity means a homeowner has paid off their mortgage balance in full, or bought the home for cash, resulting in the total home value being theirs without owing anything to a lender. Lenders typically allow borrowing up to 80% to 90% of the home's value, even with 100% equity. Homeowners with this level of equity are generally considered less risky borrowers, positioning them for better rate offers and terms. Home equity loans provide a lump sum, while HELOCs (home equity lines of credit) offer variable rates and interest-only payments during the draw period, making each suitable depending on individual needs and the interest rate climate.</p>

Mounting pressure also came from the powerful Novo Nordisk Foundation, the controlling shareholder of the Danish drugmaker. New U.S. prescriptions of Zepbound surpassed those for Wegovy for the first time in early March 2024, just months after the launch of Eli Lilly's drug, Reuters reported at the time.</p>
