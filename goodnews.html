          <p>President Trump announced progress on a deal concerning TikTok's ownership following a conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The discussion, described as productive, also included an agreement for Trump to visit China early next year and for the leaders to meet at the APEC Summit in November. While a framework for the agreement was previously announced by the Treasury, Trump noted that the deal has not yet been fully negotiated. The call signals a potential resolution to the ongoing dispute over the popular social media platform's operations in the United States.</p>

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that NBA player Kevin Durant has successfully recovered access to his bitcoin account on the cryptocurrency exchange after being locked out for several years. Durant, who purchased the bitcoin in 2016 when its value was significantly lower, had recently joked about the situation at a conference. The high-profile case has drawn attention to ongoing customer service issues at Coinbase, which has faced criticism for difficulties users experience in account recovery and support.

          <p>Navan, a startup specializing in corporate travel and expense management, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "NAVN." The company, formerly known as TripActions, reported $613 million in revenue over the last twelve months from over 10,000 customers. This move is part of a broader resurgence in the IPO market, which has seen its most active year since 2021, with other major tech firms also recently going public. Navan aims to disrupt the business travel sector with its all-in-one platform, competing with both new and established players in the industry.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a new funding round that would value the company at $200 billion. This development reflects the soaring valuations in the AI sector, following similar large fundraising efforts by competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report, the funds would likely be used to build out the massive computing infrastructure required for developing advanced AI models, including a large AI supercomputer in Memphis. The company's chatbot, Grok, has faced controversy and is considered to be lagging behind its main rivals.</p>

Despite a decisive win in a recent warm-up match, their last Six Nations encounter was a narrow one-point victory for England, suggesting a competitive game ahead.

          <h2>10-Year Treasury Yield Rises to Two-Week High Despite Recent Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased on Friday, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, even after the Federal Reserve implemented its first interest rate cut of the year. This counterintuitive movement suggests that investors in longer-term debt are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, such as expectations for economic growth, inflation, and government debt issuance. The Fed reduced its benchmark rate by a quarter point to a range of 4.00%-4.25%, with policymakers signaling that more cuts are likely this year. Recent economic data, including stable jobless claims, has eased some concerns about a slowing economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders offensive coordinator Chip Kelly addressed reports that team minority owner Tom Brady is involved in weekly game planning, stating the claims are not accurate. Kelly clarified that while he uses Brady as a resource to discuss football concepts and strategies, the seven-time Super Bowl champion does not participate in formulating weekly game plans. The clarification came after an ESPN sideline report suggested Brady was in regular contact with Kelly about strategy, and coach Pete Carroll also refuted the report. The NFL has stated that there are no policies prohibiting an owner from sitting in the coaches' booth during a game.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from Wolfe Research indicates that U.S. electricity demand is set to grow significantly over the next five years, largely driven by the power requirements of AI data centers. The report projects the addition of 265 gigawatts of electricity supply by 2029, a substantial increase from previous estimates. This trend is expected to create a favorable outlook for industrial companies like GE Vernova, which manufactures power-generating turbines, and Eaton, which produces electrical equipment for data centers and the grid. For GE Vernova, strong demand and limited production capacity are creating favorable pricing dynamics and a multi-year revenue backlog. (not investment advice)</p>

Zelenskiy emphasized that the primary goals remain equipping Ukrainian brigades and building up national arsenals, with exports serving as a third priority. The strategy will also include robust export controls to prevent Ukrainian technology from falling into the hands of Russia or its allies.</p>

The new guidance clarifies that certain professions, such as those in healthcare and legal services, will not qualify. Additionally, the agencies confirmed that automatic gratuities, which are not voluntary payments from customers, will not be considered qualified tips eligible for the tax break, which will be an important distinction for workers and employers.</p>

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, borrowing costs are beginning to decrease from their recent highs, offering some relief to consumers. Among the cheapest current options for borrowing money are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have an average rate of 8.05% and a variable rate that could fall further with future cuts. Home equity loans offer a slightly higher but fixed rate, providing more predictable payments. While personal loan rates remain in the double digits, they are still a more affordable alternative to high-interest credit cards and do not require home collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Robert Redford's extensive film career is being remembered for its consistent and insightful theme: the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. Across iconic roles in films like "Downhill Racer," "The Candidate," and "The Natural," he often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal triumphs came at a significant moral or personal cost. Redford, himself a talented athlete in his youth, used his work as both an actor and director to critique America's obsession with winning. This artistic focus, from his independent projects to his mainstream hits, reveals a deep-seated skepticism of success and a belief that true value lies in the process, not the outcome.</p>
