          <p>The U.S. government has lifted travel restrictions previously imposed on Hungarian passport holders, restoring the full two-year validity for travel authorizations under the Visa Waiver Program. The restrictions were initially implemented due to security concerns over Hungary's simplified naturalization process, which granted citizenship to nearly a million people without adequate vetting. This policy reversal signals a warming of diplomatic relations between the two nations, a shift from the colder relationship seen during the previous administration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average 30-year mortgage refinance rates dipping to around 6.7%, some homeowners are considering refinancing to lower their monthly payments or consolidate high-interest debt. Experts suggest that those with rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, but also caution against trying to perfectly time the market, as rates could fall further. The decision to refinance should be based on individual financial needs, such as improving cash flow or paying off credit cards, rather than solely chasing the lowest possible rate.

Parents will be able to link their accounts to their teen's, set usage limits, manage features, and receive alerts in cases of acute distress.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a cooling job market and economic uncertainty, a trend of 'job hugging' has emerged, with workers clinging to their current positions rather than seeking new ones. The national 'quits' rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, as employees feel safer in familiar roles. Career experts advise that while staying put can be a sound strategy, workers should avoid complacency by actively seeking internal growth opportunities, expanding their skills, and building their professional networks. This ensures they remain valuable and are prepared for when the hiring market eventually improves.</p>

          <p>King Charles, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales and other senior royals, attended the funeral of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, at Westminster Cathedral. Queen Camilla was unable to attend as she is recovering from acute sinusitis. The service was the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in modern times and included a message from the Pope praising the Duchess for her charitable work. The Duchess, who died at 92, was remembered for her kindness, love of music, and dedication to various causes.</p>

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok's U.S. operations is expected to be finalized within 30 to 45 days, involving a mix of new investors and existing investors from its parent company, ByteDance. Under the deal, technology company Oracle will maintain its cloud and data security agreement with the social media platform. This arrangement aims to resolve long-standing U.S. government concerns about potential Chinese access to American user data. The deal's structure follows years of negotiations and a law mandating that ByteDance divest from its U.S. operations or face a ban.</p>

          <p>A new direct shipping route for break-bulk cargo has been launched between Suzhou, China, and the port of Chancay in Peru, operated by Cosco Shipping. Unlike container ships, break-bulk vessels transport oversized or irregularly shaped goods, and this first voyage is carrying over 30,000 tonnes of equipment, including materials for Peru's mining industry. The new monthly service is expected to take about 32 days and strengthens trade and logistical ties between China and the strategic South American gateway.</p>

          <p>The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has released new crash test results for seven popular electric vehicles, showing varied performance in safety. The BMW i4, Chevrolet Blazer EV, Tesla Cybertruck, and Volkswagen ID.Buzz earned the top rating of 'good' in a key frontal crash test. However, the Ford F-150 Lightning received a 'poor' rating due to a high risk of injury for rear-seat passengers in that test. Most vehicles performed well in pedestrian crash avoidance, but headlight performance was inconsistent across the models tested.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated he is confident that a trade agreement with China can be reached before the November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs to take effect. Bessent noted that recent talks have become increasingly productive and believes that China now sees a deal as possible. The ongoing trade negotiations aim to resolve disputes that led to the announcement of significant tariffs, which have since been suspended to allow for diplomacy. The U.S. trade deficit with China is already on pace to decline significantly this year.</p>
