          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule successfully completed its 16-hour journey to the International Space Station, delivering a new four-person crew. The team, consisting of two NASA astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut, and a Japanese flier, was warmly welcomed aboard by the station's existing seven members. This crew rotation comes amid discussions at NASA about potentially extending mission durations from six to eight months due to proposed budget cuts, a prospect the new crew commander has welcomed.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's order restricting immigration enforcement tactics in the Los Angeles area. The ruling affirms that federal agents cannot use factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish as the sole basis for detaining individuals, as this violates the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration's "roving patrols," which advocates argued were unconstitutional and instilled fear in the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has reportedly increased its stake in data center operator Equinix following a significant stock price drop. The drop was triggered by Equinix's announcement of higher-than-expected capital expenditures and a downgraded forecast for adjusted funds from operations (AFFO). This article suggests that while short-term investors were spooked, Elliott, with its deep experience in the data center sector, sees a long-term opportunity in Equinix's expansion to meet growing AI-driven demand. The firm may push for improved market communication and cost optimization. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-02 07:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to travel experts, the primary reason for purchasing an early boarding upgrade on flights is to guarantee space for carry-on luggage in the overhead bins. As airlines, including now Southwest, move towards more structured boarding processes, passengers in later groups risk having to check their bags. Besides paying for an add-on, travelers can also gain priority boarding by achieving elite status with an airline, using a co-branded credit card, or booking more expensive premium economy fares. For those without overhead luggage, the extra cost is likely unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Pro Football Hall of Famer and University of Colorado coach Deion Sanders recently underwent a neobladder reconstruction after being diagnosed with bladder cancer. The complex procedure involves surgeons creating a new bladder from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. Sanders has been open about the challenges of recovery, including incontinence, in an effort to destigmatize the condition and encourage others. His surgeon noted the innovative, robotic-assisted procedure allows the body to accept the new organ without immunosuppressant drugs.</p>

Mirna volunteered to be tested and, against odds of approximately 1-in-100,000, was found to be a strong genetic match. The couple, who met later in life, see this as a blessing that will allow them to continue their life together.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Lakers' 2020 'Bubble' Championship Should Be Respected, Not Disparaged</h2>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments from a Philadelphia 76ers executive and others who have questioned the legitimacy of the Los Angeles Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that winning the title inside the COVID-19 "Bubble" was not easier but required immense courage, mental fortitude, and resilience from players who were isolated from their families during a global pandemic. The piece contends that instead of an asterisk, the championship deserves an exclamation point for overcoming unprecedented and emotionally taxing circumstances.</p>

          <p>In this personal column, a Los Angeles resident describes his worry when his regular watermelon street vendor, Ivan, disappeared from his corner for weeks. The author's concern reflects the broader anxiety within immigrant communities during a period of heightened immigration enforcement by federal agents. After several weeks, the author learned that Ivan and his brother had been "lying low" after a family member was taken, but they eventually returned to their cart once things calmed down. The story illustrates the human impact of immigration policies on everyday life and community bonds.</p>

          <p>Workers at four Blue Bottle coffee shops in the San Francisco Bay Area have voted decisively to unionize, joining a growing movement of barista organizing across the United States. The employees will join the Blue Bottle Independent Union, which previously organized six locations in the Boston area. Workers are seeking higher wages to cope with the high cost of living, improved benefits, and the return of perks lost after Nestlé acquired a majority stake in the specialty coffee chain in 2017.</p>

          <h2>Growing Number of People Choose to Live in Shenzhen While Commuting to Work in Hong Kong</h2>

          <p>A growing number of young professionals are opting to live in the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen and endure a long daily commute to their jobs in Hong Kong. The primary motivation for this trend is the significant difference in living costs, particularly rent, which allows them to afford to live alone—a luxury that is often prohibitively expensive in Hong Kong. This cross-border lifestyle, facilitated by efficient transport links, highlights the increasing economic integration of the two cities, as commuters trade time for more affordable living arrangements.</p>
