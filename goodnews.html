        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's involvement in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The country's fertility rate is estimated at 1.1 children per woman, significantly below the replacement level of 2.1. </p>
