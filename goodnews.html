          <p>Consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China are actively adapting to the significant surge in global gold prices, which have seen an increase of over 48% this year and reached unprecedented local highs. Despite these elevated costs, the cultural demand for gold wedding jewellery remains strong, with many individuals feeling compelled to purchase items for upcoming ceremonies. Major retailers, such as Chow Tai Fook, have observed a gradual acceptance among consumers of this new price environment since March of the previous year. This ongoing trend highlights the deep-rooted cultural importance of gold in the region, coupled with the resilient market dynamics that allow for continued demand even amidst substantial price fluctuations.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, widely recognized for his antagonist role in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a recent confrontation at a car wash. Prosecutors in Los Angeles officially declined to file any criminal charges after three women accused Cruz of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his vehicle in front of his Silver Lake residence. According to Cruz's agent, Raphael Berko, the actor had initially requested the women to move a safe distance away from his car to prevent them from getting wet. Berko further asserted that any water splashing onto the women was purely incidental, occurring as Cruz turned to ask them to cease recording him. This decision effectively brings the legal aspect of the parking dispute to a close, with no further action against the actor.</p>

          <p>Shares of prominent South Korean chip manufacturers, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, experienced a substantial surge on Thursday, with SK Hynix reaching its highest valuation in 25 years. This significant market movement occurred just one day after both companies announced a strategic partnership with artificial-intelligence giant OpenAI, as part of its ambitious Stargate initiative. The collaboration is specifically designed to boost the supply of advanced memory chips, which are critically essential for powering next-generation AI technologies, and to expand data center capacity within Korea. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman held meetings with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and top executives from both Samsung and SK Hynix to formalize these agreements. This development firmly establishes the South Korean firms as pivotal players in the rapidly expanding and highly competitive AI value chain, signaling strong future growth.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee, a brand with 133 years of history, has launched a highly successful viral marketing campaign, humorously rebranding itself as “Maxwell Apartment Coffee” to directly address the severe and widespread unaffordability of housing in the United States. The campaign features engaging advertisements, such as one asking, "Maxwell House? In this economy?", and offers an "affordable" solution with a year's supply of coffee available for under $40 on Amazon. This article effectively taps into a prevalent national frustration, as evidenced by the median age of first-time homebuyers reaching an all-time high of 38 and a record low proportion of homes being affordable for typical households. The initiative is strategically designed to strengthen the brand's connection with coffee-loving renters, a rapidly expanding demographic across the country.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has achieved an unprecedented financial milestone, becoming the first person in history to see his net worth exceed $500 billion. His fortune briefly touched $500.1 billion on Wednesday afternoon, solidifying his status as the world's richest person, considerably surpassing rivals in the global tech sector. This remarkable wealth accumulation is primarily attributed to the soaring valuations of his various ventures, including the electric car company Tesla, the artificial intelligence startup xAI, and the rocket company SpaceX. Tesla shares alone have risen by over 20% this year, a gain that investors attribute partly to Musk's increased focus on his companies rather than political engagements. Furthermore, Tesla's board has outlined an ambitious pay package for Musk, potentially worth over $1 trillion, contingent on him achieving a series of aggressive growth targets over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Renault is currently engaged in discussions with China’s Chery about a potential collaboration to manufacture cars across South America, specifically targeting Colombia and Argentina. The proposed partnership would provide Chery with strategic access to Renault’s established factory network in these countries, in exchange for Chery’s investment in capital and product design expertise. Initial plans include Chery utilizing Renault’s plant in Envigado, Colombia, for the production of combustion-engine vehicles, with the majority being rebadged under the Renault brand and a portion sold as Chery vehicles. Additionally, Chery is considering an investment in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault’s Córdoba factory in Argentina, where Renault would serve as the general distributor. While these talks are ongoing and a deal is not yet finalized, the latest discussions indicate that Chery would fully fund these projects, reflecting a more cautious investment approach from Renault’s current CEO.</p>

          <p>Six people were apprehended on Sunday after allegedly trespassing and attempting to hang a banner on one of the iconic "O's" of the Hollywood sign. The group was detained without incident by officers from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) around noon. The specific nature of the banner and the message the group intended to convey remains unclear, though a photograph shared by the LAPD on social media depicted what appeared to be a green-and-white pill capsule as part of the banner, which was not fully visible. City park rangers have subsequently assumed control of the investigation into this incident, with the LAPD referring all further inquiries to their agency, indicating a resolution to the immediate situation but ongoing investigation into motives.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the federal government from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in crucial funding designated for protecting New York City's transportation system from terrorist attacks. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan indicated that the state of New York is "quite likely" to prove its claim that the Trump administration's actions were an improper attempt to punish the city for its non-cooperation with federal deportation programs. The state's lawsuit emphasized that the Rail and Transit Security Grant Program was specifically created after the 9/11 attacks to safeguard transit systems from various threats. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch had previously warned that such cuts would be a "profound mistake" and would significantly jeopardize the city's safety.

          <p>A 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx experienced a partial collapse on Wednesday morning following a boiler room explosion, which tore a gaping hole in the side of the high-rise and caused extensive damage along Alexander Avenue. Astonishingly, despite the severity of the blast and the raining debris, no injuries were reported. Mayor Eric Adams, who visited the scene, confirmed initial reports suggesting the explosion originated in the boiler room, sending shockwaves up the chimney and triggering the collapse. Officials promptly evacuated 38 apartments as a precautionary measure, and comprehensive inspections are now underway to ascertain the structural integrity of the building, with gas services temporarily shut off for the entire complex. This article highlights a critical urban infrastructure incident, fortunately without loss of life, but raising concerns about building safety and maintenance.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders has devised a uniquely inventive method of responding to reporters' questions by literally muting himself, following the promotion of fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel to the team's starting position. When asked about his unchanged No. 3 spot on the depth chart, Sanders, a former college star who played for his father Deion Sanders, smiled broadly and proceeded to offer a voiceless, pantomimed answer. This silent protest comes after critical remarks made by former NFL coach and current analyst Rex Ryan, who had taken issue with Sanders' previous comments about his capabilities relative to other NFL quarterbacks. The incident underscores the intense media scrutiny and pressure faced by young athletes in professional sports, prompting a creative, if unconventional, way to navigate difficult questions without directly engaging.</p>

The Lakers, actively seeking "three-and-D" players to pair with their core, quickly secured LaRavia after his team option was not picked up by the Sacramento Kings. Head coach JJ Redick has expressed high expectations for LaRavia's continued development, praising his commitment and versatility in guarding multiple positions. As a lifelong Lakers fan, LaRavia is now focused on contributing to the organization's relentless pursuit of championships.</p>

          <p>Prudential Hong Kong is strategically expanding its partnerships and accelerating the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) to effectively capture the burgeoning cross-border insurance business, particularly within the dynamic Greater Bay Area. Lawrence Lam, CEO of Prudential Hong Kong, highlighted a significant increase in cross-border hospital claims, which now account for 30% of the total, up from 26% just a year prior. A recent Prudential survey revealed a strong demand from mainland Chinese respondents planning to visit Hong Kong, with 55% intending to purchase critical illness insurance, 40% seeking medical coverage, and 45% interested in savings products. Prudential aims to introduce more medical products to cater to this demand, leveraging AI to enhance service delivery and efficiently penetrate this expanding market, which benefits from the ongoing economic integration efforts across Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland Chinese cities.

He posited that many of these leading stocks are likely to continue their upward trajectory through the end of the year, as fund managers often acquire such winners to favorably present their portfolios to clients. However, Cramer also issued a cautionary note, suggesting that the most substantial gains of the year "may, indeed, have already been made." This article highlighted several companies that saw massive Q3 surges, including AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, and Warner Bros.

          <p>This article offers comprehensive expert guidance on selecting the appropriate cooking oils and effectively debunks several pervasive myths surrounding fats and their nutritional impact. Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge clarifies that commonly maligned sunflower and vegetable oils are, in fact, beneficial due to their low content of unhealthy saturated fats and high levels of healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats, essential for brain and heart health. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, containing virtually no harmful trans fats, while butter can be enjoyed in moderation. The article meticulously explains that extra virgin olive oil, rich in antioxidants, is best suited for salad dressings due to its low smoke point, whereas vegetable or sunflower oils are recommended for deep frying as they withstand higher temperatures without releasing potentially toxic compounds, offering clear, actionable advice for consumers.</p>
