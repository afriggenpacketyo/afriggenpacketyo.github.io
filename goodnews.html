          <p>Trentham Monkey Forest in Staffordshire has announced the birth of three Barbary macaque monkeys, an endangered species with fewer than 8,000 believed to live in the wild. Staff at the sanctuary expressed their delight at the new arrivals, who were discovered during morning feeding rounds. The 60-acre site is home to 140 Barbary macaques, and staff anticipate more births during the ongoing 'baby season.' The park works with organizations to protect wild Barbary macaques and aims to raise awareness about the species' endangered status, contributing to conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational corporations, driven by the potential for cost savings. These deals often involve a 'newco structure,' combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend allows Chinese biotech companies to license their intellectual property as an alternative to selling shares amid depressed valuations. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing deals, reflecting the broader trend of increasing deal numbers and values in this sector.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. This decision follows technical talks between the two nations and is expected to involve a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities. While some restrictions remain on food imports from certain Japanese prefectures, this move signals progress in resolving tensions between the two countries. Japanese fishermen and businesses have welcomed the announcement as a significant milestone, with the expectation that shipments will begin after the completion of the registration process and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, marking the end of one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal signals a potential shift in the U.S. approach to crypto regulation, particularly as the Trump administration aims to foster a more industry-friendly environment, including Binance's deepening ties with World Liberty Financial and expansion in Pakistan.</p>
