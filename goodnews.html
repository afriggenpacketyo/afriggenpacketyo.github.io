          <p>China is positioning itself to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with nearly 60 domestically developed medications currently in clinical trials to compete with popular drugs like Ozempic. The patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, is set to expire in China in 2026, much earlier than in other major markets. This upcoming expiration is expected to pave the way for cheaper generic versions, potentially making these treatments more accessible and affordable for a wider population both within China and globally, challenging the dominance of current market leaders.</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project, aiming to increase its cargo-handling capacity by 50% and accommodate larger vessels. This move comes at a time of significant uncertainty in global trade, with the port experiencing a recent decline in container movement attributed to rising international tariffs. Despite the downturn, port officials express confidence in the long-term necessity of the infrastructure investment to strengthen America's supply chain. The project is expected to create jobs and enhance the port's competitive position.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to multiple charges, including drug trafficking and running a continuing criminal enterprise.

As part of his plea agreement, Guzman Lopez will forfeit $80 million and cooperate with prosecutors, marking a significant development in US efforts to dismantle the powerful drug cartel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting immigration enforcement actions in Southern California that are alleged to be unconstitutional. The ruling found sufficient evidence that agents were stopping individuals based on race, language, or location, rather than reasonable suspicion of an immigration violation, which violates the 4th Amendment. The order prohibits agents from using these factors for detention and mandates that detainees at a specific facility be given access to legal counsel, marking a significant legal challenge to the administration's recent immigration sweeps.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, who is in her first major final. Swiatek, the world number one, brings experience but has historically been less comfortable on grass, while Anisimova plays an aggressive, high-risk style and may feel less pressure as the underdog. The analysis suggests the outcome will depend heavily on which player better manages the nerves of the occasion and executes their game plan, with Swiatek's tactical adjustments on grass being tested against Anisimova's powerful hitting.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is charting a new foreign policy course, emphasizing national sovereignty and an "Australia first" doctrine in an era of rising global tensions. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese is recalibrating relationships with allies and rivals, seeking to act in Australia's direct strategic interest rather than being defined by traditional allegiances. While maintaining the US alliance and the AUKUS pact, this approach signals a more independent and assertive posture on the world stage, particularly in its dealings with both the United States and China.</p>

Once able to communicate, Viraj rapidly advanced from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and graduated from high school. His story is a powerful testament to parental persistence and challenges assumptions about the cognitive abilities of non-speaking autistic individuals.</p>

The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant intentionally uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users, keeping them engaged for longer periods to increase ad exposure and drive e-commerce. The court ruled that the state's claims about the app's dangerous features were specific enough to proceed, marking another instance of a state government targeting a tech company's platform design rather than its user-generated content.</p>
