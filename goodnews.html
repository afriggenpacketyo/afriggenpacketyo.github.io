          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a thaw in relations. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing where the foreign ministers of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and China discussed improving cooperation. Relations between the two countries have been strained due to accusations of harboring the Pakistani Taliban and the deportation of Afghan refugees. The move is aimed at fostering enhanced bilateral cooperation across various sectors, although no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. Optimism surrounds the potential for strengthened regional stability and collaboration.</p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was saved from being cooked at a Rhode Island restaurant after a cook noticed its unusual coloring. The lobster's gold hue is due to a genetic mutation that occurs in only about one in 30 million lobsters. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where it will be displayed for educational purposes. The center's director noted that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange lobsters, and boiling would have turned it red like all cooked lobsters.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has confirmed three new wolf packs in the state's far north, bringing the total to ten. This resurgence of the protected canids is welcomed by conservationists but raises concerns among ranchers, who fear attacks on their livestock. As the wolf population increases, so does the number of cattle depredation incidents, prompting some counties to declare states of emergency. The state is taking steps to address ranchers' concerns, including releasing an online map showing the location of GPS-collared wolves and exploring harsher methods to haze the animals.</p>

          <p>While the UN estimates the world population to be around 8.2 billion, a recent study suggests it could be much higher, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. Although this news might raise concerns about overpopulation, the author argues that anxieties about population size are often rooted in power dynamics and reflect concerns about which lives matter. The author notes that overpopulation fears are nothing new and have historically led to coercive population control measures. However, current approaches focus on women's empowerment and education, leading to declining fertility rates and a projected population peak in the mid-2080s.</p>

          <p>Memory cafes are providing support and camaraderie for people with dementia and their caregivers. These gatherings offer a space for socializing, engaging in activities, and finding community. The cafes are relatively inexpensive and easy to run, making them an important resource as healthcare funding faces potential cuts. Memory cafes distinguish themselves from other programs by including caregivers, addressing the social isolation and distress experienced by both patients and their families. As the population ages and dementia cases rise, memory cafes offer an affordable and valuable form of support.</p>

          <h2>John Healey Expects UK to Spend 3% of GDP on Defence by 2034</h2>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates that the UK will increase its defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2034, and the government is expected to unveil its strategic defence review. While there is confidence that the ambition will be reached, some measures will be unaffordable if the spending level is not reached. The review will warn of new threats with drones and AI, and it will recommend the deployment of digital experts alongside troops. The independent budget watchdog said that meeting the 3% target would cost an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30.</p>
