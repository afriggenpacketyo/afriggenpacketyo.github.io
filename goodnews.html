          <p>The ETF market is poised for significant growth due to an SEC rule change allowing mutual fund managers to offer ETF share classes, potentially doubling the number of ETFs available. While ETFs offer benefits like liquidity and tax efficiency, the surge in new products requires investors to conduct thorough research. Experts advise caution with new strategies, particularly in illiquid asset classes, and highlight the importance of understanding the risks associated with active management. While traditional asset allocation products will likely remain the core of the market, investors should be mindful of potential capacity constraints and liquidity issues with newer, more complex ETFs.

The actions also seek to boost uranium mining and domestic enrichment capacity, while establishing a framework for the Departments of Energy and Defense to construct reactors on federal land.

The agreement to disarm the camps was reached with the Palestinian Authority, with both sides stating that the era of weapons outside Lebanese state authority is over. The Lebanese army does not typically enter the impoverished and overcrowded Palestinian refugee camps, where security is handled by various armed factions.</p>

          <p>New Jersey is holding its gubernatorial elections this year, with hotly contested primaries set for next month, and experts are suggesting the race could be a bellwether for the mood of the country ahead of 2026's critical midterm elections. The Democratic primary features six figures hoping to succeed incumbent and term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy and to keep the governorship blue. Republicans are hoping to flip New Jersey's governorship red -- and point to the closer-than-expected margin between Trump and Harris in 2024 as evidence that it's in reach. Trump has endorsed the Republican front-runner Ciattarelli in the race that the president wrote is being "closely watched by the entire World."</p>

The "No Tax on Tips" provision would eliminate federal income taxes on tips for those earning less than $160,000, while a separate bill passed by the Senate focuses solely on tax breaks for tipped workers. The GOP bill also includes a tax break for overtime pay, but both provisions have restrictions, including a requirement for a Social Security number. Concerns have been raised that the tax breaks may not benefit low-income workers and could lead to employers reclassifying workers as tipped. (not investment advice)</p>
