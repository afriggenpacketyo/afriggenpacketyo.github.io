          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call to discuss tariffs and agreed that their ministers should accelerate negotiations. Ishiba emphasized the need for "win-win" relations and called for the removal of higher U.S. tariffs on Japanese products, such as cars and steel. Trump's spokeswoman described the call as "very good," and Ishiba expressed his desire to meet with Trump at the upcoming G7 summit. The discussion also touched on Japan's potential to create jobs in the U.S. through increased investment, suggesting a cooperative approach to trade relations.</p>

          <p>Global investment advisory Cambridge Associates suggests that global investors are reassessing their portfolios and considering undervalued equities in Hong Kong and mainland China. According to the firm's head of Asia, Aaron Costello, Chinese and Hong Kong stocks are attractively valued and can provide defense amid geopolitical tensions. This sentiment follows Washington and Beijing's agreement to reduce tariffs, which eased some geopolitical risk. Institutional portfolios are starting to shift away from US markets, with Asia benefiting from both relative value and early signs of policy support, which could lead to a surge in global inflows into Chinese stocks (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The SEC has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, signaling a potential shift in the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns, coinciding with efforts from the Trump administration to demonstrate support for the crypto industry. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has also forged ties with World Liberty Financial, a project aiming to be a crypto bank and funneling profits to entities linked to the Trump family (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>After a severe spring season of toxic algae blooms that sickened many sea lions, experts are reporting that the worst of the poisoning is over. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro has seen no new patients with domoic acid poisoning or signs of Pseudo-nitzschia algae in Southern California waters. This year's event pushed the center to its limits, treating over 400 marine animals, including aggressive sea lions attacking people in the water. The center is expanding its facilities and securing research funding to better understand toxic algae blooms and prepare for future events.</p>

          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight dip despite the company reporting quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded expectations, with an 8% year-over-year sales increase. While the company does not provide an annual outlook, leaders discussed the challenges and increased costs associated with tariffs on the earnings call. Unpredictable tariff policies could drive more customers to Costco, known for its competitive prices and bulk discounts, encouraging membership renewals. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales are goods brought in from other countries, with items imported from China representing about 8% of total U.S. sales (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Director Ryan Coogler attended a special screening of his film 'Sinners' in Clarksdale, Mississippi, the town where the movie is set, after a community petition. The film, a supernatural vampire flick set in 1930s Clarksdale, stars Michael B. Jordan as twins and blends drama, action, and music. The event was organized because the town lacks a movie theater, making it difficult for locals to see a film about their hometown. The crowd's enthusiastic response during the screening and the subsequent Q&A highlighted the community's appreciation for Coogler's portrayal of Southern Black culture.</p>

          <p>A court has sided with the California Coastal Commission in a dispute over an offshore oil operation, ordering Sable Offshore Corp. to cease construction or repairs until it obtains official approvals. Sable has denied the commission's authority to oversee upgrades to pipelines, arguing it's only maintaining existing lines. The court upheld a cease and desist order, finding Sable's work falls under the Coastal Act's definition of "development." Sable plans to appeal, while the Coastal Commission hails the ruling as a win for the environment and the rule of law.</p>
