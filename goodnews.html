          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly attributed to higher screening rates following the updated recommendation to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. While experts call the findings promising news, they also caution that screening uptake in this younger demographic remains suboptimal and inequitable across different socioeconomic groups. The research highlights the positive impact of preventive health measures, even as the future of the task force that makes these recommendations is under discussion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the dismissal of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner over a large downward revision of job numbers, experts are clarifying that such revisions are a normal part of the reporting process. Former officials explain that the BLS issues preliminary reports for timeliness and then revises them as more complete survey data becomes available from businesses and households. While the recent 258,000-job downward revision for May and June was unusually large for a non-recessionary period, it is attributed to late reporting from state and local governments and the expiration of pandemic-era subsidies. Experts stress the process is not subject to political manipulation.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a proper headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Known as "Bruce Grit," he was an internationally renowned voice in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, founding several newspapers and associating with figures like Marcus Garvey. Despite his fame, he was not wealthy, and plans for a headstone at his 1924 burial never materialized. Now, through a combination of private and public funding, a black granite headstone has been created to honor his legacy and his dedication to preserving Black history.</p>

He highlights that teenagers and adults with disabilities often face the indignity of being changed on bathroom floors or in cars, if they can go out at all. As the Michigan chair for the national organization Changing Spaces USA, Taylor is working with officials to install accessible facilities, like a model in Commerce Township that can support 1,000 lbs.

          <p>Following a downturn prompted by a weak labor report, the stock market rebounded strongly on Monday, a move CNBC's Jim Cramer attributes to the impressive earnings of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Apple delivered strong quarterly results, showcasing robust growth in areas like cloud infrastructure and AI development, which has bolstered investor confidence. This resilience from the tech sector is seen as the primary driver of the market's recovery, overshadowing concerns about the broader economy and the political controversy surrounding the jobs data. These cash-rich, diversified tech giants continue to prove difficult to beat. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has enacted tighter controls on firearms licensing, a move praised by campaigners like Emma Ambler, whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held gun in 2020. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character referees for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate that police interview partners to check for signs of domestic abuse. The changes also place greater emphasis on an applicant's honesty, making lying on an application a significant factor in determining suitability. These measures are a direct response to weaknesses in the system exposed by several recent mass shootings.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese province of Hainan is positioning itself to become a major medical tourism hub, with plans to attract over 1.5 million domestic medical tourists annually by 2027. The initiative aims to reverse the trend of Chinese citizens seeking medical treatments abroad and will be bolstered by approving new international drugs and medical devices each year. This strategic push coincides with a policy change in South Korea, a top competitor, which will remove value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery services starting next year. Hainan's medical tourism zone has already seen a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in visitors.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service advises that people coming off weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro should receive structured support for at least a year to prevent weight regain. Health assessment body NICE warns that weight management is a long-term process, and experience shows patients often regain a significant portion of lost weight after stopping treatment. The advice encourages creating sustainable behavioral habits, self-monitoring, and utilizing support from communities and family. This comes as an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these jabs, with around 240,000 expected to be offered Mounjaro on the NHS.</p>
