          <p>A recent study in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry suggests that lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of dementia, stroke, and late-life depression. The study found that at least 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia cases, and 35% of late-life depression cases are attributable to modifiable risk factors. Dr. Sanjula Singh, the study's lead author, noted that individuals who have experienced a stroke are more prone to developing depression or dementia, and vice versa. The article highlights the top three practices recommended by experts to stave off these brain conditions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of brain health and lifestyle. </p>

          <h2>Child Therapists Identify Top Six Worries of Children That Parents Often Miss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 10:32:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Child and family therapists have identified the top six worries of children that parents often don't realize: social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. Children are increasingly anxious about fitting in, comparing themselves to others online, and dealing with disruptions to their routines. Over-scheduling and lack of unstructured playtime can lead to chronic stress, while inconsistency in caregiving and conflicting signals from adults can cause discomfort. Trauma, even from seemingly small incidents, can deeply affect a child's sense of safety. The article provides coping strategies for parents to help their children manage these worries, such as naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, and scheduling a 'worry window'.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second term as Australian Prime Minister, marking the first time in 21 years that an Australian leader has won consecutive three-year terms. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging the Labor Party's historic win. Energy policy and the rising cost of living were key issues in the campaign. Albanese highlighted his government's improved relations with China, which led to the removal of trade barriers. The election occurred against a backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with millions of households experiencing food insecurity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to resume broadcasting after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order by President Trump that aimed to dismantle the broadcaster. The court's decision allows VoA staff to return to the office and restart programming. However, the court ruling upheld the freeze on congressionally approved funds for other publicly funded broadcasters like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia, which has already led to staffing and content cuts. The US Agency for Global Media, which oversees VoA, has enjoyed bipartisan support due to its role in promoting democracy and US interests by reaching millions in countries with limited independent press.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage has hailed Reform UK's gains in recent elections as "unprecedented," claiming it marks "the end of two-party politics." The party has secured control of 10 local councils, won two mayoral races, and gained a fifth MP in a by-election. These wins have come at the expense of both Labour and Conservative parties. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged that people were not yet feeling the benefits of a Labour government, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pledged to make her party a "credible" alternative once again. The results were worse than Conservatives had feared, with the party losing not only to Reform but also the Liberal Democrats.</p>

          <p>Several German states are considering a ban on smartphones in schools, with one high school in North Rhine-Westphalia already trialing the initiative. Students must leave their smartphones turned off in their schoolbags during the school day. The initiative, called "Smart without your phone", aims to encourage students to pay attention in class and interact more with each other. While Germany's 16 state governments remain reluctant to implement consistent standards, the state of Hesse plans to ban private smartphones in primary schools and, with limited exceptions, in secondary schools. Education researchers suggest that smartphone bans can increase social wellbeing and reduce cyberbullying.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese has secured a second term as Prime Minister of Australia, a victory attributed to voters opting for a known leader amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. Opposition leader Peter Dutton faced a resounding defeat, with his association with some of President Trump‚Äôs messaging and policies hurting his campaign. The election is the first in Australia in which Baby Boomers are outnumbered by younger voters, with both campaigns focusing on policies to help first-home buyers. Albanese's victory speech emphasized Australia's unique approach to global challenges and its independence from overseas influence.</p>

          <p>On National College Decision Day, a growing number of high school seniors are selecting colleges based on cost due to rising tuition and concerns about student debt. This trend has led to a higher percentage of students enrolling in public schools over private ones. With uncertainties about financial aid and changing student loan policies, price is now a major consideration for families. Carlos Marin, a senior at Milby High School, chose the University of Houston-Downtown to avoid room and board expenses. College costs have increased significantly, outpacing inflation, and families are now shouldering a larger portion of these expenses.</p>
