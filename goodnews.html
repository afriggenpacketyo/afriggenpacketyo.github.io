The new office will be responsible for partnerships not only in New Zealand but also in Antarctica and several Pacific Island nations.

As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for Korean companies to enter the US market, particularly in sectors like shipbuilding and semiconductors. While the deal provides some certainty for Seoul, analysts note it negates some benefits of the existing bilateral free trade agreement. The deal also includes a South Korean commitment to purchase $100 billion in US energy products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed AB 379 into law, which increases the penalty for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The new law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. The bill was controversial, with some lawmakers expressing concerns that it could be used to disproportionately target minorities. The law also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines for offenders and non-compliant hoteliers.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced that she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election. In a public statement, Harris explained that after deep reflection, she has decided her public service will not be in elected office for now. This decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest that this leaves the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run, as she plans to remain engaged in national politics.</p>

          <h2>Hotel Tycoon Proposes Alternative Heathrow Airport Expansion Plan</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 20:59:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a rival proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would be cheaper and less disruptive by avoiding the need to divert the M25 motorway. The company estimates its plan would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035. This marks the first time the government has invited competing bids for the long-debated airport expansion project.</p>

          <p>Robinhood has reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating Wall Street expectations with a 45% year-over-year jump in revenue to $989 million. The company's growth was driven by a significant increase in funded customers, which climbed to 26.5 million, and a near doubling of total platform assets to $279 billion. The positive performance reflects the company's expansion into wealth management and success in attracting new clients. The company also teased the upcoming launch of Robinhood Banking, aimed at further integrating customer assets onto its platform.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani caused a moment of concern when he left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning. The team later announced the early exit was due to cramping, alleviating fears of a more serious injury. Ohtani remained in the game as the designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost 5-2. The incident occurred on a hot and humid night, and manager Dave Roberts expressed relief that the issue was not severe, expecting Ohtani to make his next scheduled start.</p>

          <p>The US Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to implement a cut. The decision comes as policymakers weigh the uncertain economic effects of new tariffs, with recent data showing a GDP rebound driven primarily by a sharp drop in imports. While the Fed has signaled a potential rate cut later this year, it is proceeding cautiously due to inflation remaining above its target. The vote was not unanimous, with two members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a rare occurrence.</p>

          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. These powerful waves are typically generated by large, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor, displacing massive volumes of water. While difficult to predict precisely, scientists use deep ocean sensors to detect tsunamis, which can travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water before slowing and growing in height near the shore. Experts stress the importance of heeding all warnings and immediately moving to higher ground, as even small tsunamis are extremely dangerous.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has captured unprecedented images of abundant life in deep-sea trenches in the northwest Pacific. At depths exceeding 9,000 meters, scientists observed thriving communities of creatures, including tube worms and clams, fueled by chemical seeps from the ocean floor rather than sunlight. The findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life in extreme high-pressure, pitch-dark environments. Researchers were amazed by the density of the animal populations, suggesting such chemosynthetic ecosystems may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>
