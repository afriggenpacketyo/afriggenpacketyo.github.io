          <p>The BBC has confirmed that chef and television host Matt Tebbutt will take over from Gregg Wallace as a judge on 'MasterChef: The Professionals.' He will join fellow judges Marcus Wareing and Monica Galetti on the popular cooking competition. Wallace's departure follows an independent inquiry that upheld 45 allegations of misconduct against him, including inappropriate comments and unwelcome physical contact. The controversy also led to the dismissal of fellow host John Torode from the main series over a separate racism allegation, leaving the BBC to find replacements for multiple formats of the show.</p>

          <p>China is planning a planetary defense test mission to demonstrate its ability to protect Earth from potential asteroid impacts. Wu Weiren, the chief designer of the country's lunar program, announced the "kinetic impact demonstration mission," which aims to launch within the year. The mission will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away, using an impactor spacecraft to strike it and an observer craft to measure the resulting orbital deflection. The goal is to test the feasibility of altering an asteroid's trajectory by 3 to 5 centimeters, a crucial step in developing global defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>As gold prices reach record highs, driven by economic uncertainty and anticipation of Federal Reserve rate cuts, investors are increasingly turning to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. Financial experts suggest that the most efficient way for individuals to gain exposure is through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than owning physical bullion, which involves higher costs. They generally advise limiting gold allocation to a small fraction, typically under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural phenomenon 'Hamilton' is being re-examined as a filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. Originally celebrated for its progressive, Obama-era optimism, the musical's legacy is now viewed through the lens of a more polarized America. Critics and academics increasingly question its celebratory portrayal of the Founding Fathers, pointing out their roles in upholding slavery and their elitist views. The show that once united political figures is now seen by some as a reflection of a more hopeful, but perhaps naive, moment in American history.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church is set to canonize Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, making him the first Millennial saint. Acutis, an avid computer user, gained posthumous fame for creating a website to document Eucharistic miracles, blending modern technology with deep, traditional faith. The Vatican has embraced his story, presenting him as a relatable example of piety for a digital generation. His rapid path to sainthood reflects his appeal to both Catholics seeking a modern faith and those drawn to the more supernatural aspects of the religion.</p>

          <p>The US Open women's final will feature a compelling matchup between world number one Aryna Sabalenka and American Amanda Anisimova, with both players seeking a significant victory. Sabalenka, the defending champion, is looking to overcome defeats in this year's Australian and French Open finals. Anisimova is aiming for redemption after a crushing 6-0 6-0 loss in the Wimbledon final just two months ago. The final will be a test of mental fortitude as much as physical skill, as both powerful hitters have shown vulnerability under pressure on the sport's biggest stages.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, the celebrated all-Black 369th Infantry Regiment of World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor from Congress. Despite their renowned bravery and 191 days in combat, the unit faced intense discrimination and was largely ignored by US military leadership at the time. The long-overdue recognition comes amid a broader national conversation about how American history is remembered, particularly regarding the contributions and struggles of African Americans. The medal will be housed at the Smithsonian Institution for display and research.</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is causing a significant shift in consumer behavior, directly impacting the snack and beverage industries. Recent studies show that users of these drugs reduce their overall grocery spending and are actively replacing ultra-processed foods with healthier options like vegetables and high-protein meals. This trend is forcing retailers and food manufacturers to adapt their strategies, reformulate products, and adjust supply chains to cater to a growing customer base with changing appetites and increased health consciousness, especially during events like NFL tailgates.</p>

          <p>A Chinese activist named Qi Hong successfully staged a rare public protest by remotely activating a projector to display anti-government slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing. After months of meticulous planning, he executed the demonstration from the United Kingdom, where he had fled with his family to seek safety. The messages called for an end to the Communist Party's rule and were targeted at university students. Qi Hong also set up cameras to record the police response, turning the state's surveillance apparatus back on itself in a bold act of defiance.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the Trump administration has taken a roughly 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the U.S. government its largest single shareholder. This action, converting previous grants into equity, is part of a strategic effort to bolster domestic manufacturing of advanced microchips and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly Taiwan's TSMC. The investment aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness in artificial intelligence and strengthen national security by ensuring a domestic supply chain for critical technology. While the government will not have voting rights, the move signifies a deep commitment to revitalizing a key American industry.</p>

          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, the nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne and the only male heir of his generation, the event has renewed public debate over Japan's male-only succession laws. These rules exclude the emperor's only child, Princess Aiko, from succeeding her father. With a shrinking imperial family, Hisahito's ceremony underscores the pressing concerns about the future continuity of the world's oldest continuous monarchy.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is being held amidst attacks from Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has condemned the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity." This criticism echoes the rhetoric of the Nazi party, which shut down the school in 1933 after labeling its work "degenerate art." Despite the political pressure, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its celebration, focusing on modern materials and sustainable design.</p>

          <p>A personal essay explores the experience of becoming a Buffalo Bills fan, discovering that supporting the team is synonymous with embracing the city of Buffalo itself. The author describes how the team's underdog narrative—marked by near-misses and resilient hope—mirrors the city's own story of quiet revival after economic hardship. This shared identity fosters an intensely loyal and positive community, known as the 'Bills Mafia,' which provides a powerful sense of belonging and home. For many, the team represents the hardworking and tough spirit of the city, creating a bond that transcends geography.</p>
