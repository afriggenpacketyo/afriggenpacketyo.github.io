          <p>Independent candidate Catherine Connolly has decisively won Ireland's presidential election, securing over 64% of the vote to become the successor to Michael D. Higgins. The 68-year-old lawmaker from Galway, endorsed by left-wing parties like Sinn Fein, ran on a platform of "peace" and "neutrality," and has been a vocal critic of U.S. and EU foreign policy. The election was marked by a low voter turnout and a high number of spoiled ballots, which some analysts interpret as a protest against mainstream parties and their handling of issues like immigration. The article notes that prominent figures like Conor McGregor, who was convicted in a civil sexual assault case, had previously considered running.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping personally led the drafting team for the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan, according to state media reports. This direct involvement highlights his centralized authority and decisive role in shaping China's future economic and social development. The plan was reportedly formulated based on extensive investigations during Xi's national tours throughout the year, with multiple revisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation. This hands-on approach signifies the immense personal influence Xi wields over the nation's strategic direction, ensuring his vision is deeply embedded in long-term policy.</p>

          <p>In its debut season, San Diego FC has made MLS history by setting records for the most wins and points by an expansion team, securing the Western Conference's top seed for the playoffs. The club's success is built on a philosophy that combines star players like Hirving "Chucky" Lozano with a strong team-first mentality and a focus on data analytics. A cornerstone of their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, which develops homegrown talent from both San Diego and Tijuana, reflecting the region's unique cross-border culture. As they aim to become the first expansion team since 1998 to win the MLS Cup, the team embodies a blend of high-level recruitment and deep community integration.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Northwestern Polytechnical University have developed a bionic jellyfish robot designed for stealthy underwater surveillance and environmental monitoring. Described as an "underwater phantom," the device mimics the appearance and movement of a real jellyfish, allowing for near-silent operation with low power consumption. Made from a transparent hydrogel material, the compact robot is suited for tasks such as covertly observing fragile marine ecosystems and inspecting underwater structures without causing disruption. This innovation represents a significant advancement in biomimetic robotics, offering new capabilities for discreet observation in sensitive aquatic environments.</p>

          <p>Rick Senko, who began reselling used items on eBay in 2008 out of financial desperation, has built a wholesale clothing business, Technsports, that generated over $6.5 million in revenue in 2024. Starting by flipping a single cell phone, Senko dedicated himself to learning the resale market, eventually specializing in pre-owned clothing and building strong relationships with suppliers. In 2023, he pivoted from selling individual items to a wholesale model, selling clothes in bulk to other resellers. Senko's story illustrates a journey from being a single father with no money to becoming a top eBay seller and successful entrepreneur through relentless work ethic and market savvy.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain, asserts that the concept of work-life balance is non-existent for entrepreneurs aiming to build a successful business from scratch. He argues that creating something from nothing requires an intense, all-consuming work ethic, reflecting on his own journey of working relentlessly to grow his company into a billion-dollar brand. Liautaud, who sold his majority stake in the company for a valuation around $3.5 billion, believes that true entrepreneurial success demands a "grinder" mentality, a perspective shared by other notable figures like Bill Gates and Elon Musk in their early careers.</p>

          <p>A vibrant 1943 portrait by Pablo Picasso of his muse and partner, Dora Maar, has been sold for €32 million (about $37 million) at the Drouot auction house in Paris. Titled "Bust of a Woman with a Flowered Hat," the painting had been in a private family collection since 1944 and was hidden from public view for over 80 years. The artwork captures Maar at a painful closing point in her relationship with Picasso, and its vivid colors were a revelation, as it had previously only been known through a black-and-white photograph. The sale price surpassed expectations and marked the highest amount paid for an artwork at a French auction this year.</p>

          <p>Two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach advises parents against attending their children's sports practices, arguing it helps kids develop resilience and internal motivation. The former soccer star suggests that a parent's presence can cause children to "outsource their motivation," making them either nervous or overly focused on impressing their parents rather than playing freely. By allowing children to interact with coaches and teammates independently, parents can help them become self-starters who learn from mistakes and take risks without pressure. This approach, she believes, fosters key traits that contribute to becoming successful and self-reliant adults.</p>

          <p>A renewed interest in gold prospecting is emerging in California, with locals finding gold dust, flakes, and nuggets in rivers as gold prices have surged over 50% in the past year. Some prospectors, like Manny Goza, have found significant success, with Goza claiming to have paid for his house with gold he found. While striking it rich often depends on luck, even amateur prospectors can earn a modest daily income. This trend coincides with prominent financial figures like Ray Dalio and Jamie Dimon advocating for gold as a crucial portfolio diversifier and a hedge against inflation and market volatility.

          <p>A family in West Virginia discovered that four of their six children share a rare brain condition known as Chiari malformation, where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter's constant crying and developmental delays led to the diagnosis and a successful surgery that transformed her personality. Subsequently, three of her older sisters, who had been suffering from various unexplained symptoms, were also diagnosed with the condition and underwent successful treatments. The case is highly unusual, as while the condition can have a genetic link, it is rare for it to manifest in so many siblings, and the family credits the surgeons with giving them their children's lives back.</p>

The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medications by a law enforcement agency worldwide, with an estimated value over £250,000. Authorities confiscated thousands of unlicensed and potentially deadly pens of Retatrutide and Tirzepatide, along with raw ingredients and manufacturing equipment. Officials warned the public about the severe health risks of purchasing such untested and unauthorized products online, which they say enriches criminal networks.</p>

His walk revealed a diverse tapestry of history, culture, and community, from historical treaty sites to vibrant local eateries and small businesses. Dr. Meals' prescription for others is to escape their own neighborhoods, venture forth on foot, and make their own life-enriching discoveries by being curious, fit, and engaged with their surroundings.</p>
