          <p>Dave Nadig, a financial futurist, predicts the ETF market will surge with potentially 3,000 new launches due to SEC rule changes allowing mutual funds to offer ETF share classes. He estimates the number of ETFs could jump from 4,000 to over 7,000, placing an 'enormous burden' on investors to navigate the options. While ETFs offer benefits like liquidity and low fees, Nadig advises caution with new, complex strategies like private credit ETFs, citing limited demand and SEC concerns. He also notes that investors should consider whether the ETF structure is suitable for illiquid assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders aimed at reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and expediting the deployment of new nuclear reactors. The orders call for a 'total and complete reform' of the NRC, mandating decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months and potentially leading to staff reductions. The administration aims to create a regulatory framework for building nuclear reactors on federal land, bypassing direct NRC oversight for national security purposes. These actions also seek to boost uranium mining and domestic enrichment capacity, alongside accelerating reactor testing at national laboratories.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields retreated from recent highs after President Trump suggested imposing a 50% tariff on the European Union and a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 2 basis points to 5.041%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped 4 basis points to 4.515%. These moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S.' credit rating. Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Financial Group criticized the departure from free trade principles, citing the negative impact of tariffs on businesses and consumers.</p>
