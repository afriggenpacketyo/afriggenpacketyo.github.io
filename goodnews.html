          <p>Following Karen Read's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe, her parents expressed relief and a focus on returning to normalcy after more than two years of a life-changing ordeal. Bill and Janet Read credited their daughter's strength and determination, referring to her as the "fifth lawyer" in the case, for her involvement in pursuing every angle of the investigation. They acknowledged the hurtful and misogynistic comments directed at Karen during the trial and expressed a commitment to speaking out and helping others in need moving forward, hoping the question of who is responsible for O'Keefe's death will one day be answered. The family of John O'Keefe has expressed their disappointment with the verdict, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with soaring rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., which operates Densetsu no Sutadonya eateries, has recently opened ramen noodle restaurants to diversify its offerings due to rice prices tripling in recent years. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also bolstering its ramen noodle business, aiming to balance ingredient costs with non-rice options as consumers seek alternatives at supermarkets, with sales of frozen udon noodles and related products experiencing growth. The shift reflects consumers' sensitivity to price increases and the industry's adaptation to maintain affordability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mysterious human skull discovered in the 1930s, known as "dragon man," has been identified as a Denisovan after initial attempts to extract DNA failed, according to recent studies. Researchers successfully extracted genetic material from dental calculus, calcified dental plaque, to compare it to previous samples. The findings revealed that the "dragon man" was not a new species but rather an intact Denisovan specimen, which are closely related to Neanderthals and coexisted with modern-day humans. The skull was originally found by a Chinese laborer and kept hidden to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Japanese army before being donated to a museum in 2018.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order.

Upon his release, Khalil criticized the administration's efforts to dehumanize immigrants and expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son.

          <p>Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil was released on bail after being detained for more than three months, following a ruling that he was not a flight risk or threat.

While in detention, Khalil graduated from Columbia, with his wife accepting his diploma on his behalf during the ceremony. The White House criticized the judge's decision and maintains that Khalil engaged in fraud and misrepresentation, vowing to appeal the ruling and remove him from the United States.</p>

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery involving strange signals detected from below the ice in Antarctica, which seem to defy the laws of physics. The signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, using NASA's Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna experiment. The anomalous radio waves came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, but the radio waves should have been absorbed by the rock. Follow-up observations and analyses with other instruments have not been able to find the same signals.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, the appropriateness of wearing shorts in the office remains a contentious issue, with evolving dress codes and varying opinions among stylists and companies. While some companies have relaxed dress codes, allowing employees to dress comfortably and professionally, others maintain expectations of formal attire, particularly in client-facing roles. Stylists emphasize the importance of context and monitoring colleagues' attire to determine whether shorts are appropriate, while also advising against overly casual styles like beach or sports shorts. Some individuals find shorts more comfortable and practical than traditional office wear, highlighting the ongoing negotiation between comfort and professionalism in the workplace.</p>

          <p>Romance and fantasy books, particularly the "romantasy" blend, are experiencing a surge in popularity, driving UK fiction revenue above ¬£1 billion for the first time. The rise of BookTok, a TikTok reading community, has fueled the genre's success, with young women driving sales and embracing tropes like "enemies to lovers" and high "spice levels." While attitudes toward romance are improving, some readers and industry experts believe sexism still prevents the genre from mainstream recognition. The growing commercial success of romance is prompting publishers to invest more seriously in the genre, but critical appraisal remains lacking, with broadsheets rarely reviewing romance books.</p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is heavily influenced by President Trump's demands for increased defense spending by European allies. Secretary General Mark Rutte has prioritized a commitment to higher defense spending to avoid conflict with the US, although compromises and disagreements on trade, Russia, and the Middle East are expected. The summit's brevity and reduced agenda are seen as attempts to hide divisions and cater to Trump's preferences. Despite the focus on defense spending, challenges remain in reaching and defining spending targets, with some nations struggling to meet existing goals.</p>
