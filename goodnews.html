          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has designated the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, citing incompatibility with the country's free democratic order. The decision, based on a comprehensive review, has sparked controversy, with some US officials like Marco Rubio criticizing it as "tyranny in disguise." The German Foreign Office defended the move, emphasizing the lessons learned from history regarding right-wing extremism. The AfD, which came second in recent federal elections, denounced the classification as politically motivated, while acting Interior Minister Nancy Faeser asserted the agency's decision was unbiased and based on factual evidence, and this article goes into the circumstances surrounding the decision and the debate it has caused. Relevant context: The AfD's rise in popularity has been accompanied by scandals and controversial rhetoric, including embracing the term "remigration."</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and other Trump administration officials were reportedly using a modified version of the Signal app for communication, despite previous concerns about the app's security. A photo taken during a Cabinet meeting revealed Waltz using an app that appeared to be a "fork" of Signal from TeleMessage, a company that archives messages. While the White House maintains that Signal is an approved app, the use of a modified version raises privacy concerns, as Signal's spokesperson stated they cannot guarantee the privacy or security of unofficial versions.

Farage has emphasized gaining a foothold in town halls as a key step towards the next general election, but this article also raises questions about how the party intends to wield its newly acquired local powers.</p>
