          <p>Following their successful passing of the Federal Reserve's annual stress test, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have announced substantial increases to their quarterly dividends. Goldman Sachs raised its payout by 33% to $4 per share, while Wells Fargo boosted its dividend by 12.5% to 45 cents per share, leading to a rise in their respective stock prices. These hikes are part of a broader trend, with many other major companies also increasing their dividends in 2025. Such increases are typically seen as a sign of management's confidence in future cash flow and profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former NFL player Corey Parchman has released a new book, "IVF Playbook for Men," to address the stigma and lack of resources for men experiencing infertility. In an interview, Parchman shared his personal struggles with his wife through five IVF cycles, describing the shock of his diagnosis and the feeling of being the "weakest link." He emphasized the importance of open communication and creating a supportive space for partners. The book aims to be a resource for men, encouraging them to be more vulnerable and open about their feelings during a process where women often bear the primary focus.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is escalating its efforts to combat the New World screwworm fly, a pest whose flesh-eating larvae pose a severe threat to the nation's livestock, wildlife, and pets. The strategy involves breeding billions of male flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them from aircraft over Mexico and southern Texas. These sterile males then mate with wild females, whose eggs consequently do not hatch, causing the population to collapse over time. This sterile insect technique successfully eradicated the pest from the U.S. decades ago and is being revived to counter its recent reappearance.</p>

          <p>British university student and world number 733 Ollie Tarvet saw his dream run at Wimbledon come to an end in a second-round match against two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz. Despite the straight-sets loss, the 21-year-old qualifier delivered an entertaining performance on Centre Court, earning praise from Alcaraz for his potential and fighting spirit. Tarvet, who had to win three qualifying matches to enter the main draw, created eleven break point opportunities against the world number two.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) outages and a projected record-breaking Fourth of July travel period, airlines and pilots are highlighting their extensive training and redundant systems designed to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from early in their careers to handle communication loss by using backup radio frequencies, a text-based messaging system, and specific transponder codes to signal an issue. Furthermore, all airliners are equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that autonomously communicates with other aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. While these measures maintain safety, ATC disruptions inevitably lead to significant flight delays.</p>

          <p>This article presents the case for investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, during July 2025, highlighting its role as a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy. It notes that gold offers investors direct control and can be a hedge against inflation, with prices predicted to rise later in the year. The piece emphasizes the ease of purchasing gold from various retailers and online dealers. It also points out that investors can enter the market at a lower price point by buying fractional gold, allowing for portfolio diversification without a massive initial outlay.

          <p>Ether (ETH) and stocks associated with the cryptocurrency experienced gains on Wednesday, driven by renewed market enthusiasm for stablecoins and the tokenization of real-world assets. Companies that have shifted their treasury strategies to include ETH, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies, saw significant stock jumps. The trend is fueled by the Ethereum network's capability to support smart contracts, making it a foundational platform for issuing digital representations of assets. This renewed interest comes as major platforms like Robinhood expand trading of tokenized U.S. stocks in Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology indicates that using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for hormone therapy increases the risk of breast cancer in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that for women who have had a hysterectomy and can take estrogen alone, the risk of breast cancer is actually reduced. This research refines the understanding of hormone replacement therapy, which has been a subject of evolving science since a controversial early 2000s study. The findings underscore the importance of tailoring treatment based on individual health factors.</p>
