        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers on Nantucket are pioneering a new method to fight Lyme disease by genetically engineering the local white-footed mouse population. The project, led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, aims to make the mice, which are the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, immune to the disease. By introducing Lyme-immune mice into the wild, scientists hope to break the transmission cycle where ticks become infected after biting mice. This novel approach of "heritable immunization" is being developed with community input to ensure ecological safety and public support before any potential release.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing the "fearless pursuit of truth" and open debate. Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat the self-censorship and lack of intellectual diversity they see on other campuses. Operating from a modest downtown Austin location, UATX currently offers free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. The curriculum emphasizes Western civilization and seminar-style classes under a "Chatham House Rule" to encourage candid discussion.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies undertakes a remarkable 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico for the winter. These butterflies can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs by suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the arduous journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation, which involves internal compasses and circadian clocks. Conservation efforts are underway to protect this phenomenon, as the monarch population has declined significantly due to habitat loss, particularly the milkweed plants essential for their reproduction.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded their regular-season home schedule with a 3-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants, despite a strong performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan. A late-inning bullpen collapse allowed the Giants to score three runs in the eighth inning, securing their victory. The game marked a historic milestone for the Dodgers, as they surpassed 4 million in home attendance for the first time, a franchise record. Despite the loss, the team is poised to enter the National League playoffs next week with a high probability of hosting postseason games.</p>

          <p>While the path from an MBA program to a venture capital career remains viable, its prominence is declining as the industry evolves. New research indicates a drop in the percentage of venture professionals with MBAs compared to the early 2000s. This shift is driven by the growing importance of sectors like AI and hardware, where deep technical expertise is valued more than traditional business credentials. Consequently, VC firms are now more frequently recruiting talent directly from tech companies like OpenAI and SpaceX, rather than relying solely on elite business schools for new hires.

          <p>Apple has taken full control of the core chips in its new iPhone Air, introducing the custom A19 Pro processor, N1 wireless chip, and C1X modem. The A19 Pro features a significant architectural change, adding neural accelerators to each GPU core to boost on-device artificial intelligence capabilities and enhance user privacy. This move allows Apple to phase out components previously supplied by companies like Broadcom and Qualcomm, giving it greater control over performance and power efficiency. The company's strategy prioritizes processing AI workloads directly on the device rather than in the cloud. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal could be finalized soon, which would place the popular social media app under American control.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two spectacular defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the National League wildcard race. In the fifth inning, Young robbed Brett Baty of a hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this in the ninth inning with a leaping catch at the fence to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez. The loss was costly for the Mets, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final wildcard spot.</p>

In an interview with the BBC, Lee described such a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the stalled long-term goal of complete denuclearization, noting that Pyongyang is producing numerous new weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim, who he believes share a degree of mutual trust, could resume negotiations.

          <p>Manchester City's 1-1 draw with Arsenal featured an uncharacteristically defensive tactical shift from manager Pep Guardiola, which nearly secured a victory. After taking an early lead through Erling Haaland, City ceded possession and adopted a deep, 5-5-0 formation in the second half, a move commentators compared to the style of José Mourinho. This strategy frustrated Arsenal until a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli salvaged a point for the home side. The result is seen as a win for league leaders Liverpool, as both title contenders dropped crucial points in the tight race.</p>

His teammate and title rival, Lando Norris, managed to finish seventh but only gained six points, leading to questions about a missed opportunity to significantly close the championship gap. Norris attributed his result to a compromised qualifying session, where he started seventh after a risky decision to run first on a damp track. Meanwhile, Max Verstappen's dominant victory for Red Bull has put him back in the conversation for the drivers' championship.</p>
