          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser but will face other major restrictions. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta barred the company from entering into exclusive contracts that make its search engine the default choice on browsers and smartphones, a practice central to the Justice Department's case. While Google must also share some search data, the ruling was seen as a partial victory for the tech giant, which avoided the most severe penalties sought by the government. The company has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price edged higher, reclaiming the $110,000 level, while the broader stock market experienced a sell-off and gold surged to a new record high above $3,500. The market volatility was fueled by concerns over the legality of President Trump's global tariffs. Market strategists suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some safe-haven demand, its performance has been tempered by a significant rotation of investment into Ethereum, causing it to lag behind gold's traditional role as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

          <h2>President Trump Confirms U.S. Space Command Headquarters Will Relocate to Huntsville, Alabama</h2>

          <p>President Trump has announced his decision to move the headquarters of U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama. This reverses a Biden administration decision to keep the headquarters in Colorado, which was made over concerns about military readiness. Trump, who first selected Huntsville during his initial term, argued that the move to Alabama's "Rocket City" will bring jobs, investment, and strengthen national defense. The decision carries political undertones, relocating a major military command from a state that has become increasingly Democratic to a reliably Republican one.</p>

          <p>Contrary to prevalent narratives of rampant violence, Chicago is experiencing a dramatic downturn in violent crime this year. Robberies have reportedly fallen by a third compared to the previous year, and the city is on pace to record its lowest murder rate in over a decade. The article notes that while President Trump has described the city as a "disaster," the statistical reality shows a significant improvement. It also points out that violence remains concentrated in specific neighborhoods, with most of the city, including tourist areas, being largely safe.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using military troops for domestic law enforcement activities in California, ruling that the deployment of National Guard and active-duty Marines in Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. This law restricts the use of the military for civilian policing. The ruling is a setback for the administration's strategy of deploying troops to U.S. cities to address crime and immigration enforcement. The White House criticized the decision, calling the judge's action rogue and vowing to appeal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air Lease Corp., a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a group of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at about $28.2 billion including debt, marks a significant consolidation in the airplane-renting sector. The industry, which owns over half the world's passenger jets, has seen record rental rates recently due to aircraft shortages, but now faces potential shifts as airlines rethink their capacity needs.
