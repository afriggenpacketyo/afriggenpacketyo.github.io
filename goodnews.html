          <p>Minnesota's Democratic Governor, Tim Walz, has announced he will seek a rare third consecutive term, a feat never before accomplished in the state's history. His campaign is highlighting progressive legislative victories, including codified abortion rights and legalized marijuana, while promising to address gun violence and government fraud. However, Walz faces significant political headwinds, including polling that suggests half of Minnesotans oppose his run and intense scrutiny over his administration's handling of the massive "Feeding Our Future" fraud scandal, which has become a central issue for his Republican opponents.</p>

          <p>Google's Gemini has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT and signaling a significant gain in the consumer artificial intelligence race.

This increased traction has also boosted investor confidence, helping Google's parent company, Alphabet, join the exclusive group of firms with a $3 trillion market valuation.</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality were reported in parts of Washington state after strong winds stirred up old volcanic ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. This phenomenon, known as ash resuspension, occurs during dry and windy conditions, which are currently affecting the drought-stricken area. Both the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service have confirmed that the event is not due to new volcanic activity, but they still advise caution as the airborne ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell to their lowest point since late 2022, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.13%. The decline comes as investors anticipate an interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, a move that is widely expected by markets. However, some analysts caution that the market may have already priced in the cut, and long-term rates might not be significantly impacted, or could even rise, after the Fed's official announcement.

By embedding AI principles into national education strategies, governments can improve productivity and ensure their workforce can migrate from low-value tasks to higher-level work, fostering broad economic growth.</p>

Since 2021, the percentage of high-income households shopping at budget retailers has risen from 20% to nearly 28%, according to data from GlobalData Retail. This trend is driven by persistent inflation eroding the financial cushions of even wealthier consumers, who are now seeking better value on groceries and household essentials.

A framework deal has reportedly been reached that would see an investor consortium, including Oracle and Silver Lake, own about 80% of the new U.S.-based entity. The extension prevents the Department of Justice from enforcing a national security law that would have effectively banned the popular app in the U.S. while the final terms of the complex deal are negotiated.</p>
