          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, former President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. In a social media post, Trump stated that all parties determined a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, which he claimed often fails to hold. This announcement came after a phone call with Zelenskyy and European leaders. The upcoming discussion in Washington D.C. is intended to finalize details of a proposal to end the war, with a potential follow-up meeting with Putin if successful. This development shifts the focus from achieving an immediate ceasefire to negotiating a comprehensive peace treaty.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 06:00:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an innovative method to recycle discarded cigarette butts into asphalt, addressing both pollution and infrastructure needs. Cigarette filters, the most littered item globally, can be cleaned, shredded, and mixed with wax to create pellets that reinforce road materials. This process not only diverts toxic waste from the environment but also produces asphalt that is more resistant to heavy traffic and temperature fluctuations. The technique also lowers the energy required for asphalt production, reducing emissions. A city in Slovakia has already begun implementing this technology, demonstrating a practical application that turns a widespread pollutant into a valuable resource for building more durable roads.</p>

          <p>The Old Fiddler's Convention in Galax, Virginia, is celebrating its 89th year, continuing its legacy as the oldest Bluegrass and "Old Time" music festival in the United States. The six-day event draws approximately 30,000 musicians and fans, featuring competitions for various traditional instruments and folk singing. Experts highlight the festival's role in preserving a unique American musical tradition that blends European, African, and Native American influences. Despite challenges like declining post-pandemic attendance, the convention focuses on fostering young talent through youth competitions and informal jam sessions, ensuring the cultural heritage of mountain music is passed on to the next generation.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Young Chimpanzees Learn Communication Styles Primarily from Their Mothers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda suggests that young chimps acquire their combined vocal and gestural communication patterns through social learning from their mothers, not through genetics. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line exhibited similar communication styles, while no such pattern was found with paternal relatives. This finding mirrors how human infants learn from their primary caregivers. The study proposes that this capacity for socially learned communication is an ancient trait that may date back at least six to eight million years to the last common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, offering insights into the evolution of human language.</p>

          <p>A female black bear, known for her extensive 100-mile journey across Southern California, has been spotted with three cubs in the Santa Monica Mountains, a rare occurrence for the area. Tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, the bear's travels have taken her through numerous communities and across major freeways since May 2024. Her recent settling in the Topanga area to raise her cubs marks a significant event, as she and her offspring are the first known black bear family to reside in the mountain range in recent years. This development has prompted interest and some concern among local residents who are unaccustomed to having ursine neighbors.</p>

          <p>Teen Line, a hotline based in Century City and run by trained teenage volunteers, is providing critical mental health support for young people as government funding for such services is being reduced. The service offers a peer-to-peer connection for youth in crisis, fielding thousands of calls, texts, and emails annually on issues ranging from self-harm to relationship problems. This resource has become increasingly vital as the Trump administration has cut federal grants for school psychologists and proposed reductions to programs that fund mental healthcare. The teen volunteers provide a unique form of support, offering an empathetic ear from someone who understands the specific pressures of being a teenager today.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last living recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War II, has passed away at the age of 105. The Aberdeen native was awarded Britain's highest military honor for his valor during a 1944 mission where he piloted a Catalina flying boat. Despite sustaining 72 separate injuries from heavy enemy fire, he successfully destroyed a German U-boat and safely flew his damaged aircraft and injured crew back to base. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions as a matter of duty. His passing marks the end of an era for the 181 individuals decorated with the Victoria Cross during the conflict.</p>

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic suspending official events, she continued to run the course on her own. Her determination and love for the community aspect of the event have made her a celebrated figure, with even Olympians like Dame Kelly Holmes running alongside her.</p>

          <p>Global music superstar Bad Bunny's 30-concert residency in San Juan has become a major cultural event, drawing thousands of Puerto Ricans back to the island from abroad.

          <p>Investors from China have become the dominant force in Greece's investor residency program, significantly impacting the real estate market in Athens. Known as the "golden visa," the scheme grants residency to non-EU citizens who invest in property. As of June 2025, Chinese citizens accounted for nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of those who have renewed their visas. This influx of investment has led to Chinese buyers acquiring thousands of apartments across the Greek capital. The trend highlights a major shift in the city's property ownership and demographics, driven by a single popular immigration policy.</p>

          <p>China's space agency has successfully completed a crucial engine test for its new-generation Long March-10 rocket, a key milestone in its plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test confirmed that the rocket's 21 YF-100K engines can operate in sync, providing the necessary thrust for a lunar mission. The superheavy launcher is designed to carry a crewed spacecraft and a lunar lander into orbit in separate launches. The two vehicles will then rendezvous before attempting a moon landing. This progress keeps China on track to achieve its ambitious goal of a crewed lunar landing within the decade.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win came at a critical time, as the team had been struggling and had just lost star player Max Muncy to the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, supported by solid defense and just enough offense to build a narrow lead. The Dodgers' often-unreliable bullpen managed to protect the lead through the final innings, providing a much-needed morale boost and halting the team's recent slide.</p>
