          <p>The 10-year Treasury note yield jumped after a stronger-than-expected jobs report in April, easing concerns about the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs.

The market is now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's May meeting, with expectations for unchanged interest rates until July. The article notes that investors were encouraged by the possibility of trade talks, but significant hurdles remain, as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods stand at 145%.</p>
