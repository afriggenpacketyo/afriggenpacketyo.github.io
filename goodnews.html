          <p>Workday's stock experienced a 9% increase after Elliott Investment Management announced a $2 billion stake in the company. Workday also revealed a multi-year plan to improve its operating model and capital allocation, which Elliott believes will lead to significant long-term value creation. Elliott praised Workday's CEO, CFO, and team for their progress, highlighting the company's potential for growth and customer retention. Workday recently announced its intent to acquire Paradox, an AI software company for recruiting, but the terms of the deal were not disclosed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During President Trump's state visit to the UK, fashion choices have become a form of diplomacy. Melania Trump wore a wide-brimmed purple hat and a Dior suit, which some analysts interpreted as a message of support for her husband's agenda and American support for Europe. The Princess of Wales wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat, and analysts noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband, the Prince of Wales, who wore a burgundy tie. These sartorial choices highlight the importance of symbolism and messaging in international relations.</p>

Eli Lilly plans to seek approval for orforglipron for Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026, but analysts say it's too early to establish a clear winner in the pill space, as there is no data comparing Eli Lillly's drug with a higher dose of Novo Nordisk's pill in patients with obesity.
