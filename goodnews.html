          <p>Scientists have created an electronic tattoo, or "e-tattoo," designed to track brainwaves and eye movements to measure mental workload in high-stress professions. The e-tattoo, temporarily attached to the forehead, uses electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) technology. This device offers a more cost-effective and compact alternative to bulky EEG and EOG machines. The study involved participants performing tasks of varying difficulty while brainwave activity was monitored, revealing shifts corresponding to mental workload. The device is currently a lab prototype and requires further development before commercialization.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and those aged 12-64 with health conditions increasing their risk from the coronavirus. This vaccine uses a lower dose by refining its immune target and is not intended as a replacement for Moderna's existing vaccine. The approval is based on a study comparing mNexspike to Moderna's original vaccine, finding it safe and at least as effective. This decision comes amid changes to CDC recommendations for children's COVID-19 vaccinations and canceled funding for Moderna's flu vaccine development.</p>
