          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is warning Senate Republicans against cutting Medicaid benefits in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," aligning himself with Trump's stance on preserving the healthcare program. Hawley argues that Republicans should heed Trump's call to avoid Medicaid benefit cuts and prevent rural hospital closures. While Hawley supports measures to eliminate waste and fraud in Medicaid, he opposes stripping benefits from working individuals who rely on the program for healthcare access because they cannot afford private insurance. Hawley's position could influence the fate of the legislative package in the Senate.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended a temporary restraining order on President Trump's ban prohibiting foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S. until next Monday. Harvard's lawyers argued that the proclamation violates its First Amendment rights and is outside the authority of the executive branch, claiming it is retaliation against the institution. The government argued that it does not "trust" Harvard to vet and monitor foreign students.

The analysts foresee a resurgence in AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) during the fourth quarter, anticipating that the company will have largely absorbed the $800 million in expenses stemming from new U.S. licensing regulations on semiconductor exports to China. The unveiling of AMD's next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, has also contributed to the positive outlook.

          <p>A LendingTree survey found that 67% of newlyweds took on debt to pay for their wedding. Experts advise that if having a certain kind of wedding is a high priority, taking on some debt can be acceptable if approached carefully. Using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer is a wise option if you can repay the debt within the promotional period. A personal line of credit with a lower interest rate may also be a suitable choice for larger expenses. (not investment advice)</p>
