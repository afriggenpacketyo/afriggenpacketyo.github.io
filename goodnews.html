          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a financial aid package exceeding $10 billion to support U.S. farmers, particularly soybean producers, who have been significantly impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett confirmed ongoing discussions, promising substantial measures soon to address the current oversupply and lack of Chinese purchases. President Trump previously suggested that revenue from tariffs could fund this relief, aiming to sustain farmers until trade policies yield positive outcomes. This initiative highlights the administration's efforts to mitigate economic strain on a crucial agricultural sector, acknowledging the challenges faced during harvest season with full silos.</p>

          <p>For the first time, renewable energy, including nuclear power, collectively surpassed coal as the world's leading source of electricity in the first half of this year, according to Ember. While global electricity demand grew, strong solar and wind expansion met 100% of this increase, even slightly reducing fossil fuel use. This article notes a mixed global picture, with developing countries like China leading the clean energy charge, while some developed nations increased reliance on fossil fuels. Despite regional disparities, experts consider this a "crucial turning point" in the global energy transition.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets are expected to open mixed, tracking Wall Street's gains driven by a tech rally. This surge was fueled by a significant deal between OpenAI and AMD, which saw AMD's shares skyrocket nearly 24% and boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to new records. Investors in Asia will be closely watching regional chip stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, saw a slight decline. Chinese, Hong Kong, and South Korean markets remain closed for holidays, impacting the overall regional picture. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmacies in England are experiencing "major issues" as a significant number of patients, up to half at some sites, are being turned away from Covid jab appointments due to tightened eligibility criteria. Only those aged 75 and older, or younger patients with weakened immune systems, are now offered free boosters. This article highlights that the confusion, stemming from patients missing eligibility information on the NHS booking system, has led to upset, anger, and even abuse directed at pharmacy staff. NHS England has since updated the website wording to clarify the new criteria.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is bullish on Take-Two Interactive, arguing its "scarcity value" will drive stock growth following the privatization of competitors Activision and Electronic Arts. Take-Two, known for the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is now the only major publicly-traded American pure-play video game company. The article notes the company's strong performance, beating Wall Street estimates and raising its full-year forecast for net bookings, with significant growth in GTA Online and NBA 2K. Cramer suggests that while "Grand Theft Auto VI" may face delays, any stock dip could be a buying opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parking in Los Angeles is set to become more expensive, with city leaders approving a 50-cent per hour increase for its 35,000 metered spaces and extending paid-parking hours.

          <p>China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the WTO, which granted special and differential treatment, is viewed as a strategic retreat rather than capitulation. This article argues that by conceding these privileges, China removes a key talking point for the U.S. and E.U. while losing little substance, as it had already conceded some benefits. The move aligns with Mao Zedong's theory of protracted war, emphasizing a strategic defensive to reposition politically and outlast stronger adversaries. Beijing aims to strengthen its alignment with the Global South by claiming peer status with genuinely developing nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Investor Brad Gerstner cautioned that OpenAI's deals with AMD and Nvidia are announcements, not deployments, emphasizing that "the best chips will win" in the competitive AI landscape. This article highlights that these deals underscore the intensifying AI arms race and the persistent "compute scarcity" despite efforts to increase supply. Experts view it as further validation of AI's critical role in the geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China, especially with Chinese rivals like DeepSeek innovating with domestically made chips. OpenAI's President stressed the industry's need to collaborate to meet massive AI service demand. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation began when a victim tracked a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow.
