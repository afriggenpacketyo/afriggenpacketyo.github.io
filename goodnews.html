          <p>Target is expanding its next-day delivery service to 35 additional metro areas by the end of October, with plans to add 20 more in 2026, aiming to enhance its competitiveness against rivals like Amazon and Walmart. This move is part of a broader strategy to revitalize the company amidst declining sales and a recent 21% drop in net income. The expansion leverages Target's existing network of over 1,900 stores for fulfillment, shifting towards a more localized, market-based approach to increase delivery speed without sacrificing profitability. The initiative is a key part of the company's effort to drive growth under its incoming CEO.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly will invest $5 billion to construct a new manufacturing facility in Virginia, aimed at increasing production of targeted cancer drugs and other advanced treatments. This plant is the first of four new domestic facilities the company plans to build, part of a larger strategy to re-shore production in response to potential tariffs and favorable tax conditions in the U.S. The Virginia site will specialize in creating active ingredients for complex medicines like antibody drug conjugates, enhancing the company's domestic capacity for its growing pipeline. The project is expected to create over 650 new jobs and 1,800 construction positions in the region.</p>

          <p>India and the European Union are intensifying efforts to finalize a free trade agreement (FTA) by the end of the year, driven by a shifting global landscape and U.S. tariff pressures. For India, the deal offers crucial tariff-free access for its exports, while the EU aims to diversify supply chains and strengthen its influence in the Indo-Pacific. Negotiations, which resumed in 2022 after a decade-long pause, are now in their final stages, with both sides expressing optimism about reaching a balanced agreement. Key remaining challenges include resolving issues around agricultural tariffs, market access for automobiles, and the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Firm Stance on TikTok Ban Spurred China to Negotiate, Says Treasury Secretary</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Trump's readiness to allow a complete ban of TikTok in the U.S. was the critical factor that motivated China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that while the commercial terms of a deal had been settled for months, negotiations stalled after Trump's tariff announcements in April. The President's unwavering position on prioritizing national security over the deal itself ultimately "turned the tide," leading to the current agreement being finalized. This development highlights the administration's hardline negotiating tactics in its economic and security disputes with China, leveraging the app's popularity as a point of pressure.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Navy Reserve Ensign Eugene E. Mandeberg, a 23-year-old pilot from Detroit, have been identified nearly 80 years after he was killed in action. Mandeberg's aircraft was shot down over Tokyo on August 15, 1945, the very day Japan's surrender was announced, officially ending World War II. His remains were recovered in 1946 but could not be identified at the time and were interred as an Unknown at the Manila American Cemetery. Through modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency successfully confirmed his identity, allowing for his burial in Michigan this month.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) from recent years begin to mature, savers face a new landscape of lower interest rates. Financial experts advise account holders to be proactive during the grace period before their CDs automatically roll over, as current rates are significantly lower than the 5% yields previously common. While automatic rollovers offer convenience, savers should compare rates from different institutions to ensure they are getting a competitive return. It is also a good time to reassess financial goals and consider whether other options, such as high-yield savings accounts or investments, might be more suitable for the funds.

Kirby attributes United's success to customer loyalty driven by investments in its product, network, and technology, such as updated cabin interiors and amenities. While rivals are growing more cautiously, United's domestic capacity is set to increase by 5.7% in 2025. Kirby also reiterated his belief that the ultra-low-cost carrier model in the U.S. is failing, pointing to the struggles of competitors like Spirit Airlines.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has voiced support for President Trump's suggestion to move from quarterly to semiannual corporate earnings reports, arguing it would benefit investors and public markets. The proposal aims to encourage long-term strategic thinking by company executives and reduce the compliance costs that have contributed to a decline in the number of publicly listed companies. While the move would align U.S. markets with practices in the UK and EU, some investor groups have raised concerns that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency and inadequately protect their interests.

The research also highlighted a significant demographic shift in the user base, which was initially male-dominated but had become more likely to be female by June 2025.
