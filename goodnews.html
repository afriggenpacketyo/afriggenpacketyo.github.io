          <p>Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) has reinforced his stance against violence, following his criticism of the chaos in Los Angeles, by issuing a "DO" and "DO NOT" list. Fetterman emphasized the importance of winning arguments, protesting peacefully, and organizing to win elections, while explicitly condemning looting, arson, and assaulting law enforcement. His statement was supported by Senator Dave McCormick (R-PA) and Representative Paul Gosar (R-AZ), signaling bipartisan agreement on the need to denounce destructive behavior. Fetterman's earlier remarks highlighted that his party loses moral authority when it fails to condemn violence.</p>

          <p>China plans to remove tariffs on all products from most African nations, granting them duty-free access to the world's largest consumer market. The measure was announced at a meeting in China with African ministers, affiliated with the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Representatives from China and African nations accused the United States of disrupting the global economic and trade order. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would provide more convenience for the least developed countries in Africa to export to China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of restaurateurs in Los Angeles is embracing a more modest business model, focusing on a single location or a few establishments rather than pursuing large-scale expansion. These independent owner-operators prioritize direct engagement with customers and employees, seeking gratification through local connections and comfort. To improve their chances of success, they avoid high-rent spaces, operate multiple concepts from shared locations, and actively work the room. While the restaurant industry faces challenges such as changing consumer preferences and economic pressures, these owners are adapting by downsizing, partnering up, and selling their wares wholesale.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember John Lee publicly addressed allegations from the L.A. Ethics Commission regarding a 2017 Las Vegas trip with his former boss, Mitch Englander, and several businessmen. Lee insisted he paid for his share of the trip, denying that he accepted gifts in violation of city ethics laws. The Ethics Commission accuses Lee of accepting free hotel rooms, poker chips, and food from a businessman and a developer during the trip, as well as helping Englander backdate checks to repay the businessman who comped the hotel rooms. Lee's attorneys have attempted to block the case, arguing the statute of limitations has expired, but the hearing has concluded, and a recommendation is expected.</p>

          <p>A group of 105 South Korean citizens is suing former President Yoon Suk Yeol for emotional damages related to his declaration of martial law on December 3, which sent special forces soldiers to occupy the National Assembly. The lawsuit demands compensation of 100,000 won ($73) for each plaintiff, alleging that Yoon's actions violated their basic rights and inflicted mental harm. The attorney leading the suit, Lee Gum-gyu, previously helped oust Presidents Park Geun-hye and Yoon from office. The civil suit is largely symbolic, representing a final rebuke of Yoon and a reflection of the fear felt by many South Koreans due to the declaration.</p>

          <p>Brian Wilson's unreleased rap song, "Smart Girls," was intended to be a centerpiece of his Sire Records album "Sweet Insanity," but contributed to the album's shelving. Wilson aimed to create a song that uplifted women, contrasting with the negative portrayals in many rap songs at the time. The song was produced by hip-hop producer Matt Dike, and though Wilson initially believed it would be a hit, the album was ultimately rejected by Sire. Despite its flaws, "Smart Girls" highlights Wilson's openness to rap and his willingness to collaborate with hip-hop artists.</p>
