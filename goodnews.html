          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:11:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has named former biotech executive and Stanford professor George Tidmarsh as its new top drug regulator. He will lead the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), a crucial division responsible for reviewing new drug applications. This appointment comes amid significant changes at the Department of Health and Human Services under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has been skeptical of vaccines and pursued staff cuts. Tidmarsh's industry background is seen as a potential reassurance for pharmaceutical companies, though his past criticisms of certain regulatory decisions suggest he may adopt a more stringent approach.</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to attract more customers as diners become more frugal due to economic pressures. The company reported a 3.4% increase in U.S. same-store sales, attributing the growth to successful promotions and new products like its stuffed crust pizza. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while the restaurant industry faces headwinds, Domino's can gain market share by offering compelling value, which has successfully drawn customers across all income levels. Despite this sales growth, the company's overall earnings missed expectations due to a charge related to its China licensee. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Federal Student Loan Borrowing Limits for College Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average annual cost of college in the U.S. exceeding $38,000, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections and flexible requirements. However, these government-backed loans have strict annual and lifetime borrowing limits that vary based on dependency status, year in school, and whether the student is an undergraduate or graduate. For instance, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, which often falls short of total attendance costs. When federal loans are insufficient, students may turn to private loans, which can offer lower interest rates but typically require credit checks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to go public on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming a leading institutional investment vehicle for the cryptocurrency ether. Backed by a $645 million anchor investment, the firm plans to differentiate itself from other crypto treasury companies by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that supports the Ethereum network's operations. Co-founder Andrew Keys argues that this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as staking provides a dividend-like return that is not available through simply holding the coin or investing in current ETFs. The move comes as institutional interest in ether grows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental and physical health issues like anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Studies show that this behavioral addiction can be as difficult to overcome as smoking, with apps and websites designed to be engaging and escapist. Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to reduce dependency, including creating physical distance from the device, turning off notifications, and setting the screen to black-and-white to make it less rewarding. For severe cases, therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can help address the root causes of the addiction.</p>

This sentiment comes as Apple faces challenges to its existing model, such as the potential loss of its $20 billion search agreement with Google due to an antitrust case.

His extradition is a major event, marking the first time an Ecuadorian citizen has been sent directly from Ecuador to the U.S. to face charges.
