          <p>The White House has detailed a plan to restructure TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture, aiming to address national security concerns. Under this framework, software company Oracle will manage the platform's security from top to bottom, including oversight of its content recommendation algorithm. While administration officials express confidence that China has approved the deal, Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement has been finalized. The move is intended to prevent a full ban of the popular social media app for its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel-Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian activist who has been imprisoned for most of the last decade. Abdel-Fattah became a symbol of political prisoners in the country following his involvement in the 2011 uprising. The pardon, which also included five other individuals, came after repeated calls for his release from the United Nations and the British government. This decision follows a recent court ruling that removed Abdel-Fattah from Egypt's terrorism list, citing a lack of evidence linking him to the Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official clarified that the preliminary deal to preserve TikTok in the U.S. will not involve the federal government taking an equity stake or a "golden share" in the new entity. The arrangement will establish TikTok's U.S. operations as a new joint venture with a majority-American board of directors and security oversight provided by tech giant Oracle. The official expressed confidence that China has approved the framework, which is designed to address national security concerns about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order backing the deal and extending the deadline for a potential ban.</p>

          <p>Meta's new AI-powered smart glasses are being adopted by the blind and visually impaired community as a tool to enhance daily independence. The technology can connect to apps like "Be My Eyes," which links users with volunteers for real-time assistance, and uses optical character recognition to read text from menus, signs, and mail aloud. While users like para-athlete Emeline Lakrout find the glasses make daily tasks quicker and easier, the technology is still a work in progress, with some limitations in functionality and battery life. Advocates agree the glasses are a significant step forward but emphasize they do not replace the need for traditional skills and human support.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Leads to Lower Monthly Payments on Large Mortgages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 11:41:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to a nearly three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction offers significant savings for borrowers, particularly those with large loans; for example, a $1 million mortgage now has a principal and interest payment about $600 lower per month compared to rates earlier in the year. The article details how these lower rates can translate into over $200,000 in total interest savings over the life of the loan. The shift also presents potential benefits for current homeowners considering refinancing their mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle startup Telo has clarified why its compact MT1 electric truck will not be offered with a gasoline-powered range extender or a hybrid powertrain. The company explained that its primary goal is to "shrink the mobility footprint," and adding an internal combustion engine would compromise the vehicle's unique, compact design. An engine would add weight, take up valuable space intended for features like a lockable cargo tunnel, and complicate the vehicle's engineering and safety structures. Telo is focusing on creating a specialized urban vehicle rather than trying to appeal to the broadest possible market with mass-appeal features.</p>

Over 22,000 people reported feeling the quake, which prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing systemwide delays.

Palla, who previously managed the railway's more successful regional transport division, will oversee a massive, multi-billion euro renovation plan to upgrade the severely worn-out network.
