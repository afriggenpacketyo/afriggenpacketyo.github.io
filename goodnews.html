          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities will receive up to $30,000 per year. Democrats argue the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to benefit wealthier students already in private schools. Abbott, however, asserts the bill empowers parents to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have passed a bill aimed at providing relief to condominium owners facing rising costs in aging buildings, a response to strict requirements imposed after the 2021 Surfside collapse. The new law pushes back deadlines for structural integrity inspections and allows condo associations a two-year grace period for fully funding reserves. It also allows associations to secure loans for repairs with member approval. The goal is to balance safety concerns with the financial impact on condo owners, especially in older buildings.</p>

          <p>An election is set to determine whether Boca Chica Village in Texas will be incorporated as the new municipality of Starbase, largely dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. The majority of eligible voters are SpaceX employees, and the incorporation would establish a local government with control over planning and taxation. Nearby residents have opposed the measure, citing environmental concerns. If approved, Starbase would be a Type C city, allowing it to levy property taxes and potentially control access to local beaches during rocket launches.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located in Hawaii, has recorded a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists hope this instrument will help predict potentially damaging solar storms in the future. The telescope, situated on the HaleakalƒÅ volcano in Maui, captured the image during technical testing. Sunspots, areas of intense magnetic activity, can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections that impact Earth's radio communications and electrical grids.</p>
