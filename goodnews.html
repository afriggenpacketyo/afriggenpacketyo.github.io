          <p>For individuals with $10,000 to save, both high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts currently offer highly competitive interest rates, making either a strong choice over traditional savings. With top rates around 4.30% for high-yield savings and 4.32% for money market accounts, the difference in earnings over a year is minimal, approximately $2. Both account types feature variable rates that may change with market conditions. The article suggests that the decision between the two is less about earnings and more about personal preference, as both significantly outperform standard savings options.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For Americans struggling with debt, forgiveness or settlement can be a viable path to financial relief, particularly for certain types of unsecured debt. The article outlines that credit card debt, personal loans, and medical bills are often the most negotiable, as creditors prefer recovering a portion of the owed amount to risking a total loss. Buy now, pay later plans and payday loans are more challenging to settle due to their structure and the aggressive tactics of some lenders. Successful debt settlement typically requires demonstrating genuine financial hardship and having a lump sum available for payment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coterra Energy has decided not to reduce its oil rig count, a reversal from its earlier plans to shift capital toward natural gas due to fears of a tariff-driven recession. This move signals renewed confidence in oil markets and the broader economic outlook, as the company will maintain its nine oil rigs in the Permian Basin. While this keeps capital expenditures at the higher end of guidance, it may alleviate concerns about meeting long-term oil production growth targets. The company is also proceeding with plans to increase activity in the natural gas-focused Marcellus Shale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At Glastonbury Festival, the Strummerville stage serves as a lasting tribute to the late Joe Strummer, frontman of The Clash. Run by his widow, Lucinda Tait, the intimate area is centered around a campfire, recreating the communal vibe Strummer himself fostered at the festival in the 1990s. The stage is dedicated to giving new and lesser-known artists a platform, reflecting Strummer's spirit of championing emerging talent and creating a space for shared ideas. It remains a beloved and unique part of the festival, honoring the deep connection the legendary musician had with Glastonbury and its founder, Michael Eavis.</p>
