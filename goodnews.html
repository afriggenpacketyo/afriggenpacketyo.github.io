        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world could be facing another 'China shock' due to overcapacity in Chinese manufacturing, leading to deflationary pressures globally. Chinese producers are offering steep discounts on exports, causing anxiety in Asia about being swamped by cheap imports. While this situation poses risks to local industries, it could also provide some relief to inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. Economists predict that this influx of low-cost goods may prompt central banks to consider further rate cuts to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is remembered 150 years after his birth as a voice for democracy and a conscience for a nation grappling with Nazi rule. Mann's literary works reflected his life in exile, especially after fleeing Germany in the 1930s, and often incorporated his political views. He used his platform to speak out against authoritarianism and the atrocities of the Nazi regime, even after his German citizenship was revoked. His legacy remains as an example of courage and steadfastness in the face of fascism. </p>

          <p>India's central bank has implemented a substantial interest rate cut, lowering its benchmark policy rate to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. The decision, exceeding market expectations, was driven by softening inflation and slower-than-desired growth amid global uncertainty. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate, it acknowledged potential risks from weather-related issues and evolving tariff concerns. Given the significant rate cut, the central bank indicated limited room for further monetary policy support and shifted its stance to neutral. (not investment advice)</p>

The study emphasizes the need for workers to adapt to new skills rather than fearing job losses due to AI. </p>

The author highlights how Journalism didn't rush to the front but waited for the right moment to surge ahead and win. The essay suggests that in a world focused on speed, there's value in knowing when to move with purpose and precision. Journalism is now headed to the Belmont Stakes, a race that will test its ability to navigate chaos and emerge victorious. </p>
