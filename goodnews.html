          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, particularly Japan, saw gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation over the weekend, following a national election defeat. The Nikkei 225 rose 1.5%, and the Topix reached a record high, with investors eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae. Takaichi, known for advocating deregulation and opposing interest rate hikes, is seen by some as a candidate to drive growth. The Japanese yen weakened, and government bond yields continued to rise amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty, pointing to a period of extended political uncertainty for Japan.

The Shenzhen-based company also launched Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, aiming for "robotic butlers" within five years. Despite AI for robots lagging behind other generative AI advancements, the company is generating revenue and plans for an IPO next year. (not investment advice)</p>

Alcaraz, now the world No. 1, expressed his joy at achieving this goal, emphasizing his consistent high-level play throughout the tournament.

          <h2>China-US Study Reveals Mars Possesses Unexpected Solid Inner Core</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 22:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic data from NASA’s InSight lander, has discovered that Mars possesses a solid inner core, approximately 600km in radius. This finding is significant because Mars, unlike Earth, was not expected to have cooled fast enough to form such a core. The presence of a solid inner core, similar in proportion to Earth's, revives the debate about whether Earth was the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This discovery provides crucial insights into planetary formation and evolution, challenging previous assumptions about the Red Planet's internal structure.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested two men in connection with a brazen wedding theft in Glendale, where a gift box containing approximately $60,000 in cash and checks was stolen. Armean Shirehjini is suspected of taking the box, while Andranik Avetisyan was identified as the getaway driver. Surveillance video, showing a well-dressed man casually taking the box, helped police identify the suspects within five days. During the arrest, firearms and drugs were seized, and about $10,000 in cash and 26 checks were recovered. The incident, which caused distress to the newlyweds, remains under investigation regarding the motive and whether similar crimes were committed.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a four-set match, but the event was notably impacted by President Trump's attendance. The match began late due to enhanced security, causing long lines for ticketholders, and Trump received a mixed reception of cheers and boos. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly advised broadcasters to mute crowd reactions to the president, an action that drew criticism. Trump's appearance, alongside Rolex CEO Jean-Frederic Dufour, occurred weeks after he imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss products, adding a political dimension to the sporting event.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a "last warning" to Hamas, urging the militant group to accept a deal to release hostages from Gaza, stating that Israel has accepted his terms. Hamas later confirmed receiving ceasefire ideas from the US through mediators and is discussing them, reiterating its demand for an end to the war and complete Israeli withdrawal. Trump expressed optimism for a deal soon, believing all hostages would be returned. This development follows reports of a new ceasefire proposal from Trump, which Israel is reportedly "seriously considering," aiming to secure hostage release in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and a truce.</p>

          <p>Charlotte Robinson, 29, experienced the "biggest shock of her life" when she unexpectedly gave birth to her son, Henry, in a football club toilet, having been unaware she was pregnant. Cryptic pregnancies, where mothers are unaware until labor, affect about one in 2,500 births. Robinson reported no unusual symptoms, attributing hip pain to a previous birth. An off-duty paramedic assisted until an ambulance arrived, and the couple, now parents to a new son named Henry James in memory of a family friend, describe the event as surreal but amazing.</p>

          <p>Linebacker Nate Landman, a new team captain for the Los Angeles Rams, secured a 14-9 season-opening victory over the Houston Texans with a critical forced fumble in the final minutes. Landman's "punch-out" separated the ball from a Texans running back, leading to a recovery by Braden Fiske and sealing the win. This defensive effort, which also included an interception and multiple sacks, compensated for an offense that still needs fine-tuning, despite quarterback Matthew Stafford reaching over 60,000 career passing yards. Coach Sean McVay praised Landman's intentional play, highlighting the team's ability to find a way to win.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles' Recreation and Parks Commission has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for a million dollars, aiming to restore it for its 2026 centennial. This "crown jewel" of the park, where Walt Disney was inspired to create Disneyland, closed in 2022 after its previous operator died. The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds, requires significant repairs as it currently cannot be moved by hand. Its acquisition is part of a broader park restoration project slated for completion before the 2028 Olympic Games, with hopes of reopening the beloved attraction soon.</p>

While US equities attracted significant capital previously, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now allocating evenly between US and international markets. Asia-Pacific is seen as offering substantial stimulus potential, real competition in tech, and more favorable valuations compared to expensive US stocks.

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, and parts of Europe and Africa, witnessed a "blood moon" during a total lunar eclipse on Sunday night. This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The red color is due to sunlight reflecting and scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with blue wavelengths dispersing more easily. This celestial event, which has captivated humans for millennia, offered a spectacular visual display, although the Americas missed out on the total eclipse.</p>
