          <h2>Millions of Bees Escape After Truck Overturns in Washington State</h2>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a commercial truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities urged the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away from the scene, especially those allergic to bee stings. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to re-hive as many bees as possible and locate their queen bee. The road was closed for about 24 hours to facilitate the bee recovery, and authorities have since stated that most bees should have returned to their hives. Initial reports of 250 million bees escaping were corrected following assistance from a beekeeper at the scene.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a volatile week, influenced by President Trump's trade policy announcements and strong earnings reports from key companies. The S&P 500 closed flat on Friday but gained for the week and month, driven by positive momentum earlier in the week following Trump's delay of tariffs on the European Union. Nvidia stood out with better-than-expected earnings and guidance, while Salesforce faced criticism for its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge came in cooler than expected, but concerns about future tariff impacts remain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults offers five simple rules for parenting, emphasizing instincts, culture, and individual needs. The rules include trusting parental instincts over influencers, following cultural traditions, understanding each child's unique interests, focusing on enjoyment rather than rigid development, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist emphasizes that children need love and attention, and that parents should prioritize joy and playfulness in their approach to raising kids.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris. The article suggests that a recent rule change aimed at restricting front wing flexing had minimal impact on McLaren's performance. Piastri's victory marks the largest margin for a pole-sitter this season, with Verstappen in third. Norris acknowledged errors in his final run, while Verstappen struggled with Turn One throughout the session.</p>
