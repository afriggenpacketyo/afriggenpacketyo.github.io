          <h2>Warm Weather in June Provides Modest Boost to UK Retail Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 03:55:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's retail sales volumes saw a 0.9% increase in June, a rebound driven primarily by hot weather, according to the Office for National Statistics. The sunny conditions led to higher supermarket sales, particularly of drinks, and increased fuel purchases as more people traveled. This rise followed a significant 2.8% drop in May, and while positive, the rebound was smaller than some economists had anticipated. The data suggests that overall retail spending momentum has slowed, aligning with weaker consumer confidence and expectations of lackluster economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Euro 2025 final, this article analyzes the critical factors that could decide the championship match between England and Spain. It suggests England could exploit Spain's high defensive line, similar to Germany's strategy in the semi-final, by using their dynamic forwards and strong hold-up play from Alessia Russo. The analysis also highlights the need for England to disrupt Spain's talented midfield, particularly by limiting service to pivot player Patri Guijarro. The piece concludes by noting that while Spain will likely dominate possession, England is well-suited to be a significant threat in transition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's visit to his Scottish golf resorts provides a key opportunity for the U.K. to resolve outstanding issues in its recent trade agreement with the U.S. While a deal with a 10% baseline tariff is in place, commitments to remove the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum remain pending. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to meet with Trump to discuss these points, with potential for a trade-off involving the UK's digital services tax, which Washington opposes. Finalizing these details is seen as crucial for strengthening U.S.-UK economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With an August 1st deadline looming before U.S. tariffs are set to increase, India appears unfazed by the pressure to finalize a trade deal. Analysts suggest that Washington has a strategic interest in securing an agreement, viewing India as a crucial partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India's position is further strengthened by its multi-alignment strategy, which includes a recent trade pact with the U.K. and ongoing talks with other nations. This diversification provides India with significant leverage in its negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a free trade agreement (FTA) projected to increase their bilateral trade by over $34 billion annually in the long term. The deal, finalized after three years of intense negotiations, will slash tariffs on a wide range of goods, including British scotch whisky and automobiles, and Indian textiles and agricultural products. Under the agreement, 99% of Indian goods will eventually enter the U.K. tariff-free, while duties on 92% of U.K. exports to India will be reduced or eliminated. The pact is seen as a strategic win for both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon against Reinier de Ridder, nine months after suffering a severe jaw injury where his bottom teeth were caved in. In an interview, Whittaker downplayed the severity of the initial injury but described the process of resetting the teeth as intensely painful. The damage ultimately required surgery to remove several teeth and install permanent implants, a procedure he says has significantly improved his quality of life. Now driven by a desire to be a role model for his children, Whittaker is preparing for his first fight with his new teeth.</p>

          <p>Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham has stated there is "no need" to expand the powers of the video assistant referee (VAR) system in football. His comments come amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider widening VAR's scope to include decisions on corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham argued that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the flow of the game. While the FA, which holds a vote on IFAB, would consider any formal proposal, its current position is to oppose further expansion of the technology's use.</p>

The article praises "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" for its refreshing 1960s aesthetic and self-contained story that doesn't rely on prior MCU knowledge. It also highlights "Cloud," a psychological thriller from Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa about an online reseller whose life spirals into paranoia and violence. Additionally, the roundup examines Giovanni Tortorici's frustrating but faithful adolescent drama "Diciannove" and Michael Winterbottom's historical thriller "Shoshana."</p>

          <p>In a UK first, individuals in Wales with conditions like coeliac disease will receive debit-style cards pre-loaded with money to purchase gluten-free food. This new system, launching later this year, offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining food through pharmacy prescriptions. The Welsh government aims to "de-medicalise" the process, giving people more choice and flexibility at supermarkets and shops. While the move is welcomed, some participants from a pilot program noted that the allotted amount only "scratches the surface" of the higher costs associated with a necessary gluten-free diet.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have signed a new treaty formalizing a 50-year commitment to the AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine pact, which also includes the United States. This move aims to reinforce the trilateral security agreement, particularly as Washington has signaled some uncertainty about its long-term role. The treaty is expected to support both nations' submarine programs, generate tens of thousands of jobs, and potentially deliver up to £20 billion in British exports. The partnership is described as crucial for shaping collective security in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>A majority of MPs on the UK's influential Foreign Affairs Select Committee have called for the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state. In a new report, Labour and Liberal Democrat members argued that statehood is an "inalienable right" that should not be conditional on a final peace settlement. However, their Conservative colleagues on the committee dissented, maintaining the government's position that recognition should be part of a broader two-state solution. The call adds to growing pressure on Prime Minister Keir Starmer, especially after France announced its own plans for recognition.</p>
