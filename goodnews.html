        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in western Japan have left for China, as their loan agreement has expired. The departure of the 24-year-old female Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both of whom are also scheduled to return to China next year. The Wakayama zoo had a successful joint breeding program with a Chinese research base since 1994, raising 17 cubs. Thousands of visitors attended a farewell ceremony, marking a potential end to an era of "panda diplomacy" in the region.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Traditional Japanese Diet May Help Reduce Depressive Symptoms</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 20:55:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The findings suggest certain foods in the diet, such as those containing folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin. While researchers say more study is needed, they hope the evidence can inform public health measures aimed at preventing depression in workplaces.</p>

          <p>Police have captured the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Antoine Massey was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 escape, which authorities have called the worst in recent state history, occurred when inmates broke through a faulty cell door and a wall. The incident has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management, while at least 16 people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>A strawberries and cream sandwich, inspired by the popular Japanese "fruit sando," has been launched by the UK supermarket chain M&S. The sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the store's top-selling sandwich shortly after its debut. While fruit sandwiches are a common snack in Japan, often sold in convenience stores and bakeries, this marks one of their first major appearances on UK supermarket shelves. The launch reflects the growing global popularity of the Japanese treat, which recently went viral on social media among Western tourists.</p>

          <p>A science correspondent has highlighted the potential of phage therapy by successfully finding a bacteria-eating virus, or bacteriophage, in a sample from his own toilet. At a University of Southampton lab, the discovered phage was shown to effectively kill a persistent bacterial infection collected from a hospital patient. This century-old science is gaining renewed interest as a potential solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. While research is still in early stages for modern applications, the experiment demonstrates the promise of using these natural viruses to treat incurable superbug infections.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a specific radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate clouds and foliage to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. The initial images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering unprecedented data for scientists. This pioneering technology will help create a global 3D map of forests, enabling more accurate estimates of their role in mitigating climate change and helping authorities monitor illegal logging.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior in Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to reconnect with her classmates after years of social anxiety. She spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 students she had known since elementary school but had grown distant from. Schafer then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from her peers for not having paid more attention to her. Her project served as a powerful gesture of connection, bridging the social gaps that had formed over the years.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked a presidential executive order aimed at punishing an elite law firm, declaring it unconstitutional. The ruling against the order targeting Susman Godfrey follows three similar decisions, with judges finding the actions violate the First and Fifth Amendments and represent an assault on the legal system. The series of executive orders has targeted prominent law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the administration. While some firms have made deals to avoid being targeted, the consistent judicial rebukes represent a significant check on executive power.</p>

Director General Rafael Grossi stated that while several facilities were severely damaged, the "worst nuclear safety scenario was... avoided." The agency noted that a strike on major facilities like the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant could have had severe consequences beyond Iran's borders. This assessment provides critical context to the aftermath of the military conflict, confirming that a major nuclear disaster was averted despite the attacks.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. This move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to combat the exodus of productions to other locations offering more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and advocates have warned that California has been losing thousands of jobs and was at risk of a major decline. The expanded tax credit is seen as a crucial step to encourage studios to keep filming in Hollywood's home state and support its local economy.</p>
