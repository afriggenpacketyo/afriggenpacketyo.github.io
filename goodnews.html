          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has officially installed Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a historic moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, who was elected in July, succeeds Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, the church's first female leader. His installation comes as the ELCA, like other mainline Protestant denominations, faces challenges of declining membership. Leaders within the church view his election as a significant step, hoping his presence will inspire greater diversity and help the denomination connect more deeply across its congregations.</p>

          <p>WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has acknowledged a need to repair relationships with league players following sharp criticism from Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier. Engelbert stated she was disheartened by the feedback but committed to doing better to ensure players feel valued. She also addressed specific comments, denying she ever said Caitlin Clark was essential for the league's financial success or that "only the losers complain about the refs." The league plans to review officiating with a new committee and is scheduled to begin new collective bargaining agreement talks next week.</p>

          <p>After twenty years of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The 3,000-year-old tomb is one of the largest in the valley and had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led project began. The restoration involved over 260 specialists who worked to preserve the site's exquisite wall paintings and structure. The tomb, first discovered in 1799, contains burial chambers for the king and two queens, though its contents, including the sarcophagus, were looted long ago.</p>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members at a significantly reduced cost. Members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket can purchase a four-week supply for $499, approximately half the typical price. This initiative aims to provide access to authentic versions of the high-demand drugs, as many patients have been turning to cheaper, less regulated compounded alternatives. The move could increase access and demand for these medications, especially since many insurance plans do not cover them.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a Gaza peace and ceasefire proposal outlined by U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. In response, Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe recovery of hostages, stating he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE." The Israeli Prime Minister's office confirmed it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. While the U.S. views the response as positive, some details, such as the decommissioning of weapons, will require further negotiation.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Shows Resilience Amid Government Shutdown as Key Sectors Rally</h2>

          <p>Despite the third day of a federal government shutdown, U.S. stock markets remained strong, with the S&P 500 reaching another record high. The healthcare sector saw a significant relief rally, with shares of Danaher and Eli Lilly surging after President Trump struck a deal to exempt Pfizer from certain tariffs. The technology and utilities sectors also performed well, driven by continued investor interest in artificial intelligence and the power required for data centers. The market's positive performance suggests investors are largely unconcerned by the shutdown, viewing it as a temporary political event. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts suggest that American investors are overly concentrated in domestic assets and should consider increasing their exposure abroad. According to research from ETF.com, this "home bias" is at a historical peak, potentially causing investors to miss out on better value in international markets, particularly in emerging economies. Countries like India are highlighted for their strong demographics and rapid growth, mirroring the economic expansion seen in China over the past two decades, presenting long-term opportunities for diversification.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Salvadoran national Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a discovery request, citing "some evidence that the prosecution... may be vindictive," following Ábrego's successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation. The ruling highlighted public statements by administration officials that seemed to link the charges directly to his legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the political conflict over the administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand cheaper wheat, reduced electricity tariffs, and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to meet these demands and improve public services. The alliance leader urged protesters to disperse, expressing gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues that had fueled the unrest.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have deployed hundreds of additional officers to provide visible reassurance to communities following a deadly attack outside a synagogue. Two men were killed when an attacker drove a car into people before being shot dead by police. The increased police presence is also intended to manage a pro-Palestinian march taking place in the city, an event that officials questioned as being inappropriate so soon after the attack. Six people remain in custody on suspicion of terrorism offenses in connection with the deadly incident.</p>
