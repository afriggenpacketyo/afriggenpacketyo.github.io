          <p>College chaplains are finding themselves in higher demand despite a decline in religious affiliation among young adults. Chaplains are reimagining their roles to provide a sense of belonging, meaning, and purpose to students, often through alternative forms of spirituality and self-care. Many chaplains are more diverse and open-minded than their predecessors, engaging with established religious practices while also embracing alternative forms of spirituality. They offer counseling and guidance on various uncertainties, helping students navigate their personal and spiritual growth.</p>

The negotiations are ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, where announcements around trade and security are expected. While some express concerns about the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards, the minister emphasizes a focus on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders. Discussions also include a youth mobility scheme, but the government insists on maintaining control over migration.</p>

          <p>The publisher of The New York Times, A.G. Sulzberger, discusses the increasing threats to press freedom, both overt in authoritarian societies and subtle in democracies. He highlights concerns about the Trump administration's attacks on the press and the importance of independent journalism in holding power accountable. Sulzberger emphasizes that The Times is committed to reporting the truth without loyalty to any particular team, and that the collapse of the business model, the dominance of tech giants, and a distrustful public all contribute to the challenges facing the news industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Boeing 777X, a new aircraft, does not feature engine chevrons, which are serrated edges on jet engines designed to reduce noise. This decision reflects advancements in engine design that allow for noise reduction without the drawbacks of chevrons, which reduce engine thrust. The GE9X engines on the 777X utilize new nozzle designs, materials, and honeycomb architecture to minimize noise while maintaining thrust. This advancement allows for quieter flights without compromising engine power or fuel efficiency.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the CDC indicates a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, attributed to the widespread availability of a vaccine given during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months decreased by up to 56%, and in newborns, by up to 71%. This trend suggests that the new preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young children from severe illness. Researchers note that older children who did not receive the preventatives had higher hospitalization rates, reinforcing the impact of the vaccine and treatment.</p>
