          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour on personal online activities, such as shopping or property browsing, does not constitute a sackable offense. The judge awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her computer usage. The ruling highlighted that the employer had no clear policy against personal use, the owner also used the work computer for personal reasons, and the dismissal seemed timed to prevent the employee from reaching two years of service, which grants unfair dismissal protection.</p>

          <p>President Trump has approved legislation increasing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change modifies the $10,000 limit established by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had ended a century-long policy of unlimited deductions. The move is particularly significant for taxpayers in high-tax states like New York and California, though it is projected to increase the national debt by over $142 billion over the next decade.

Drawing inspiration from the resilient spirit of pachuco culture, Estrella ran for office to give a voice to parents who felt unheard, particularly in the historically neglected schools of District Five. Since her election, she has focused on supporting undocumented families by helping pass a Safe Schools resolution and partnering with immigration services, bridging the gap between immigrant families and the district.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, holders of maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) are facing a less favorable savings climate. Allowing a CD to simply roll over could lock in a much lower rate, prompting savers to explore other options. Alternatives include high-yield savings accounts, which offer comparable rates with greater flexibility, and money market accounts that combine high interest with checking features. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD to secure fixed earnings against future market declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Broadcom's stock soared after the company announced strong quarterly earnings and revealed it had secured a fourth major customer for its custom AI chips, with orders exceeding $10 billion. CEO Hock Tan's optimistic forecast for fiscal 2026 AI revenue has led analysts to significantly raise their earnings estimates, suggesting the stock may still be reasonably valued despite its recent rally. The new customer is widely believed to be OpenAI, joining a list that reportedly includes Google, Meta, and ByteDance, signaling sustained high demand in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Film Review: 'Love, Brooklyn' Offers a Visually Appealing but Superficial Look at Romance and Gentrification</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Love, Brooklyn" is a visually charming romance that explores themes of gentrification and personal crossroads in the titular New York borough. The movie centers on a blocked writer, played by André Holland, who is navigating relationships with two women while lamenting the changes in his neighborhood. While the film features appealing performances and attractive cinematography, the review suggests its screenplay is too bland and its character development too nonspecific to create a deeply engaging or emotionally resonant story.</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its largest one-day drop since August 2024, in reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report. This decline brings rates to their lowest point since early October and offers potential relief for homebuyers facing high housing prices. A borrower purchasing a $450,000 home could save nearly $170 per month compared to a 7% rate, though it remains uncertain if this drop is substantial enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand, which has recently been sluggish.

          <p>An article in The Atlantic reflects on the shared psychology of political dissidents, drawing parallels between recent pro-democracy protests in Georgia and the historical struggles of Soviet dissenters. Author Lauren Grodstein, after witnessing the Georgian protests, notes a "remarkable ability" among activists to persevere despite the apparent hopelessness of their cause, a trait also observed in those who resisted Soviet repression. This perspective prompts a reflection on the choices faced by citizens in the U.S. today, suggesting that the fight for democracy is a long-term, perhaps lifelong, commitment.</p>

At 17, Gibson became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a #1 Billboard hit, a record she still holds, thanks to her mother's fierce advocacy in a male-dominated industry. Gibson discusses how her mother fought for her creative control and how that independent spirit continues to fuel her career, stating that she is now "thriving more than ever."</p>
