          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy change allowing erotic content on ChatGPT for verified adult users, starting in December. This shift is part of a broader principle to "treat adult users like adults" and follows the implementation of new safety features and age-gating tools to protect minors. The company is relaxing previous restrictions now that it has better tools to mitigate mental health risks associated with the chatbot's content. This move contrasts with Altman's earlier statements suggesting ChatGPT would avoid sexualized features, and it comes as OpenAI establishes an expert council to advise on AI's impact on user well-being.</p>

          <p>In response to a surge in scams targeting older Americans, with average losses reaching $83,000, AARP has launched a national program called Senior Planet. The initiative offers free fraud-awareness classes to people aged 60 and older, teaching them how to identify red flags and avoid sharing sensitive information with scammers who often impersonate government officials. The Federal Trade Commission reports that scams involving large financial losses have quadrupled recently, making such educational efforts crucial. The program, available both online and in-person, aims to empower seniors with the knowledge to protect themselves from increasingly sophisticated fraud tactics.</p>

          <p>In a joint operation, US and UK authorities have seized over $14 billion in bitcoin and charged Chen Zhi, the founder of Cambodia's Prince Group, with orchestrating a massive cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering scheme. Prosecutors allege Chen masterminded a "sprawling cyber-fraud empire" that used sophisticated online scams to dupe victims into transferring cryptocurrency with false promises of investment returns. The operation also allegedly involved human trafficking, with workers forced to carry out scams from prison-like compounds in Cambodia. The UK government has also frozen significant assets, including 19 properties in London, as part of the international crackdown.</p>

          <p>Striker Haji Wright scored two goals to lead the US men's national team to a 2-1 comeback win against Australia in a friendly match in Colorado. The victory was tempered by an early injury to captain Christian Pulisic, who was forced off the field in the 27th minute after several heavy challenges. Australia took a surprise lead through a goal from Jordy Bos, but Wright equalized before halftime and then scored the winner in the second half. The match was a physical contest that served as preparation for both teams ahead of next year's World Cup tournament.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a dominant complete-game performance, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. After allowing a home run on the first pitch of the game, Yamamoto settled in and threw a three-hitter, making the Dodgers' often-unreliable bullpen a non-factor. The win gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series as it moves to Los Angeles. The article highlights how the Dodgers' superior starting pitching has neutralized the Brewers' advantages, putting them in a strong position to advance to the World Series.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized a Time magazine cover photograph of him, calling it possibly "the Worst of All Time," despite the accompanying article being relatively positive about his role in a Gaza ceasefire. Writing on Truth Social, Trump complained that the photo, taken from a low angle with backlighting, made his hair "disappear" and was "super bad." The image choice has been a topic of discussion, with a Russian official defending Trump and a photo editor suggesting the angle was meant to convey power and grandeur. Trump has a long-documented fascination with appearing on the cover of Time magazine.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion in bitcoin connected to a massive "pig butchering" fraud scheme allegedly run by Chen Zhi from Cambodia. An indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Zhi with wire fraud and money laundering, accusing him of operating one of Asia's largest transnational criminal organizations under the guise of his Prince Holding Group. The scam allegedly lured victims into fraudulent cryptocurrency investments while using trafficked and forced labor in its scam compounds. This action represents the largest forfeiture ever sought by the DOJ in its history.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a series of bills aimed at increasing safety for minors interacting with artificial intelligence and social media. One new law requires AI "companion" chatbots to have guardrails preventing discussions of suicide and to regularly remind minor users they are not human. Other legislation increases penalties for creating nonconsensual AI-generated explicit material and requires social media platforms to display warning labels about potential mental health risks for teens. These laws reflect growing concern over the impact of technology on children's well-being and aim to hold tech companies more accountable for the harm their products may cause.</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol in Merced cited a driver for using a homemade, hand-drawn license plate on their Nissan Sentra. An officer noticed something unusual about the plate and, upon closer inspection, discovered it was a creative but illegal piece of artwork rather than an official state-issued plate. The drawing included the "California" lettering, the DMV website, and a registration sticker. While the CHP post on social media gave the driver "points for creativity," the driver was still issued a $197 fine for the violation of state vehicle law.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new default content restrictions for Instagram users under 18, aligning the platform's content with a PG-13 movie rating standard. The accounts of teens will automatically be placed under a "13+" setting that blocks searches for sensitive terms like "alcohol" and prevents them from following or interacting with accounts that post age-inappropriate content. The new regulations will also apply to Meta's AI features to ensure they do not provide inappropriate responses. Parents will also have the option to choose an even more restrictive "Limited Content" setting for their teens' accounts.</p>
