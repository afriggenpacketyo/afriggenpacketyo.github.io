          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 08:23:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, exceeding $118,000, driven by significant institutional investment into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, with Ether ETFs also seeing massive inflows. The rally was further fueled by a wave of short liquidations and broader market sentiment that the next Federal Reserve leadership will be more dovish. Analysts note that corporate treasury buying and potential crypto legislation are also contributing factors to the positive momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has publicly expressed his support for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), calling any efforts to abolish the agency "inappropriate and outrageous." He stated that ICE agents are performing an important job for the country and should not be treated as criminals. His stance drew praise from several Republican senators, including Ted Cruz and Mike Lee. Fetterman clarified his position by also stating his support for amnesty for hardworking, law-abiding migrant workers while advocating for the deportation of criminals.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, marking a significant milestone for AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment their 12,000 human developers by handling tedious tasks like code updates, with plans to deploy hundreds or even thousands of these AI agents. This move to "agentic AI," which can execute complex, multi-step jobs independently, signals a major shift toward a "hybrid workforce." The bank anticipates this technology could boost worker productivity by three to four times compared to previous AI tools.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the opening of an "Experience Center" showroom in Mumbai on July 15. This move marks the culmination of long-standing plans for the U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer to establish a presence in the country. The company is expected to begin direct sales to customers, importing vehicles from its global manufacturing hubs like Shanghai and Berlin. Tesla will face competition from established players like China's BYD and local manufacturer Tata Motors, as well as navigating India's high import duties on electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>A new autonomous robot designed to improve cotton production is being tested in Xinjiang, China. The robot uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify and remove the top bud of cotton plants with a high-powered laser, a process called "topping" that redirects nutrients to boost boll formation and yield. Developed by a team from Xinjiang University, the machine reportedly achieves 98.9% accuracy in bud detection with minimal plant damage. This technology aims to automate a traditionally inefficient and labor-intensive part of cotton farming, promising a step towards fully automated production.</p>

          <p>IMAX is on track for a record-breaking year at the global box office, with CEO Rich Gelfond forecasting $1.2 billion in revenue, a 33% increase from 2024. The company's success is fueled by a growing consumer demand for premium cinematic experiences and a strong slate of films shot with IMAX cameras, such as "F1: The Movie." These "filmed for IMAX" titles often see a higher market share, with IMAX screens accounting for over 20% of the box office for several major releases despite representing less than 1% of total screens. This trend highlights IMAX's strengthening position in the evolving film industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German tourist, Carolina Wilga, has been found alive and in a "fragile" state after being missing for 12 days in the remote Australian Outback. She was discovered by a member of the public wandering on a forest trail in the Karroun Hill Nature Reserve, a day after her abandoned van was spotted by a police helicopter. Police believe her van became stuck in mud, and she survived in what authorities described as a "very hostile environment." Wilga was flown to a hospital for treatment, with police calling her survival a "remarkable story."</p>

In an interview, Trump stated that NATO would distribute the weapons and reimburse the U.S. for the full cost. This development follows a plea from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for at least 10 Patriot systems to counter a recent surge in Russian drone and missile attacks. The announcement comes after the U.S. had previously paused some critical weapon shipments, raising concerns in Kyiv about their defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Astronomers believe that 3I/Atlas, a newly discovered interstellar object, could be the oldest comet ever observed, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. It is only the third such object detected from beyond our solar system. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk," a region of ancient stars, and is likely composed of water ice. As it approaches the sun later this year, it is expected to develop a glowing tail, potentially becoming visible with amateur telescopes and offering a unique glimpse into a distant part of our galaxy.</p>

          <p>Iconiq Capital, the wealth management firm backed by tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg, is pioneering a new approach to philanthropy through collaborative funds called "co-labs." These initiatives pool capital from multiple high-net-worth families to make large, multiyear grants to nonprofits focused on specific causes, such as youth mental health or climate equity. The model aims to streamline giving for busy clients, move money to charities faster, and foster a peer-learning environment for donors. This approach is seen as increasingly crucial as potential tax changes and federal funding cuts place more pressure on the nonprofit sector. (not investment advice)</p>

During the ceremony, thirty fighters symbolically destroyed their weapons.
