          <h2>Hummingbird Beaks Evolve Due to Backyard Feeders, Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that Anna's Hummingbirds have adapted to backyard feeders, resulting in changes to the size and shape of their beaks. The birds' beaks have become longer and more slender to efficiently extract nectar from feeders, and male beaks have grown pointier for fighting off rivals. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward. Researchers tracked hummingbird feeder mentions in California newspapers and compared it to census data to find the correlation. The study highlights how human actions can rapidly influence the evolution of species. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Japan-based Nippon Steel, aiming to create 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. The Biden administration had previously blocked Nippon Steel's outright acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. While the exact terms of the deal remain unclear, U.S. Steel shares jumped on the news, and the company affirmed its commitment to remaining American. The United Steelworkers union expressed concern that the deal could erode domestic steel-making capacity and jeopardize union jobs.</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp expressed his disappointment after hearing supporters booing Trent Alexander-Arnold. Klopp said that he switched off the television when he heard the booing and highlighted Alexander-Arnold's commitment to the club during Klopp's spell as manager. Alexander-Arnold, who has been with Liverpool since age six, is leaving the club at the end of the season and is expected to join Real Madrid, which may have spurred the negative fan reaction. Klopp defended the Liverpool-born player's contributions and dedication to the team during his tenure.</p>

          <p>The government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating it will be released later this year. The strategy is being developed by the Child Poverty Taskforce, considering measures like scrapping the two-child benefit cap. The delay has drawn criticism from the SNP and Save the Children UK, while the Trussell Trust suggests it may be beneficial if it leads to more substantial measures. The government claims to be committed to reducing child poverty, highlighting existing measures such as expanded free breakfast clubs and increased minimum wage.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors advised him to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH is a rare condition involving excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulation in the brain, more likely to occur in older people. Symptoms include difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems, and the condition is usually treatable with a surgical procedure to drain the fluid. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds.</p>

          <p>President Trump said Friday that U.S. Steel will keep its headquarters in Pittsburgh as part of what he called a "planned partnership" between the iconic American steelmaker and Japan-based Nippon Steel, which has sought to buy it. Nippon Steel's nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped 21% on the news, and continued rising in aftermarket trading. The president also said he'll hold a "BIG Rally" at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh on Friday, May 30.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at accelerating the construction of nuclear power plants, including small, advanced reactors. One order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to streamline rules and approve applications within 18 months. Another directs the Energy and Defense departments to explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases. The Trump administration also set a goal of quadrupling the nation‚Äôs nuclear power capacity by 2050. Critics fear the pressure from the White House could cause the agency to take shortcuts on safety. </p>

McTominay hooked in a fine acrobatic volley - his 12th goal of the season - to give Napoli the lead against Cagliari, before former Manchester United team-mate Romelu Lukaku made the game safe with a second. As soon after the final whistle went, the Scotland midfielder was named Serie A's Most Valuable Player (MVP) for 2024-25.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel canceled upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. It is diagnosed through CT scans or MRIs, followed by a spinal tap to confirm symptom alleviation. Treatment typically involves ventricular shunting to drain the excess fluid. Prognosis depends on early diagnosis and treatment, with gait and bladder issues responding better than cognitive symptoms.</p>

His actions also aim to jump start the mining of uranium in the U.S. and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>
