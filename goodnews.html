This move completes a leadership and ownership transition that began in 2022, with Dalio now set to continue as a significant investor and mentor to the firm. The transition was facilitated by a capital raise from existing investors and employees, allowing the firm to move forward under its new leadership structure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is advancing a pilot program to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. This five-year experiment, set to begin in 2026, aims to address the nation's obesity crisis by making these expensive medications accessible to low-income individuals and retirees. The plan, which follows a similar proposal from the previous administration, would allow state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans to voluntarily cover the drugs for weight management purposes.</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) currently offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that outpace inflation, with top rates available at online banks significantly exceeding national averages. The article notes that due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs of about one year are offering higher yields than longer-term ones. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare rates from online institutions and consider a laddering strategy to balance access to high short-term rates with long-term savings goals.

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low, high-yield savings accounts, particularly those from online banks, offer rates up to 11 times higher. This article emphasizes that these accounts provide a safe, FDIC-insured place for emergency funds while allowing savings to grow significantly faster than in traditional accounts. Consumers are encouraged to compare different online offerings, as many have low or no minimum balance requirements and no monthly fees, making them highly accessible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of late July 2025, the price of gold stood at over $3,300 per ounce, reinforcing its status as an attractive safe-haven asset for investors. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by a variety of factors, including basic supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Because gold often retains its value when fiat currencies weaken, it is frequently used as a hedge against economic turmoil, though its price is subject to constant short-term fluctuation.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Adam Sandler comedy "Happy Gilmore" and its new sequel are more than just frivolous entertainment, suggesting they convey a traditional conservative message about family values. The author contends that the protagonist's motivation in both films is purely altruistic, as he takes up golf not for personal glory but to provide for his grandmother and later his daughter. This focus on familial obligation over self-interest is presented as a core theme of the popular movie franchise.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly had an opening bid for striker Alexander Isak rejected by Newcastle United, as the offer fell short of the club's £150 million valuation. The Swedish international was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour as he reportedly wishes to explore a move, despite his club qualifying for the Champions League. It is uncertain if Liverpool will return with an improved offer, but manager Arne Slot is said to be very keen on adding the 25-year-old striker to his squad.</p>
