Leclerc finished ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli and Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg. Championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren finished fourth, while his main rivals, Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, sat out the session to allow their teams to run junior drivers. The session saw minor incidents, including spins from two rookies, but was largely uneventful as teams fulfilled their mandatory rookie testing requirements on the dusty track.</p>

          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis with a brain aneurysm in a TV show teaser, seemingly attributing it to stress, medical professionals have clarified the relationship. Doctors explain that while stress itself doesn't directly cause an aneurysm, it can elevate blood pressure, which is a significant risk factor for their formation and potential rupture. The primary causes are genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Experts hope her announcement raises awareness about the condition, which affects about 1 in 50 adults, while also cautioning against oversimplifying its causes.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which Zhang had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege Zhang ran a vast drug trafficking and money laundering operation, coordinating the importation of fentanyl from Mexico and working with the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. His extradition marks a significant development in the U.S. crackdown on the international fentanyl supply chain, a key policy focus for the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>In a significant show of support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. This endorsement consolidates establishment Democratic support behind Mamdani, the frontrunner, who is running against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The endorsement follows one for Cuomo from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for the final days of a competitive election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than economists' predictions of 3.1%. While President Trump's tariffs are contributing to upward price pressure, their full impact on consumers has been partly absorbed by businesses. The Department of Labor released the data despite the ongoing government shutdown due to its necessity for calculating Social Security adjustments. With inflation remaining relatively contained and the job market showing signs of slowing, the Federal Reserve is still widely expected to implement another interest rate cut.

          <p>With two months until Christmas, retailers are preparing for a holiday shopping season marked by more cautious consumer behavior by launching sales and marketing campaigns earlier than usual. Executives from companies like Kohl's and Academy Sports and Outdoors note that shoppers, particularly in lower and middle-income brackets, are feeling budget strains and are more price-sensitive. They expect consumers to make more frequent, smaller purchases and to be highly responsive to promotions. Despite concerns over a government shutdown and tariffs, retailers report normal inventory levels and are adapting their discount strategies to attract discerning customers.
