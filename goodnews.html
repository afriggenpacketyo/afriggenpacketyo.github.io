          <p>The article discusses the increasing popularity of food scanner apps that rate the healthfulness of packaged foods. Experts suggest that while these apps can be a useful starting point for consumers aiming to make healthier choices, they should be used with skepticism. Different apps may provide varying scores for the same product due to differing methodologies and data sources. It's recommended to opt for apps that assess overall nutrient content rather than focusing solely on single ingredients, and to approach the results with a balanced perspective, considering the overall nutritional value of foods.</p>

The broadcast aims to rectify the waltz's absence from the Voyager Golden Record in 1977.

The decision aims to avoid confusion related to marriage or divorce involving Japanese and foreigners, acknowledging Taiwan in the registry.</p>
