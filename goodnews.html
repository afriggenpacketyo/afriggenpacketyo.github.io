          <p>A BBC article playfully examines Britain's enduring national pastime of complaining about the weather, inviting readers to compare their local forecasts with cities across the world. This interactive feature allows users to determine if their location genuinely experiences brighter sunshine or if the UK is, in fact, a "green and pleasant land after all," despite public perception. It encourages engagement by suggesting users could become the BBC's next star meteorologist, providing a lighthearted and unique way to connect with meteorological data. The article highlights the cultural significance of weather discourse in Britain.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a significant breakthrough in neuroscience, capturing the intricate “kiss-shrink-run” process of neuronal communication using a pioneering camera with nanometre resolution and millisecond imaging speed. This advanced technology has enabled them to resolve a key scientific debate that has perplexed neuroscientists for half a century regarding the efficient and precise transmission of signals between neurons via synaptic vesicles. The findings, led by biologists from the University of Science and Technology of China and the Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, were published in the academic journal Science, marking a major step in understanding brain function. This discovery opens new avenues for neurological research.</p>

          <p>UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has stated his job is "on the line" to meet Labour's manifesto pledge of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029. Despite Reed's insistence, leading experts from BBC Panorama warn the government is likely to miss this target, citing a cumbersome planning process, environmental regulations, and skill shortages. Reed plans reforms, including mandating council-produced local plans within 30 months and introducing a "grey belt" concept to facilitate development on low-quality green belt land. The government aims to boost funding and training for planning authorities to streamline approvals.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that advising early and frequent introduction of peanut products to infants has prevented approximately 60,000 children from developing peanut allergies. A study published in Pediatrics found a significant decline in peanut allergies among children aged 0-3 after medical guidelines, updated in 2015 and 2017, recommended introducing the allergen as early as four months. This shift in practice, reversing decades of advice to delay, is hailed as a remarkable public health success, despite initial slow adoption. The current guidance encourages introduction between four and six months without prior screening.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered a version of a DNA repair protein, also present in humans, that is linked to the remarkable longevity and disease resistance of naked mole-rats. These burrowing rodents boast an extraordinary lifespan of up to 37 years for their size. Published in Science, the findings suggest that understanding this protein's role could pave the way for new therapeutic anti-ageing strategies aimed at improving human health and lifespan. This research offers a molecular basis for the exceptional longevity observed in naked mole-rats.</p>

          <p>The Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The agency found "items of interest" during a sweep before Trump's arrival, including what appeared to be a hunting stand high in a tree, though it had reportedly been there for months. Officials stated there was no impact on presidential movements and no individuals were present. This discovery follows an attempted assassination plot against the president last year at his nearby golf club, underscoring ongoing security concerns in the area.</p>

          <p>British soldiers will soon receive new powers to shoot down drones posing a threat to military bases, a move aimed at enabling faster, more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce the "kinetic option," allowing troops or Ministry of Defence police to neutralize drones, expanding beyond current protocols of diversion or GPS disruption. This initiative follows mystery drone sightings at four British airbases used by US forces last year and widespread drone disruptions across Europe. While initially for military sites, these powers could potentially extend to civilian locations like airports.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, argues that a multi-sensor system, incorporating LiDAR, is safer and superior for self-driving vehicles compared to Elon Musk's vision-only approach. Qiu contends that vision-only systems cannot account for "corner cases" and are insufficient for Level 3 or 4 automation, citing examples like detecting white cars in bright conditions or black cars in tunnels. Despite Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu notes its cost has significantly decreased while performance has improved. Other auto executives, like Ford's CEO, also deem LiDAR "mission critical." (not investment advice)</p>
