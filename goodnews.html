          <p>Newcastle United has officially signed midfielder Jacob Ramsey from Aston Villa in a deal valued at £40 million. The 24-year-old has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the fourth new player to join the club during the summer transfer window. Ramsey, a former England Under-21 international, had been with Aston Villa since he was six years old, making 167 appearances for the senior team. He expressed excitement about the move, noting that Newcastle's high-energy style of play and passionate fanbase were key factors in his decision to join the club.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both sides. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio emphasized that a lasting deal is the administration's goal, framing the recent summit with Vladimir Putin as a step that made enough progress to justify further talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allies. He indicated that key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, the demarcation of territory, and plans for rebuilding the country. Rubio acknowledged that neither side is on the verge of surrender, making mutual compromise essential for any resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester Originals secured a decisive 57-run victory against the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, largely thanks to an impressive performance by captain Jos Buttler. Buttler scored an unbeaten 64, his second consecutive half-century, providing a strong foundation for his team's total of 171-3. The innings was powerfully concluded by Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 30 runs from the final seven balls. In response, the Superchargers were bowled out for 114, with bowlers Sonny Baker and Josh Tongue each taking three wickets, boosting the Originals' chances in the tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin made a significant concession during his summit with President Trump, agreeing to allow the U.S. and European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. Witkoff described this development as "game-changing," noting it was the first time Russia had consented to such a protective arrangement for Ukraine, which could address a key reason for Kyiv's desire to join NATO. He also stated that Russia agreed to legislate that it would not violate the sovereignty of other European nations. This potential breakthrough came as part of broader discussions aimed at creating a comprehensive peace deal to end the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first of three key inflation data points needed to calculate the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) has been released. The July report for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) showed a 2.5% year-over-year increase. Based on this initial figure, analysts are projecting that the final 2026 COLA will likely be around 2.7%, a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025. The final determination will depend on the inflation data from August and September, with some experts anticipating higher inflation due to delayed tariffs, which could push the final COLA figure higher.

          <p>Dr. Alieu Kamara has become the first and only neurosurgeon in Sierra Leone, a country of eight million people, offering hope to patients who previously had none for conditions like brain tumors and spinal injuries. Before his practice began in January 2025, such cases were often fatal or resulted in severe disability unless the patient was wealthy enough to travel abroad. The article highlights the successful completion of the country's first-ever spine surgery on a paralyzed man, a procedure performed with support from international partners like the nonprofit Mission Brain. Dr. Kamara's work represents a monumental step in building a sustainable neurosurgical program from the ground up in a resource-limited setting.</p>

          <p>Several European and NATO leaders have announced they will join Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for his meeting with President Trump at the White House. This collective move is seen as a show of solidarity and an effort to bolster Zelenskyy's position following his exclusion from the recent Trump-Putin summit in Alaska. Leaders including the European Commission President, the NATO Secretary-General, and the heads of France and Germany will be present in Washington. The united front aims to ensure European interests are represented in any peace negotiations and to prevent a repeat of a contentious previous meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>A port in Shanghai has achieved a maritime industry first by successfully transferring captured carbon dioxide directly from one ship to another. The vessel Ever Top, retrofitted with carbon capture technology, offloaded its stored emissions to a barge, a method described as significantly cheaper and more efficient than previous land-based transfers. This innovation could create a new revenue stream for the shipping industry, as the captured CO2 can be sold for use in various products, from concrete to furniture. The milestone is part of a broader effort to reduce the maritime sector's significant contribution to global air pollution.</p>

          <h2>VAR Disallows Premier League Goal Due to Attacking Player's Proximity to Defensive Wall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 10:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was disallowed by VAR due to a specific and relatively new rule in football. The decision was made because a Crystal Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. This rule, introduced in the 2019-20 season, mandates that when a defending team forms a wall of three or more players, all attacking players must maintain at least a one-meter distance. The law was implemented to prevent management problems and time-wasting caused by attackers interfering with the defensive wall.</p>
