        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams was awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC. The case stemmed from a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article that alleged Adams sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, an allegation Adams vehemently denies. Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable, arguing the corporation upholds a British state ethos out of sync with the Good Friday Agreement. The BBC expressed disappointment, defending its journalistic diligence while acknowledging the implications of the verdict on freedom of expression, with Adams' solicitor calling the allegations untrue and defamatory. The article highlights the legal battle and Adams' broader critique of the BBC's role in Ireland's peace process. </p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are set to appear together as Musk concludes his tenure as a "special government employee." Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will be returning to the private sector but will remain an advisor to the President. During his time in Washington, Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget but only achieved roughly $160 billion in documented savings, with some analysts suggesting DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion. Despite this, Musk participated in Cabinet meetings, traveled on Air Force One, and showcased Tesla vehicles at the White House, demonstrating his close relationship with President Trump. </p>

One image depicts commuters using a nacelle suspended from an aerial ferry bridge to cross the Charente river in Rochefort, France, showcasing a unique mode of transportation with historical significance. The Rochefort's aerial ferry bridge, inaugurated in 1900, allowed people to cross the river without disturbing maritime navigation to and from the city's dockyard. It was used as the main crossing way over the Charente river until 1967, and since 1994 has carried pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

The company's leaders noted that tariffs have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments, occasionally necessitating price increases. Costco's net income rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, while comparable sales increased by 8%, and e-commerce sales rose nearly 16%. While other retailers warn of higher prices due to tariffs, Costco is attempting to mitigate these costs through various strategies, including rushing orders and sourcing private-label items locally.

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs has been hailed as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers. The court found that Trump does not have the "unbounded authority" he claims to impose tariffs without legislative authorization. The decision, prompted by a case filed by the Liberty Justice Center, challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports, arguing that such action exceeds his constitutional authority. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the IEEPA tariffs, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>
