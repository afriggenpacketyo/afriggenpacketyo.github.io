          <p>The European Union and Southeast Asian nations are seeking to enhance the security of undersea cables, which are vital for telecommunications and international trade. Recent incidents in the Baltic and Red Seas have highlighted the vulnerability of these cables to both accidental damage and deliberate sabotage. Concerns also include China's increasing pressure on cable consortia in the South China Sea and the potential for natural disasters to disrupt cable infrastructure. The EU has published an Action Plan on Cable Security and is redirecting funds to boost surveillance and establish emergency repair vessels, with France's Alcatel Submarine Networks playing a key role.</p>

Brentford anticipates a formal approach from Tottenham in the coming days, although there has been no confirmed dialogue between the two clubs yet. Frank's success in guiding Brentford into the Premier League and establishing them as a top-flight club on a small budget makes him a strong candidate. Brentford would be entitled to compensation exceeding ¬£10 million to release Frank from his contract, which runs until 2027.</p>

          <p>Following a series of high-profile kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives, the "Bitcoin Family" has overhauled its security measures to protect their crypto assets. Didi Taihuttu, the family's patriarch, explained that they have moved away from hardware wallets in favor of a hybrid system that combines analog and digital methods. This involves encrypting and splitting seed phrases, storing them through blockchain-based encryption services, and hiding them across four continents. The family's lifestyle, which involves living entirely on bitcoin and traveling full-time, makes them particularly vulnerable to such threats, prompting them to prioritize safety and decentralization in their financial security.</p>
