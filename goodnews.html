          <p>The Australian state of Victoria is implementing machete disposal bins at police stations to encourage citizens to surrender the weapons before a statewide ban takes effect on September 1. The government has established an amnesty period until November 30, after which possession of a machete without a valid exemption could result in imprisonment or a significant fine. Officials state the measure is a response to rising knife crime, with police seizing a record number of illegal knives. Exemptions exist for agricultural workers and for traditional or cultural use under strict conditions.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully developed and deployed a specialized cryogenic steel, named CHSN01, crucial for constructing nuclear fusion reactors. The material addresses a long-standing global challenge of finding a substance that can withstand both extreme cold, near absolute zero, and the immense magnetic forces within a fusion device. This breakthrough was essential for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) project after previous materials proved too brittle. The development of this super steel, a decade-long effort, places China in a leading position in a critical area of materials science for future energy.</p>

          <p>Dylan Field, the 33-year-old CEO of design software company Figma, has become a tech billionaire following his company's successful IPO, which saw its valuation soar to over $71 billion. Field, a Brown University dropout, was a 2012 Thiel Fellow, receiving $100,000 to build his company instead of finishing his degree. After a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles, Figma went public independently, marking a major event for a slow tech IPO market. Colleagues describe Field as exceptionally humble, contrasting his leadership style with other hard-charging tech founders.</p>

The initiative aims to combat misleading marketing hype and reduce confusion for investors by providing clear definitions for ambiguous phrases like "multifamily office" and "assets under advisement." As competition for wealthy clients intensifies, the group hopes this resource will help investors navigate an industry filled with inflated language.

          <p>This article presents the poem "Faith" by Kevin Young, which is featured in the September 2025 print edition of The Atlantic. The poem uses the metaphor of small birds in a road to contemplate survival and resilience in the face of danger. The speaker observes how the birds feast on unseen things and instinctively fly away from approaching wheels, a simple act of existence that is likened to a form of faith. The poem concludes with the image of the birds flying away to sing, suggesting a sense of enduring life and expression.</p>

          <p>Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim has revealed the deep frustration he felt during the team's difficult previous season, admitting he often went to games fearing his team would not be competitive. Amorim, who took over in November 2024, presided over the club's worst season since 1973-74, finishing 15th in the Premier League. He states that he is now implementing a new culture with stricter rules and a leadership group of senior players to uphold standards. Despite the past struggles, Amorim expressed his belief that the club will win major trophies again and that he hopes to remain manager for 20 years.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Zhejiang University have developed the "Darwin Monkey," the world's first brain-like computer built with over 2 billion artificial neurons. The system is comprised of 960 specialized Darwin 3 neuromorphic chips, which create a network of over 100 billion synapses, mimicking the structure of a biological brain. This groundbreaking computer has already been used to perform complex tasks such as content generation, logical reasoning, and mathematics. The university states this achievement is a significant step toward developing more advanced, brain-like artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, known for his dominant but often stoic on-course demeanor, may benefit from a surprising new role in the movie "Happy Gilmore 2." The article argues that while Scheffler's consistent victories can lack drama, his comedic, self-effacing performance in the film could enhance his public image. In the movie, Scheffler plays along with a narrative that pokes fun at his real-life arrest earlier this year, showing a fun-loving side that could make him more relatable to fans. This newfound persona could help make his continued success on the PGA tour more engaging for viewers.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the United States and other major Western powers cut their foreign aid budgets, a few countries, including Spain, Ireland, South Korea, and Italy, are bucking the trend by increasing their spending. Spain has committed to more than doubling its aid budget by 2030, a move driven by long-standing public support for global development. The article notes that while these increases are not enough to fill the gap left by the U.S., they signal a potential shift toward a more collaborative and less paternalistic model of aid. This change comes as the world faces a projected $56 billion funding vacuum for global health and food assistance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian scientists suggests that earthquakes play a crucial role in sustaining life in Earth's deep biosphere, which is estimated to hold up to one-fifth of the planet's total biomass. Researchers found that seismic activity can generate hydrogen gas, a vital energy source for deep-dwelling microbes that live without sunlight. This process provides a mechanism for how these prokaryotes can survive in the most isolated and extreme environments beneath the Earth's surface. The discovery offers a new understanding of the hidden ecosystems that thrive in the planet's darkest depths.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Peter Guralnick's new book, "The Colonel and the King," provides a deeply researched biography of Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's controversial long-time manager. The book focuses heavily on Parker's life, from his origins as an immigrant from Holland to his time as a carny and his rise in the music business. Guralnick, who knew Parker personally, attempts to provide a more nuanced view of the manager, challenging perceptions that he was simply a con man who exploited Presley. While comprehensive, the review notes the book can read like an apologia, though it offers a fascinating look at a life defined by self-mythology.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay examines the crucial, yet often overlooked, period in 1775 when George Washington took command of the Continental Army outside Boston. The author highlights how Washington, a Virginia slaveholder, forged a unified American army from disparate and undisciplined New England militias. Through quiet, pragmatic leadership—organizing the army, enforcing discipline, and promoting talented men like Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene regardless of their background—he laid the foundation for victory. The article argues that this unspectacular work of building a cohesive force was as vital as any battle, showcasing the character and judgment that defined his greatness.</p>

          <p>Dozens of dogs took to the waves in Pacifica, California, for the annual World Dog Surfing Championships, drawing thousands of spectators to the beach. Canine competitors, from labs to French bulldogs, were judged on their balance, ride duration, and any tricks performed on their boards. The event featured heats for different sized dogs, as well as tandem rides with other dogs or their human owners. Owners described the sport as a unique way to bond with their pets, creating a sense of teamwork and shared accomplishment beyond a typical walk in the park.</p>

          <p>This article provides individual player ratings for the British and Irish Lions following their 2-1 series win against the Wallabies in Australia. While the Lions secured the series victory, the analysis suggests it was a hard-fought contest where the Wallabies won four of the six halves of rugby played. Standout players like Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry received high marks for their immense work rate and impact throughout the tour. The piece concludes that while the 2025 squad was a good team with great players, they were not a historically great team, having been pushed close by an undercooked Australian side.</p>
