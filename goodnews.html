          <p>American Express and JPMorgan Chase are set to refresh their premium credit card offerings, the Platinum and Sapphire Reserve respectively, intensifying competition in the luxury credit card market. American Express plans to launch major changes to its consumer and business Platinum cards later this year, promising significant new benefits. JPMorgan Chase is also expected to update its Sapphire Reserve card with enhanced travel, dining, and experience perks, potentially increasing its annual fee. Both companies aim to provide cardholders with value that far exceeds the annual fee, with the Platinum card currently at $695 and the Sapphire at $550. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares rose after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent on signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions such as relocating headquarters, moving production or jobs outside the U.S., renaming the company, and closing plants before specific time frames. The deal is structured as a partnership, with U.S. Steel becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, and all regulatory approvals have been secured. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida biologists have removed 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, marking a significant milestone in the state's efforts to curb the python population. The conservancy has also shattered their previous record for a single-season haul. The removal efforts, which focus on tracking and capturing breeding females, have prevented an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013. Experts acknowledge that complete eradication is unlikely but emphasize the positive impact of each python removed, leading to some demographic shifts and a decrease in larger-sized pythons in certain areas.</p>

          <p>WhatsApp is set to launch three new ad features globally across its messaging app, with the new ads appearing in a separate section called Updates. The Meta-owned platform says the new ads will not be shown in the same place as people's private chats, nor will the contents of their messages be used to decide which ads to display. WhatsApp will instead use the country, city and language of the user, as well as how they interact with other ads and which channels they follow, to drive suggested content. Businesses with channels will be able to choose to promote ads in the Updates section to attract new followers, and also charge a subscription to access extra content.</p>

          <p>Meta is introducing advertisements to WhatsApp, allowing businesses to run status ads within the app's Updates tab. The move marks a significant shift for the messaging app, which has historically avoided advertising. Meta will also monetize WhatsApp's Channels feature through search ads and subscriptions. The company aims to limit disruption to users by keeping ads separate from personal conversations and ensuring encryption remains in place for status updates, personal messages, and calls. Meta hopes to make WhatsApp a key part of its business strategy, with over 3 billion monthly users worldwide.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City has transformed Manhattan streets by reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit, but the program faces opposition from the Trump administration. The program, which charges drivers entering lower Manhattan, has resulted in fewer vehicles on the road and faster bus routes. Despite its early success, the federal government is attempting to revoke the approval granted in 2023, potentially leaving a $15 billion hole in the MTA‚Äôs capital budget. The policy is also facing lawsuits from outside the city and in New Jersey.</p>

By the weekend some places could easily beat the highest temperature recorded so far this year - 29.4C (85F) in Suffolk on 13 June. For a heatwave to be declared by the Met Office we need to reach a threshold temperature for at least three consecutive days, and that varies from 25C across the north and west of the UK, to 28C in parts of eastern England.</p>
