        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Purdue University is preparing an expedition to a remote Pacific island to investigate a "visual anomaly" they believe could be Amelia Earhart's lost aircraft. The object, identified in satellite imagery of a lagoon on Nikumaroro, has been visible in photos since 1938, a year after her disappearance. The team plans to use sonar and magnetometers before attempting to dredge the object, which they hope will provide "smoking-gun proof" for the theory that Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan landed on the island. This development comes as President Trump ordered the declassification of government records related to the famous aviator.</p>

          <p>Miami Hurricanes quarterback Carson Beck has publicly addressed his breakup with social media influencer and former basketball player Hanna Cavinder. Speaking ahead of a major game, Beck described the difficulty of navigating a personal matter under intense media scrutiny, stating that only half of what is reported is true. Cavinder had previously discussed the split, citing Beck's behavior as the reason for the separation. Beck noted that the experience has been a period of personal growth and soul-searching, helping him refocus on his football career and personal goals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a deep dive into the legacy of Amelia Earhart, arguing that the persistent conspiracy theories surrounding her 1937 disappearance obscure the more mundane, tragic reality of her fate. Aviation historians largely agree that she and navigator Fred Noonan ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific, a conclusion supported by her own family's records. The author contends that the myths of her being a spy or a castaway were fueled by public appetite for a more dramatic story and were even promoted for profit by her own widower. The piece calls for remembering Earhart for her actual achievements rather than the fictions surrounding her death.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has agreed to purchase OxyChem, the petrochemical division of Occidental Petroleum, for $9.7 billion in cash. This marks Berkshire's largest acquisition since 2022 and comes as the conglomerate holds a near-record cash reserve of $344 billion. Occidental plans to use $6.5 billion of the proceeds to reduce its debt, a move its CEO says will unlock the company's stock value and allow for the resumption of a share buyback program. The deal deepens the existing relationship between the two companies, as Berkshire already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Investment Analysis Explains Why High-Priced Stocks Can Still Offer Significant Growth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 10:46:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the common misconception, known as "low-price bias," that stocks with lower share prices have greater potential for growth than more expensive ones. It argues that a stock's nominal price is not an indicator of its value or future returns, which are instead driven by underlying company fundamentals like revenue and earnings growth. Using the example of Nvidia versus International Paper, the analysis demonstrates how a high-priced stock with strong fundamentals can vastly outperform a low-priced one. Investors are advised to focus on valuation and growth prospects rather than being misled by the share price alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Re-evaluating S&P 500-Focused Investment Strategies Amid Market Highs</h2>

          <p>As the S&P 500 reaches new all-time highs, some financial experts are cautioning against the popular "set-it-and-forget-it" investment strategy focused on the index. They argue that the S&P 500 has become less diversified, with a heavy concentration in a few large-cap technology companies, which increases volatility risk. The index has also experienced long periods of underperformance in the past. To mitigate risk, advisors suggest diversifying into total market index funds, which include small- and mid-cap stocks, or adding exposure to international markets, value stocks, and bonds.

          <p>October 3 marks German Unity Day, commemorating the formal reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. The date was chosen over November 9, the day the Berlin Wall fell, to avoid coinciding with the anniversary of the 1938 Nazi pogroms. Unlike more boisterous national holidays, celebrations are typically subdued, with an official festival hosted by a different federal state each year. Despite over three decades of political unity, recent polls indicate that a majority of Germans, particularly in the east, feel the country has not yet fully grown together, citing persistent economic disparities.</p>

          <p>EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic has stated that a key agreement to ease trade friction for agricultural products between the UK and the European Union could be implemented within a year if there is sufficient political will. The deal, struck in May, aims to reduce paperwork and routine border checks while maintaining high food standards. A representative from retailer Marks & Spencer highlighted the urgency of the deal, citing the ongoing complexity and cost of importing food into Ireland from Britain, which has hampered investment. The negotiations are reportedly well-advanced, signaling a potential positive step in post-Brexit trade relations.</p>

          <p>Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev believes the tokenization of real-world assets like stocks, bonds, and real estate is an unstoppable "freight train" that will eventually encompass the entire financial system. Tokenization involves creating a digital representation of an asset on a blockchain, which can enhance market efficiency and accessibility. Tenev predicts that most major markets will establish a regulatory framework for tokenized assets within five years, with the practice becoming the default method for international investors to gain exposure to U.S. stocks. This trend signals a significant convergence of traditional finance and cryptocurrency technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following her death at age 91, primatologist Jane Goodall is being remembered not only for her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees but also for her radical and unwavering advocacy for animal rights. Goodall translated her scientific findings on animal intelligence and interiority into a moral imperative, vocally opposing factory farming and invasive animal experimentation. This stance often placed her at odds with the mainstream scientific community, yet she used her global stature to campaign for an end to biomedical testing on primates and to support legal personhood for animals. Her legacy is one of both scientific discovery and profound ethical conviction.</p>

          <p>Tesla announced a 7% year-over-year increase in vehicle deliveries for the third quarter of 2025, reporting 497,099 units delivered. This growth was partially attributed to a rush of U.S. buyers aiming to secure a federal EV tax credit that expired at the end of the quarter. The positive U.S. performance helped offset a sales slump in Europe, where the company faces increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk. Despite the rise in deliveries, vehicle production saw a slight decline compared to the same period last year. (not investment advice)</p>

During recent trade talks in Washington, her negotiating team focused on securing a strategic partnership that allows Taiwan's vital tech industry to remain based at home while also supporting its expansion abroad. Instead of conceding production capacity, Taiwan is seeking agreements on supply-chain cooperation and preferential tariff treatment. The "Taiwan model" being proposed also involves helping to foster industry clusters in the U.S., backed by Taiwanese expertise and government support.</p>
