          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely advanced on Monday, mirroring Wall Street's previous gains, as investors reacted to China's central bank maintaining its loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision, which held the one-year LPR at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, was in line with economists' expectations despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Major indices across the region, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi, saw increases, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight decline. The stability in China's rates, amidst global monetary policy shifts, continues to influence regional economic sentiment and investment trends, reflecting a cautious yet steady approach to monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, delivered a powerful and emotional speech at her husband's memorial service, publicly stating her forgiveness for Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of his murder. Speaking to a vast audience in Arizona, she emphasized that love, not hate, is the ultimate answer, reflecting deeply held Christian values and what she believed would be her husband's sentiment. Kirk tearfully recounted the harrowing moment she saw her husband's body, noting a "faintest smile" that suggested he did not suffer. Her message starkly contrasted with more aggressive rhetoric from other speakers, highlighting a call for spiritual revival and continued advocacy for the American family.</p>

          <p>Individuals facing terminal illnesses are discovering profound solace and connection through the creation of personalized music playlists, underscoring music's significant therapeutic benefits in palliative and end-of-life care. The article features Dave Gilmore, a former DJ who is meticulously curating his own life's soundtrack, and Anna-Kay Brocklesby, who continues to find deep comfort in her late husband's favorite songs. Experts explain that music "lights up" multiple regions of the brain simultaneously, effectively reducing anxiety and psychological pain, and can even reach individuals who are unconscious. This practice helps both patients and their loved ones create shared experiences and maintain a vital sense of connection during immensely difficult times.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, joining over 140 other nations in a coordinated diplomatic move despite strong opposition from the United States and Israel. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the recognition aims to "revive hope of peace" and is explicitly not a reward for Hamas, emphasizing that the group can have no future role in government or security. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described it as a "coordinated international effort" to build momentum for a two-state solution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vehemently condemned the recognition as a "huge reward to terror," vowing that no Palestinian state would be established west of the Jordan River.</p>

          <p>Research based on over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine crucial practices that significantly foster exceptional social skills in children, strongly emphasizing the importance of emotional safety and authentic connection within the home environment. These practices include openly discussing feelings, consistently modeling empathy in daily interactions, fostering genuine confidence through supportive challenges, and proactively teaching effective conflict resolution strategies. Parents are also encouraged to validate children's emotions, gently help them recognize subtle social cues, and allow sufficient space for independent problem-solving. Treating mistakes as valuable learning opportunities and actively listening more than lecturing further build resilience and compassion, ensuring children develop into empathetic individuals prepared for real-world relationships.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK Work and Pensions Secretary, has emphatically declared that comprehensive welfare system reform "must happen" to provide better support for individuals and address the escalating costs of benefits. Following the government's recent reversal on previously proposed disability benefit cuts, new plans are being introduced to offer targeted skills and employment support to those on sickness benefits who currently have no requirement to seek employment. McFadden indicated that tightening eligibility for Universal Credit or removing entitlement for individuals under 22 remains a possibility. The initiative aims to transition people from long-term benefits back into the workforce, recognizing the current system as both "unhealthy" and fiscally unsustainable.</p>

Founded by prominent figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, UATX seeks to directly counter what it perceives as stifled free expression and pervasive political imbalance on other university campuses. The institution prioritizes intellectual merit and capacity for deep thought over identity in its admissions process and utilizes the Chatham House Rule to encourage candid classroom discussions. With a lean campus model and robust donor backing, UATX positions itself as a new paradigm for cultivating critical thinking and diverse viewpoints.</p>

          <p>Tens of millions of monarch butterflies from a unique "super generation" undertake an epic 3,000-mile migration from Canada and the northern U.S. to Mexico, remarkably living up to nine times longer than typical monarchs. This extraordinary journey, driven by a suppressed reproductive hormone that aids energy conservation, allows them to overwinter in specific Mexican mountain forests. Despite a significant 70% population decline over the past three decades, dedicated conservation efforts by organizations like the World Wildlife Fund and Monarch Watch are showing positive results. These initiatives include combating illegal logging, planting crucial milkweed, and fostering community engagement to protect the monarchs' critical habitats and intricate migration routes.</p>

This expansion could potentially increase annual flights to approximately 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the airport anticipates welcoming up to 80 million passengers and creating numerous local jobs, the decision faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who are deeply concerned about the environmental impact, increased noise pollution, and rising climate emissions. The government, however, emphasizes strict adherence to legally binding climate change commitments.</p>
