        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has announced new, more stringent guidelines for approving future Covid-19 vaccine boosters for healthy individuals, requiring pharmaceutical companies to conduct clinical trials demonstrating safety and effectiveness before approval. This shift comes as Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is overhauling the nation's health agencies and immunization policies. While immunogenicity data will suffice for high-risk groups, healthy individuals will require randomized, controlled trials showing actual clinical outcomes, such as reduced infections or hospitalizations. The FDA believes the previous one-size-fits-all approach is outdated, and the new guidelines aim to balance regulatory flexibility with rigorous scientific standards.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly committed to remaining at the helm of the electric vehicle company for the next five years, aiming to maintain control and prevent potential ousting by activist investors. Musk emphasized that his continued leadership is not about monetary gain but about ensuring reasonable control over Tesla's future direction. This announcement follows investor concerns about his dedication to Tesla amidst his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency. Despite a recent drop in automotive revenue and net income, Musk's reaffirmation has seemingly boosted investor confidence, with Tesla shares showing a slight increase.</p>

          <p>Following the tragic deaths of John Heathco and his girlfriend from carbon monoxide poisoning in a Mexico hotel room, his family is launching the John Wesley Heathco Legacy Foundation to legally require hotels to have working carbon monoxide detectors in each room. Currently, only 14 states mandate this safety measure. The family hopes to empower travelers with safety information and prevent similar tragedies. Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig and Rep. Mike Levin of California plan to introduce new legislation to require carbon monoxide detectors in hotels and other short-term rentals nationwide, as unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires kills about 400 Americans each year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering accepting a free luxury Boeing 747-8 from Qatar to serve as a temporary Air Force One, due to delays in the production of the new Air Force One jets. The proposed arrangement has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, who raise ethical concerns and question the financial practicality given the costs of refitting and operating the plane. The decision-making process involved weeks of secret coordination between Washington and Doha, with President Trump's Middle East envoy, Steven Witkoff, playing a key role. The plane, previously owned by the Qatari royal family, has opulent features that align with Trump's preferences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study casts doubt on the long-held belief that dark streaks on Mars are evidence of flowing water, suggesting instead that they are likely caused by dry processes like wind and dust deposition. Researchers used machine learning to analyze over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images, creating a global Martian map of slope streaks. The analysis revealed that the streaks were more often associated with above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, rather than factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin. This finding challenges the notion that these areas could be habitable regions.</p>

Another video showing aid being airdropped into Gaza dates back to March 2024 and does not involve China.

This action comes amid growing protests against over-tourism, particularly in the Canary Islands, where thousands have demonstrated against the negative impacts of mass tourism. The government asserts that the rental properties in question have violated norms regarding housing for tourist use, including failing to provide a license number or specifying the legal status of the owner. The clampdown aims to prioritize housing for local residents and prevent the uncontrolled expansion of tourism-related properties.</p>
