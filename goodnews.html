          <p>Apple and miner MP Materials have established a significant partnership to strengthen the U.S. supply chain for rare earth elements. The $500 million deal involves Apple purchasing magnets from a new Texas facility and collaborating on a recycling line in California. This strategic move is part of a broader U.S. effort to reduce reliance on China for these critical components, which are essential for manufacturing consumer electronics, vehicles, and renewable energy systems. The investment is expected to create new manufacturing and research roles in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have detected the largest merger of two black holes ever observed, an event which created a new, single black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery was made by the international LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, which uses gravitational waves to identify cosmic events. The two merging black holes were themselves unusually large and spinning rapidly, challenging current scientific models of how such objects are formed. This finding, dubbed GW231123, is expected to open new doors for astronomical research.</p>
