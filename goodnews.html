          <p>SK Hynix shares have reached a two-decade high following reports that SK Group is planning to build South Korea's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM), has benefited from the AI boom, with its shares surging almost 50% this year. The company's success in high bandwidth memory (HBM), used in artificial intelligence servers, has allowed it to overtake Samsung in the overall DRAM market, capturing 70% of the HBM market revenue share in the first quarter.

          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting its focus to the global arms export market to deepen ties with allies and enhance the interoperability of its forces. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has signaled a sharper focus on the defense sector, driven more by security concerns than profit motives, and this shift aims to develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons imports. By exporting arms, Japan can standardize maintenance processes and create joint training opportunities, while also achieving economies of scale in domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

Boca Juniors initially took a 2-0 lead in the first half, but Benfica fought back to secure a point, with the event blending authentic football energy with the commercialized nature of the FIFA Club World Cup, as FIFA seeks to incorporate the passion and culture of clubs like Boca Juniors into its global event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is warning that patients filming their medical treatment for TikTok or Instagram could pose risks to themselves and NHS staff. The trade union's annual conference heard that more patients were videoing their procedures on mobile phones, often without asking permission, which could distract staff or make them feel uncomfortable. Sharing material on social media also risks publicizing the private medical data of other people who may be in the same room or area of the hospital, and NHS staff are calling for clear policies on filming in hospitals.</p>

To date, Operation UNITED has resulted in 33 positive identifications, providing answers to families who had long searched for their missing relatives, and the project has inspired other cities to launch similar initiatives.</p>

Stylists like Chang Youli, who runs a make-up studio, have noticed increased competition as more people join the trade to cater to tourists seeking hanfu photoshoots. This cottage industry employs costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers, packaging services for an all-in-one experience, and last year, Xian saw 306 million trips, generating tourism income of 376 billion yuan.</p>

The order will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed on all car imports earlier this year, and the UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed".

Arias' work was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to strengthen ties with Latin American countries, and her legacy was largely unknown until her grandson discovered her sheet music in 2006.</p>
