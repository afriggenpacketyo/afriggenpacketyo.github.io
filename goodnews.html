        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel engaged in a tense exchange with a reporter regarding the uncertain status of star receiver Stefon Diggs for the upcoming season opener. Vrabel questioned the reporter's motives, suggesting the inquiry was an attempt to bait him into a specific response. Diggs, who is recovering from an ACL tear sustained last season, has been medically cleared but did not play in preseason games, leading to speculation about his availability. The coach maintained that the team is adopting a wait-and-see approach, while Diggs himself has been noncommittal about his return for Week 1.</p>

          <p>Students in the UK who started secondary school during the COVID-19 pandemic have opened time-capsule letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds in 2021. The letters reveal their anxieties about the virus and their hopes for the future, written just after returning from a lengthy lockdown. Reading their past thoughts on friendships, future success, and even romance, the now 16-year-old students reflected on their unique and challenging educational journey. The exercise provided a poignant look at their resilience and personal growth ahead of receiving their GCSE exam results.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Guatemala successfully freed nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riot was part of a larger protest by members of the country's two largest gangs, who were demanding the return of 10 leaders that had been transferred to a different facility. The incident is the latest event in the ongoing violent rivalry between the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs for territorial control. This hostage situation followed a separate incident where 11 other guards were also taken and subsequently freed.</p>

This culinary wave aims to challenge outdated stereotypes and showcase the sophistication of Chinese gastronomy, with some restaurants creating immersive cultural experiences. The trend reflects a broader rise in China's soft power, using food as a form of cultural diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled 'Sunset Boulevard' examines the final creative period of Elvis Presley's life, compiling music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This era included his last Top 10 hit, 'Burning Love,' and sessions that occurred shortly before he was considered for a role in the film 'A Star Is Born.' Friends of the late singer believe that losing the movie role contributed to a decline in his career before his death in 1977. The collection offers a look at Presley as a mature and expressive ballad singer, showcasing his work after his famous '68 comeback special.</p>

          <p>Sunderland marked their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, ending a long-standing drought of wins in the opening months of a top-flight season.

The impressive performance, fueled by both new signings and established players, suggests a promising start for the newly promoted team.

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market has increased, narrowing the gap with Apple, largely driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones. In the second quarter, Samsung's market share rose to 31% from 23%, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. The new form factors, like the Z Fold 7, are gaining traction and allowing Samsung to compete at higher price points. Analysts suggest Apple may respond by releasing its own foldable iPhone in the coming years to reclaim its innovative edge and address the new competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Zealand citizen and her 6-year-old son have been released after being held in a U.S. immigration detention center in Texas for over three weeks. The mother, Sarah Shaw, was detained while re-entering the U.S. from Canada due to an expired travel permit, a mistake her lawyer described as a minor administrative error. Despite her son's documents being valid, both were transported thousands of miles from their Washington state home. Her attorney argued that border officials had the discretion to grant her humanitarian parole instead of detaining her, calling the action inappropriate and inhumane.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the government expedite a plan to bring sick and injured children from Gaza to the UK for medical treatment. In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the 'decimated' healthcare system in Gaza and urged that any bureaucratic barriers to evacuation be removed. The letter calls for evacuations to be based solely on clinical need and for families to have the option of seeking asylum in the UK. The move follows a government promise to establish such a scheme, which is expected to help a few hundred children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are encouraging adults over the age of 60 to eat more salmon to support their heart health. The fish is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower 'bad' LDL cholesterol, raise 'good' HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. Maintaining muscle mass, including the heart muscle itself, is crucial for cardiovascular health as people age, and protein plays a key role in this process. Experts recommend consuming two servings of omega-3-rich fish like salmon per week, prepared through healthy methods such as baking or grilling rather than frying.</p>
