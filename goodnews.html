          <p>UCLA's baseball team has an advantage at the Men's College World Series due to their prior experience playing at Charles Schwab Field during the Big Ten tournament. Despite a loss to Nebraska in the conference title game, the Bruins gained familiarity with the ballpark and the Omaha environment. Coach John Savage emphasizes the importance of using that experience to their advantage while maintaining their competitive edge. UCLA's talented team, led by star shortstop Roch Cholowsky and outfielder Dean West, aims to showcase West Coast baseball on a national stage.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress of lawmaker involvement in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance, addressing concerns about the pact's future. This assurance came after reports suggested the Pentagon was reviewing the security agreement between Australia, Britain, and the US. The Aukus alliance, launched in 2021, is widely seen as a countermeasure to China's growing regional influence. Chinese officials have voiced opposition to the alliance, viewing it as a bloc confrontation that amplifies the risk of nuclear proliferation.</p>
