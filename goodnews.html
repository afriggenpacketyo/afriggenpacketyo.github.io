          <p>A large fire broke out at a Chevron oil refinery in El Segundo, California, one of the largest on the U.S. West Coast, following reports of an explosion. Chevron's on-site fire department, along with local emergency services, responded to the incident and successfully contained the blaze. The company confirmed that all personnel and contractors were accounted for and that no injuries occurred as a result of the fire. Officials did not issue evacuation orders for the surrounding area, as monitoring systems detected no dangerous emissions beyond the facility's fenceline.</p>

          <p>China and India are set to resume direct flights, marking a significant step toward normalizing relations after a five-year suspension that began during the COVID-19 pandemic and continued amid border tensions. India's largest airline, IndiGo, announced it will restart services between Kolkata and Guangzhou on October 26, with plans for a New Delhi route soon. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated that the resumption of flights is contingent on carrier approvals and is expected to enhance people-to-people exchanges.

          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England national team for the upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. Saka's return is a key change to the squad, which notably omits star players Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish. The 24-year-old recently made his comeback for Arsenal, scoring in a win against Olympiacos. His inclusion comes as England prepares for a friendly and a crucial World Cup qualifier, where a victory in Latvia would move them closer to securing a spot in the 2026 tournament.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a Republican member of a recent House delegation to China outlines five strategies to prevent a new Cold War from escalating into armed conflict. The proposals include increasing high-level dialogue to avoid miscalculation, recognizing China's internal brittleness despite its external strength, and fortifying regional alliances with partners like Japan and India. The article also advocates for pursuing mutual interests, such as combating fentanyl production, while renewing American strength at home through economic and regulatory reforms. The author argues that thorough preparation and clear-eyed diplomacy are essential for deterring aggression.</p>

          <p>United States Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino has defended his practice of not explaining to players why they were left off the roster. He argues that players should intuitively understand their performance and that providing justifications is unnecessary. This philosophy was highlighted as he announced the 26-man squad for upcoming friendlies, which saw the return of several players like Weston McKennie but excluded others such as Yunus Musah. Pochettino emphasized his goal of changing the team's culture to one where a spot on the World Cup roster is earned through consistent performance, not past reputation.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on the evolution of passenger rail, contrasting its humble beginnings 200 years ago with China's modern high-speed railway system. The author argues that China's extensive and efficient network should serve as an inspiration for the rest of the world, transforming long-distance travel and revitalizing a mode of transport once seen as outdated. The piece recounts the author's personal experience of a 15-hour train journey from Beijing to Xian in the 1980s, which now takes only four hours. This transformation showcases the potential for infrastructure investment to drive progress.</p>

The new Grand Duke, who was educated in Switzerland and the UK, is not expected to make significant changes to the largely ceremonial role.

          <p>As the annual Nobel Prize announcements approach, this article examines their continued relevance and critiques their historical biases. While the prizes successfully popularize major scientific achievements, such as mRNA vaccines and gene-editing, they are criticized for promoting a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The analysis also highlights a significant lack of diversity, with laureates overwhelmingly being male and from Western institutions in the US and Europe. Critics argue that this bias can exacerbate funding inequalities and fails to recognize groundbreaking work from other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>Thirty-five years after German reunification, significant social and economic gaps persist between the former East and West, according to a new government report. While younger generations have grown up in a unified country, those in the East still face lower incomes, less inherited wealth, and more limited public infrastructure in rural areas. The federal commissioner for eastern Germany, Elisabeth Kaiser, highlights that these disadvantages shape lives and contribute to a distinct "East German" identity that is less common in the West. Despite economic growth, demographic challenges like an aging population threaten to widen the divide.</p>
