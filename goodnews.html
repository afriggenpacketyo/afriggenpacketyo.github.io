        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expression 'Das crazy,' a hybrid of German and English, has been voted the German Youth Word of the Year for 2025, reflecting the influence of internet and meme culture on language. The term is praised for its versatility, used to express surprise or speechlessness, and its deliberate grammatical incorrectness highlights a playful break from linguistic rules. Chosen through an online vote by publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the selection underscores the trend towards brevity and the dominance of English in youth slang. It narrowly beat 'goonen,' a term for excessive self-gratification.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a stake in Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) and is engaging with its management, signaling potential strategic changes. The move follows shareholder discontent over KDP's planned all-cash merger with coffee company JDE Peet's, a deal that heavily favors majority owner JAB Holdings and has caused KDP's stock to fall significantly. Starboard, known for its operational expertise, may seek to influence the company's direction, restore investor confidence, and unlock value, similar to its successful engagement with Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers during a similarly unpopular merger. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A grassroots movement in Missouri, called People Not Politicians, is actively collecting signatures to place a referendum on the 2026 ballot, aiming to overturn a newly enacted gerrymandered congressional map. The Republican-drawn map, signed into law last month, is designed to eliminate one of the state's Democratic districts in Kansas City. Despite facing legal challenges from the state's attorney general, volunteers have gathered over 100,000 signatures, fueled by voter resentment over political maneuvers that dilute their voting power. The effort reflects a broader national battle over redistricting ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Recommends Key Steps for Parents Before Introducing Children to Smartphones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 09:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge advises parents to delay giving children smartphones until they can drive and to restrict social media access until age 16 to promote better mental health outcomes. To prepare for this, she recommends starting conversations about responsible technology use at least six years in advance, ideally in late elementary school. Key preparatory steps include teaching children about online privacy, the value of their time away from screens, and establishing firm rules like no phones in bedrooms overnight. Twenge stresses that it is never too late for parents to set new boundaries, even with teens who already have devices.</p>

          <p>Michael Berkowitz, a former commodities trader, successfully launched Norwegian Wool, a luxury coat brand known for combining Italian style with winter-proof warmth. He founded the company from his Bronx apartment in 2014 with a $50,000 personal investment, initially testing prototypes in a supermarket's walk-in freezer. Today, the brand is profitable and its coats, which retail for over $1,500, are sold in more than 100 stores worldwide and have been worn by financiers, politicians, and even featured in the HBO show "Succession." Berkowitz's success stems from identifying a market gap for stylish, high-performance outerwear suitable for cold urban environments.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett articulated his long-held skepticism of gold as an investment, categorizing it as an asset that produces nothing and relies solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future. He contrasted this with his preferred investment category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate tangible value and returns over time. Buffett illustrated his point by explaining that all the world's gold would fit into a 68-foot cube that just sits there, unlike a company or farmland that actively delivers output and earnings.

          <p>A growing number of Gen Z women in the United States are identifying as "leftist" rather than liberal, signaling a significant political shift within the demographic. This trend is driven by a belief that the Democratic party is too centrist and has failed to address urgent issues like economic inequality, reproductive rights, and healthcare. Many young women feel their material conditions and personal safety are directly at stake, leading them to see moderation as a form of surrender. This leftward drift among women contrasts with Gen Z men, whose political views are more aligned with the national average.</p>

The study found that men are slightly more likely to remarry than women, and remarried households report a median net worth comparable to those in their first marriage, and significantly higher than divorced, single adults. Experts note that individuals entering a second marriage often do so with more foresight, frequently seeking prenuptial agreements.

          <p>An analytical article argues that the anti-Trump "Resistance" movement, often dismissed as performative or "cringe," derives its strength from its earnest and idealistic belief in American democracy. This sincerity serves as a powerful contrast to the nihilism and irony of the MAGA movement. While critics mock the aesthetics of the protests, the underlying civic engagement has led to tangible political victories, such as the 2018 midterm "blue wave." As the "No Kings" protests resume, the article suggests that this unironic, and sometimes uncool, idealism is a necessary tool for countering authoritarian tendencies and rebuilding a sense of political possibility.</p>
