          <p>Rachael De Foe, a 31-year-old from Singapore, successfully transitioned from a traditional nine-to-five public relations job to a "fractional" work model, more than tripling her annual income to approximately $220,000. After experiencing burnout in agency life, she founded her own company, Redefy, and now serves as the part-time head of communications for multiple businesses simultaneously. This arrangement provides her greater autonomy and fulfillment, allowing her to escape the high-pressure cycle of constantly needing to scale her team and client base.</p>

The victory was particularly notable as it came on the day the Aces' A’ja Wilson was celebrated for winning her fourth MVP award, and despite the Fever being significantly shorthanded with six players on the injury list.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight decline. The stability in China's rates, which was widely expected, comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently lowered its own rates, with investors now weighing the differing monetary policies of the world's two largest economies.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills involves more than teaching manners. The foundation is built early through modeling behaviors like talking openly about emotions, showing empathy in daily life, and validating a child's feelings. Other key practices include treating mistakes as learning opportunities, allowing children space to resolve their own conflicts, and listening more than lecturing, all of which foster emotional safety and authentic connection.</p>

          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has emphasized that reforming the welfare system "must happen" to address the rising cost of benefits and provide better support for people to return to work. The government aims to offer skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. This push for reform continues despite the government recently scrapping a controversial policy that would have cut disability benefits, highlighting the political and financial challenges of overhauling the system.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the illness. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice with a heritable immunity to the Lyme bacteria, which would break the infection cycle when ticks feed on them. Led by an MIT geneticist, the team is working closely with the community on Nantucket, an island with a high incidence of the disease, to ensure public buy-in before any potential release of the engineered animals.</p>
