          <p>Shares in Danish renewable energy company Orsted saw a significant jump of over 7% following a favorable U.S. court ruling. A judge overturned a Trump administration decision that had halted construction on the Revolution Wind project, a major offshore wind farm located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The ruling allows Orsted to resume work on the nearly completed project, providing a significant boost to the company and reflecting positively on the renewable energy sector's prospects.

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies surged to a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, a 10% increase from the previous year. This growth occurred despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back support for low-carbon projects, indicating strong underlying momentum in the sector. The report also notes that finance for wind power and electricity grids has seen significant increases, suggesting that the global transition to cleaner energy sources remains resilient and is continuing to attract substantial capital.

          <p>The article looks back 40 years to the 1985 Ryder Cup, when captain Tony Jacklin led Europe to its first victory in 28 years, a pivotal moment that saved the competition from fading into irrelevance due to decades of American dominance. Jacklin professionalized the European team, demanding first-class treatment and successfully convincing a reluctant Seve Ballesteros to rejoin the squad. This transformation culminated in the historic win at The Belfry, which shifted the balance of power and turned the Ryder Cup into the highly competitive global spectacle it is today.</p>

          <p>Struggling Chinese property developer Seazen Group is seeking another dollar bond deal, signaling a broader trend of mainland Chinese issuers returning to offshore bond markets. This renewed activity, with issuance reaching its highest level since 2022, suggests that financing channels are reopening after being largely shut down during the country's severe property crisis. The changing interest-rate environment is allowing companies to refinance on more favorable terms, potentially rebuilding investor confidence in a sector that had been considered highly risky.

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue, has stated that a much-anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to occur early next year rather than this fall. The comments came during a rare visit to Beijing by a bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers aimed at improving communication, particularly on military matters. Ambassador Perdue characterized the current relationship between the two leaders as "very good and very encouraging," suggesting a diplomatic path is being actively pursued despite ongoing tensions.</p>

          <p>An Australian pediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience has responded to recent claims linking paracetamol (acetaminophen) to autism, emphasizing the lack of causal evidence. The article argues that while the causes of autism are complex and often unknown, major studies have disproved a link with paracetamol, which remains a safe and essential medication for pregnant women. The author criticizes the spread of unscientific information, urging the public to trust established regulatory bodies like Australia's TGA, which have consistently affirmed the drug's safety based on rigorous scientific assessment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration restore $500 million in frozen federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The ruling for a preliminary injunction stated that the government likely violated federal law by not providing specific reasons for suspending the grants, which support critical medical research. The administration had suspended the funds over allegations of civil rights violations, part of a broader pattern of using federal funding to pressure elite universities it deems overly liberal.</p>

          <p>The article examines the resurgence of direct football tactics in the modern Premier League, noting similarities to the style famously employed by manager Sam Allardyce two decades ago. It highlights the increased emphasis on set-pieces, long passes from goalkeepers, and the use of tall, physical strikers, a departure from the possession-based game that has recently dominated. Allardyce reflects on being "ahead of the game" with methods that were once heavily criticized but are now being adopted by top clubs seeking tactical advantages.</p>

Abdel Fattah, who was convicted of "spreading false news," became a symbol of the widespread crackdown on dissent in Egypt, and his freedom was celebrated by his family and human rights advocates who had long campaigned for his release.</p>

The series, which stars David Tennant, will explore the troubling relationship between the press, police, and politicians that the scandal revealed. Thorne noted that unlike the Post Office scandal, which required a TV drama to gain widespread public attention, the phone hacking story is a celebration of how brilliant journalism successfully held its own powerful industry to account.</p>
