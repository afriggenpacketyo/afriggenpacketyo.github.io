          <p>The Supreme Court's decision to limit nationwide injunctions is being analyzed as a narrow, procedural victory for President Trump rather than a full endorsement of his birthright citizenship policy. This article explains that the ruling leaves the door open for future challenges, including class-action lawsuits, and may even benefit future Democratic administrations by reining in the power of single judges. The opinion focuses on the principle that judicial relief should be tailored to the specific plaintiffs in a case, creating a more complex legal landscape.</p>
