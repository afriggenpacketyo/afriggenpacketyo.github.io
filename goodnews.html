          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.485 billion euros, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and leading to a notable rise in its share price. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from a strong euro, the bank expressed confidence in meeting its full-year targets. The firm highlighted a 34% year-on-year increase in pre-tax profit and a solid capital ratio, though it noted a slowdown in corporate loan growth. The positive results come amid broader economic uncertainty in Europe, particularly concerning potential U.S. trade tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The transfer of English forward Marcus Rashford to FC Barcelona has generated significant discussion among fans and journalists in the Catalan capital. While Rashford offers tactical flexibility, able to play on the wing or as a striker, he was reportedly not the club's first choice and joins a well-stocked forward line. Commentators believe the move is a major opportunity for Rashford to revitalize his career after a period of poor form, though he will face stiff competition for a starting position. His arrival is also seen as a positive development, potentially encouraging more English players to join La Liga.</p>

          <p>As NFL training camps begin, several star players are not participating as they seek new contracts before the season starts, aiming to avoid injury while negotiations are pending. Notable holdouts include Dallas Cowboys' edge rusher Micah Parsons, who is citing back tightness but has previously indicated he would sit out for a new deal. Washington Commanders' receiver Terry McLaurin and Cincinnati Bengals' defensive end Trey Hendrickson are also holding out for extensions after strong recent seasons. The situations create uncertainty for their respective teams as they prepare for the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a major free trade agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, concluding nearly three years of negotiations. The deal will see India lower tariffs on British goods like cars and whisky, while the UK will increase imports of Indian products such as textiles. The UK government projects the agreement will boost its economy by £4.8 billion annually and increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion a year by 2040. Although signed, the pact will require parliamentary approval in the UK before it can take full effect.</p>

          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being celebrated in a new exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path." Raised in Lagos, Madu's work is deeply influenced by the city's vibrant culture, and he adds a modern West African perspective to Vincent van Gogh's iconic motifs. Both self-taught artists, Madu and Van Gogh share an influence from East Asian art, though Madu identifies with "Generation Manga." The exhibition showcases ten new large-format paintings, highlighting a cross-cultural dialogue between the two artists across different eras.</p>

          <p>China is actively seeking to advance its trans-Himalayan infrastructure and development projects with Nepal, signaling a continued effort to increase its influence in the region. A top Chinese official recently visited Nepal, emphasizing cooperation in agriculture, new energy, and health to boost Nepal's economy. This diplomatic push comes as China and India compete for strategic partnerships in South Asia. Although India has traditionally been Nepal's primary ally, Beijing's significant investments in infrastructure, from roads to hydropower plants, have drawn the landlocked Himalayan nation closer to China in recent years.</p>

The challenge, which took eight and a half years to complete, involved climbing each summit with his bike on his back before cycling down the treacherous paths. Green is believed to be only the second person in history to accomplish this, combining his passions for mountain biking and the outdoors. He described the logistics and time away from his family as the most difficult aspects of the epic undertaking.</p>

          <p>China is set to introduce a direct fiscal support program for its senior citizens, offering monthly electronic coupons to help cover the costs of elderly care. The policy aims to alleviate the financial burden on families, stimulate consumption in the senior-care sector, and address the challenges of a rapidly aging population. The allowances, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan per month, will be available to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This move is seen by economists as a step toward strengthening China's social safety net, which could help unlock domestic consumption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by a UK court. The ruling is a significant development in one of the major scandals of the post-financial crisis era and raises numerous questions. The decision may pave the way for at least seven other convicted traders to appeal their sentences. It has also led to renewed calls from senior politicians for a full public inquiry into the scandal, including the role that senior bank managers and central banks played.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, ruling the plan is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found that the order's interpretation, which would deny citizenship to many people born in the United States, violates the 14th Amendment. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place, preventing the administration from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are not citizens or permanent residents. The decision brings the contentious issue one step closer to the Supreme Court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a nationwide housing affordability crisis, a growing number of states are passing laws to override local zoning rules and compel cities to build more housing. In states like Utah, where the median home price is out of reach for most renters, the government has mandated that municipalities provide more affordable options and encourages denser development. This top-down approach aims to combat the "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) effect that often stalls new construction. However, these state mandates face pushback from local officials who are concerned about losing control over planning and infrastructure.</p>
