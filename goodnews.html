          <p>This article reviews the 2025 Polaris Slingshot 10, a limited-edition three-wheeled vehicle celebrating the model's tenth anniversary. The reviewer describes it as an addictive machine that offers a visceral driving experience, sitting somewhere between a car and a motorcycle. Powered by a 2.0-liter ProStar engine producing 204 horsepower, the vehicle is praised for its immediate response, precise handling, and modern technology, including a 7-inch touchscreen and premium audio system.

          <p>Joe Locke, star of the hit Netflix series "Heartstopper," is set to make his West End debut this autumn in the play "Clarkston." Written by Samuel D. Hunter, the play centers on two young men from different backgrounds who connect while working night shifts at a Costco in Washington state. Locke will play Jake, a young gay man with a degenerative disease, a role he says aligns with his interest in playing flawed, complex characters. The play explores themes of class, friendship, and platonic male love, and Locke is currently filming the "Heartstopper" movie before rehearsals begin.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 18:40:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has developed its own custom hardware, the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to cool the next generation of powerful and energy-intensive Nvidia GPUs. As the AI boom drives demand for these processors, cooling them has become a major challenge, with standard solutions being inadequate for AWS's scale. Instead of building new data centers for liquid cooling, Amazon engineered the IRHX to integrate into existing facilities. This move allows AWS to better support dense computing systems like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 and reflects the company's strategy of creating custom hardware to improve efficiency.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece analyzes Paris Saint-Germain's 4-0 victory over Real Madrid through the lens of its star forwards, Kylian Mbappé and Ousmane Dembélé. The article argues that the match showcased the superiority of PSG's collective system over Real Madrid's individualistic approach. While Mbappé struggled to make an impact against his former club, Dembélé was a standout performer, driving the team's press and contributing a key goal. The author suggests that PSG has successfully evolved into a cohesive machine without Mbappé, while his new team, Madrid, appeared shapeless and disorganized.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new record high on Wednesday, briefly trading above $112,000. The surge in the cryptocurrency's value was partly attributed to a broader rally in technology stocks, led by Nvidia, which temporarily hit a $4 trillion market capitalization. Although Bitcoin has traded in a narrow range recently, this new peak reflects continued bullish sentiment in the market. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential crypto-friendly legislation are creating expectations for further price increases throughout the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial state immigration law. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, makes it a felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter the state. A federal judge had previously blocked the law, ruling that it unconstitutionally encroaches on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain unenforceable while the legal challenge against it proceeds in the lower courts.</p>
