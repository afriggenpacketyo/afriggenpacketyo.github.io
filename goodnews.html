          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina early Sunday, with maximum sustained winds decreasing to 35 mph. The National Hurricane Center has discontinued all tropical storm warnings, though scattered showers, heavy rain, and potential flash flooding remain a threat for parts of North and South Carolina. The storm, the third of the Atlantic season, is expected to continue weakening as it moves inland and dissipate by Monday. Flood watches remain in effect for several areas, including Myrtle Beach and Raleigh.</p>

          <p>In a "Face the Nation" interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the White House will finalize several new trade deals this week ahead of a key deadline. For countries without an agreement, the administration will send letters outlining future steps, with President Trump making the final judgment on extending the current pause on tariffs. Hassett also defended the administration's new tax and spending bill, arguing that economic models predict it will generate 3% growth, covering its costs and shrinking the deficit, contrary to estimates from the CBO and other organizations. He dismissed concerns about millions losing Medicaid, asserting the bill's work requirements and job creation will increase insurance coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel secured a victory in the second stage of the Tour de France, narrowly defeating rival Tadej Pogacar in a dramatic sprint finish. The win on the 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer also earned van der Poel the coveted leader's yellow jersey. This marks a repeat of his 2021 victory on the same stage. Two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard finished third in the race, which is the longest stage in this year's tour, while British rider Oscar Onley achieved a notable sixth-place finish.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed an emotional first home victory at a chaotic and rain-soaked British Grand Prix. Norris capitalized on a 10-second penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri for erratic driving during a safety-car restart, passing him after the final pit stop. The win, celebrated in front of a record 500,000 weekend crowd, was described by a tearful Norris as a pinnacle achievement. In a surprising turn, Nico Hulkenberg secured his first-ever podium finish in his 239th race, holding off Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari to finish third for Sauber, while Max Verstappen finished fifth.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, a look back at the making of "Jaws" reveals the notoriously difficult production that birthed a Hollywood blockbuster. Director Steven Spielberg, then only 27, battled a malfunctioning mechanical shark and a ballooning budget while filming on the open Atlantic. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls initially turning down his role, fearing a troubled shoot, and believing the film would be a failure. Despite the on-set struggles and personality clashes, the movie became the first summer blockbuster, transforming the industry and cementing the legacies of its director and stars, who created a film that continues to terrify audiences today.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow's latest book delves into the complex life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the roots of his sardonic humor and enduring cultural impact. Chernow traces Twain's persona to a childhood marked by both adventure and the fear of poverty, which fueled a lifelong pursuit of wealth. The article highlights how Twain's work continues to resonate, with themes of politics, class, race, and get-rich-quick schemes remaining highly relevant today. Chernow argues that Twain, who called himself "the American," embodied both the best and worst of the national culture, using his fame to speak truth to power.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico in Peru's northern Barranca province, which is believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. The site, located 200km north of Lima, likely connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. Researchers say the discovery helps explain the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was impacted by climate change. The city features a central circular structure, ceremonial temples, and residential complexes, where artifacts like clay sculptures and seashell necklaces were unearthed, shedding new light on the region's ancient history.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, a gift from France, was originally conceived to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States, not as a symbol of immigration. However, its meaning was transformed over time, largely influenced by poet Emma Lazarus's 1883 sonnet "The New Colossus," which reimagined the statue as a "mother of exiles" welcoming the world's "huddled masses." The subsequent opening of the Ellis Island immigration facility nearby and the eventual end of restrictive ethnic immigration quotas in 1965 solidified Lady Liberty's modern identity as a powerful beacon of hope and a promise of welcome for immigrants arriving in America.</p>

According to the chairman of a regional Chinese chamber of commerce, American city leaders are actively seeking Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to stimulate their local economies. While potential Chinese investors are concerned about the geopolitical climate, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive. The urgency for Chinese companies to establish U.S. production has also increased due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, creating a complex dynamic between national rhetoric and local economic needs.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach highlights five common, overused phrases that can unintentionally make a person seem judgmental, potentially damaging professional and personal relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just…" and "Actually…" can come across as dismissive or condescending, while preambles such as "To be honest…" can imply prior dishonesty and put others on the defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity, collaboration, and humility, such as asking questions, using "yes, and..." to build on ideas, and framing opinions as one perspective among many. Adopting these more thoughtful communication habits can help build trust and respect.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly ramping up its political influence in the Western Balkans, using a combination of soft power and economic investment, a strategy some experts call "infrastructure imperialism." A key example is the new grand mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, which gives Turkey influence over its board. This religious outreach is coupled with major Turkish investments in infrastructure across the region, from railways to hotels. This strategy positions Turkey, under President Erdogan, as the heir to the Ottoman Empire and a growing regional power, projecting an image of a modern, influential nation.</p>

          <p>A key narrative driving the current stock market rally is the strong investor belief that the Federal Reserve will implement a significant number of interest rate cuts in 2026. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, the market appears to be pricing in as many as seven rate cuts for that year, creating a tailwind for valuations despite more cautious near-term guidance from the Fed. This forward-looking optimism is fueling investor confidence and buying activity, even with five months remaining in 2025 that hold potential economic and political volatility. The market's focus on a distant easing cycle highlights a powerful, if speculative, driver behind recent gains. (not investment advice)</p>
