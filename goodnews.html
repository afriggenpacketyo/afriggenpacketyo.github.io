          <p>Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to lead New York's Central Synagogue, is gaining global recognition for her sermons on empathy and inclusion. In a recent interview, she discussed her new memoir, 'Heart of a Stranger,' which explores her identity as a Korean Jew and how feeling like an outsider shaped her message of radical compassion. Buchdahl emphasized that empathy is not a betrayal of one's own side but a crucial reminder of shared humanity, a message she believes is vital amid rising antisemitism and political conflict. Her leadership is guided by the principle of creating a sense of belonging for all, drawing strength from the resilience she learned from her mother.</p>

          <p>As savers seek to maximize returns on their cash reserves, high-yield savings accounts offered primarily by online banks have become an attractive option, significantly outpacing traditional accounts. This article details eight of the best accounts available in October, evaluating them based on their Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), minimum deposit requirements, and accessibility. Options from institutions like Newtek Bank, BrioDirect, and Openbank are highlighted for their competitive rates, some exceeding 4.35%. The analysis provides a comparative look at the features and potential trade-offs of each account, such as withdrawal limitations or initial deposit amounts, to help consumers make informed decisions.

          <p>Researchers report a modest 2.1% increase in the North Atlantic right whale population, with the 2024 estimate reaching 384 individuals. The North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium described this slow growth as "positive news" for the critically endangered species, also noting that no deaths and fewer injuries have been reported this year. Despite this progress, conservation groups like Oceana and the Conservation Law Foundation are urging the federal government to implement stronger protections. They emphasize that the species remains dangerously close to extinction and requires immediate, robust intervention to mitigate threats from fishing gear entanglement and vessel strikes to ensure long-term recovery.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has announced the upcoming launch of its new artificial intelligence-powered web browser, named ChatGPT Atlas, causing shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to drop by 3%. The company teased the launch with a short video and a scheduled livestream, confirming the product will be available globally on macOS, with other platforms to follow. This move places OpenAI in direct competition with established browsers like Google Chrome and emerging AI-native browsers such as Perplexity's Comet. The launch signals a significant expansion for OpenAI as it vies for market share in a competitive landscape where AI integration is becoming a key feature for web navigation and personal assistance.</p>

          <p>A new conservative nonprofit, Americans for Ingredient Transparency, has launched a campaign advocating for a uniform national standard for ingredients in food, beverage, and personal care products. The group argues that the current patchwork of state-level regulations creates confusion for consumers and businesses. They are urging Congress and the Trump administration to implement reforms, including a consistent process for new ingredients and standardized front-of-package and QR code labeling. Supported by industry groups like the Consumer Brands Association, the initiative aims to provide clear, science-based information to help families make safe and informed choices about the products they purchase and consume daily.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Department of Defense to restore nearly 600 books discussing race and gender to school libraries on five military bases. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of 12 students who claimed their First Amendment rights were violated when the books were removed. The removals followed executive orders from President Trump and memoranda from the Secretary of Defense prohibiting materials promoting "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." The judge determined the removals were driven by improper partisan motivation rather than pedagogical concerns and mandated the immediate restoration of the books and related curricular materials.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly in discussions with Japan and South Korea to establish a trilateral currency swap agreement, aimed at strengthening the region's financial stability amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. According to a source, the governor of the People's Bank of China discussed the possibility with his counterparts during the recent IMF-World Bank meetings. Such an agreement would provide local currency liquidity and could offer financial relief during crises. The move aligns with China's long-term strategy to increase the international use of the yuan and foster deeper economic cooperation among the three East Asian economic powerhouses, which collectively represent a quarter of the global economy.</p>

The presentation was made by Nixon's daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and former national security adviser Robert O'Brien, among others. The recognition comes after Trump's central role in brokering the recent ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust, as part of the CNBC Investing Club, is selling 85 shares of Wells Fargo, reducing its position in the bank to 1,700 shares. The move is described as a disciplined profit-taking strategy following the stock's significant rally to new all-time highs after a strong third-quarter earnings report. Shares of Wells Fargo have increased by approximately 9% since the bank announced better-than-expected results, an aggressive share repurchase program, and an upgraded medium-term financial outlook. The sale, which realizes a gain of about 170% on shares purchased in 2021, does not reflect a change in the club's long-term positive view of the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Unlike previous cycles during major economic downturns, the current cuts are occurring in a relatively strong economy, creating a unique investment landscape. Advisors recommend a balanced approach, suggesting investors lock in yields on intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities of three to seven years to capitalize on current rates without taking excessive risk. They also emphasize the importance of maintaining a well-diversified equity portfolio across various asset classes rather than chasing high-flying sectors, ensuring participation in market shifts whenever they occur.

          <p>The fitness trend of wearing weighted vests to intensify workouts can offer benefits but also carries risks, according to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. He explained that the vests can help burn more calories and increase cardiac workload, but individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor before using them. While the impact on bone health is inconclusive, strengthening muscles with a vest may help prevent falls if used correctly. Dr. LaPook advises starting with a light weight, around 5% of body weight, and ensuring the vest fits properly to avoid putting undue stress on joints like the knees, ankles, and hips.</p>
