          <p>The IRS has announced increased capital gains tax brackets and various other tax provisions for 2026, including federal income tax brackets and the estate and gift tax exemption. Starting in 2026, single filers with taxable income of $49,450 or less, and married couples filing jointly with $98,900 or less, will qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains rate. These adjustments, which also include a rise in standard deductions, aim to update tax thresholds for the upcoming year. This development occurs as the agency navigates an ongoing government shutdown, impacting its workforce. (not investment advice)</p>

Roberson had been sentenced to death following his 2002 conviction for the capital murder of his daughter. This developing story indicates a temporary pause in the legal proceedings, likely allowing for further examination of his case.

Despite a continued decline in North American volume, the company's net sales rose 2.6% to $23.94 billion, with organic revenue increasing by 1.3%. CEO Ramon Laguarta highlighted a strategic shift towards smaller packaging to attract price-conscious consumers, which, while affecting volume, ultimately lifts revenue. The company also reiterated its full-year outlook, anticipating continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S. rare earth and critical mineral miners surged following China's imposition of tighter export restrictions on these crucial materials. Beijing now requires licenses for exporting products containing over 0.1% domestically sourced rare earths or using Chinese extraction technology. This move, seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains, has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will increase investment in developing a domestic supply chain. Rare earths are vital for U.S. weapons, robotics, and electric vehicles, making supply chain independence a national security priority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Ollie Watkins Set to Start for England in Absence of Injured Harry Kane</h2>

          <p>England head coach Thomas Tuchel is expected to give striker Ollie Watkins his first international start since November in the friendly against Wales. This opportunity arises due to captain Harry Kane's foot injury, though Kane hopes to be fit for the upcoming World Cup qualifier against Latvia. Watkins, a regular in the England squad since his 2021 debut, will likely lead the attack at Wembley. Despite a slow start to the season with Aston Villa, Watkins famously netted a 90th-minute winner in England's Euro 2024 semi-final triumph, demonstrating his capability on the international stage.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from a New Orleans prison in May, has been captured in Atlanta after five months on the run. Groves, a convicted murderer, was found in a crawl space after a multi-agency manhunt. The escapees had initially left taunting messages, and nine others were recaptured earlier. Groves now faces additional charges, including simple escape, with authorities also investigating potential upgrades to aggravated escape due to weapons and drugs found at the scene.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing real estate listings through "virtual staging," allowing sellers to digitally enhance property photos with trendy furniture and design elements. This cost-effective and rapid method helps buyers visualize potential homes, particularly for vacant properties. However, it raises concerns about transparency, with some realtors encountering listings where lawns, roofs, and facades were "virtually enhanced" without clear disclosure. Industry experts emphasize the need for clear labeling of AI-staged photos to prevent buyer disappointment and maintain trust, while acknowledging AI's growing role in real estate marketing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As smartphone addiction becomes a widespread concern, particularly among younger generations, some individuals are opting for "dumbphones" to regain control over their digital lives. These simplified devices, like the Light Phone, offer limited functionalities such as calls, texts, and basic tools, intentionally lacking internet browsing or social media. While transitioning can be logistically challenging in a smartphone-dependent world, users report improved sleep, increased presence, and a more intentional relationship with technology. This growing movement reflects a desire for digital minimalism and a rejection of the constant algorithmic engagement fostered by smartphones.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines has projected a better-than-expected close to 2025, driven by rising airfares and robust demand for luxury travel. The airline forecasts adjusted earnings between $1.60 and $1.90 a share for the fourth quarter, surpassing analyst estimates, with revenue expected to grow up to 4%. CEO Ed Bastian noted an uptick in cash sales since July and no signs of consumer pullback on premium products. This optimistic outlook suggests improved demand and a reduction in flight surplus, leading to a surge in Delta's shares and boosting other major airline stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) are presenting attractive investment opportunities with high interest rates that surpass current inflation, allowing savers to preserve buying power. These safe investments, typically FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000, enable individuals to lock in favorable rates for the CD's term. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates, with short-term CDs currently yielding higher returns due to an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to leverage these high short-term rates while planning for longer-term savings goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial educators are working to dispel common myths surrounding credit card debt, emphasizing that it doesn't necessarily indicate poor money management. Many individuals incur debt due to emergencies, unexpected expenses, or stressful life events, rather than reckless spending. Experts advocate for understanding debt as a tool when cash reserves are unavailable, encouraging people to have at least one credit card for building credit. The article highlights that escaping debt is achievable by focusing on creating a monthly surplus through budgeting or additional income, with many clients successfully eliminating significant debt amounts within months or years.

While cooperating closely with China on trade digitalization, a Kazakh official highlighted bottlenecks such as differing customs and logistics procedures. The World Bank projects a tripling of trade volumes along the Middle Corridor by 2030, with Kazakhstan expected to contribute significantly through exports. Realizing this transit potential necessitates substantial investment in infrastructure to support the anticipated increase in cargo, including a route to Pakistani seaports.</p>

Published in GigaScience, the research involved sequencing longer DNA fragments to produce a near-complete genome of the lizard. This discovery sheds light on how environmental factors like temperature, specifically 32 degrees Celsius or higher, can cause male embryos to develop as female. Understanding this genetic mechanism provides crucial insights into the complex interplay between genes and environment in sex determination among certain reptiles.</p>
