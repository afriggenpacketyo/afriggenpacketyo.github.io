          <p>Following his passing at age 91, industry experts are highlighting Giorgio Armani's visionary business strategies as being equally influential as his iconic fashion designs. Armani maintained complete control over his brand, avoiding mergers to ensure a consistent and classy vision across all his ventures, from luxury apparel to home goods and chocolates. He masterfully blended high fashion with accessible luxury, famously pioneering the power suit for both men and women, which reflected and responded to major cultural shifts like the feminist movement. His early and innovative use of celebrity endorsements, both on film and on the red carpet, was crucial in building his global, multibillion-dollar empire.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement in a class-action lawsuit brought by authors. The authors alleged that the company used pirated copies of their books, totaling an estimated 500,000 works, to train its AI chatbot, Claude. This settlement, which awaits judicial approval, is considered one of the largest copyright recoveries ever and could set a significant precedent for legal disputes between AI developers and content creators. As part of the agreement, Anthropic will also destroy the original book files it downloaded from pirate websites like Library Genesis.</p>

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed her sharp written exchange with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in a recent ruling. Barrett explained that her direct response was warranted by Jackson's own "spirited argument" in her solo dissent on a case limiting nationwide injunctions. She emphasized that their vigorous debates are confined to the legal merits of cases and do not reflect personal animosity, quoting her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia's philosophy of attacking ideas, not people. Barrett dismissed any notion of a "beef" between them, stressing that the justices maintain collegial and friendly relationships despite their disagreements.</p>

          <p>A significant week in technology, highlighted by a favorable remedies ruling in Google's antitrust case, added $420 billion to the market capitalization of the eight largest U.S. tech firms. This surge brought their combined value to an unprecedented $21 trillion, representing about 36% of the S&P 500. The court's decision not to force Google to sell its Chrome browser boosted both Alphabet and Apple, as it preserves their lucrative search default agreement. This development is seen as clearing the way for a deeper AI partnership between the two giants involving Google's Gemini models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for violating competition laws in the advertising technology sector. Regulators found that the tech giant unfairly favored its own advertising exchange, AdX, over rivals, which harmed competitors and publishers by increasing costs and reducing their revenues. The Commission has ordered Google to end these anti-competitive practices and has warned that a structural remedy, such as selling part of its ad tech business, may be necessary. Google has called the decision "wrong" and plans to appeal, while President Trump criticized the fine as discriminatory against American companies.</p>

The removal is necessary to accommodate a major reconfiguration of the airport's entrance roadways, a project designed to improve traffic flow and accessibility ahead of the 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics. The modernization effort aims to create dedicated, elevated roadways that separate airport traffic from local streets, significantly reducing congestion on Sepulveda Boulevard.

          <p>Following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point drop represents the largest one-day decrease in over a year, providing some relief to potential homebuyers facing high property prices. For a buyer of a median-priced home, this rate reduction could translate to a monthly saving of nearly $170. However, it remains uncertain whether this improvement in affordability will be enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand, which has remained sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In response to the resignation of his deputy prime minister, Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to recast his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer opted for a significant shake-up, appointing new individuals to the major offices of Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary. This move is seen as an attempt to seize a moment of crisis and re-energize his administration, which has faced declining approval ratings. The reshuffle is a significant exercise of prime ministerial authority, aimed at demonstrating a renewed focus on delivery and confronting a resurgent Reform UK party.</p>

          <p>Tesla's newly released "Master Plan IV" signals a significant strategic shift for the company, heavily emphasizing humanoid robots and autonomous robotaxis over the development of new electric cars. The document envisions a future of "sustainable abundance" enabled by AI and robotics, with little mention of new consumer EV models. This pivot aligns with CEO Elon Musk's long-stated belief that autonomous technology is Tesla's key to becoming a multi-trillion-dollar company. The plan emerges as Tesla's auto sales have slumped amid growing competition, suggesting the company is betting its future on a high-risk, high-reward move beyond its core car business.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal in the UK has ruled that an accountancy administrator was unfairly dismissed for personal internet use at work, awarding her over £14,000. Her employer had used spy software and fired her after finding she spent time on sites like Amazon and Rightmove. However, the judge determined that spending less than an hour on such activities was not excessive, especially since the company had no clear policy against it and her boss also engaged in personal computer use. The judge concluded the real reason for the dismissal was the owner's desire to fire her before she reached two years of service.</p>
