        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting that hundreds of Christmas markets across Germany have been canceled for 2025 has been proven false. A fact-check investigation revealed that the rumor originated from a single, unreliable online article that cited non-existent cancellations and security concerns. In reality, major cities like Berlin, Cologne, and Dresden are proceeding with their plans, and while a few small, local markets have been called off for isolated reasons like renovations or low revenue, there is no evidence of widespread closures. The vast majority of Germany's iconic Christmas markets are scheduled to open as usual.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As clocks go back, marking the start of longer winter nights, health experts are highlighting the challenges of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a type of depression linked to reduced daylight. In Scotland's northern isles, where daylight can shrink to just six hours, a new initiative is providing therapeutic lamps and "Wintering Well" boxes through local libraries to help residents cope. The project, led by the University of Glasgow, aims to shift attitudes towards winter by encouraging outdoor activity and creating comforting indoor light environments. This approach draws inspiration from Scandinavian cultures that embrace the season rather than just endure it.</p>

          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to determine the successor to Michael D. Higgins. Voters chose between two main contenders: independent politician Catherine Connolly, who is backed by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, a former senior cabinet minister. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot paper despite withdrawing from the race too late for his name to be removed. Early indications suggest that voter turnout for the election might be near the record low set in 2018, with the final result expected later in the day.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and deep understanding of the industry's core problems. His pre-seed investment proved prescient, as ElevenLabs has since achieved a multi-billion dollar valuation, specializing in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology. The story highlights the investor's strategy of identifying and backing highly technical founders in industries that are not yet considered mainstream or popular.</p>

          <p>As he departed for a five-day tour of Asia, President Donald Trump stated he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The trip, which includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, is primarily focused on trade, culminating in a high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to address the ongoing trade war. While U.S. officials have downplayed the likelihood of a summit with Kim, Trump's remarks have fueled speculation about a potential diplomatic opening. The tour underscores the administration's focus on economic and security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur is set to tackle pressing regional security issues, including the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. Hosted by Malaysia, the summit will be attended by numerous heads of state, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who is expected to help finalize a peace accord between the Thai and Cambodian governments. However, diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis in Myanmar have proven largely ineffective, and the bloc remains divided on how to handle the country's military junta. The summit will also mark a milestone with the official admission of Timor-Leste as ASEAN's 11th member.</p>

          <p>As high-level trade talks between the U.S. and China commence in Malaysia, Beijing's top envoy in Washington has called for cooperation over confrontation. The diplomat emphasized the need for "shared prosperity" and urged the U.S. to work with China based on principles of mutual respect and peaceful coexistence. These comments come ahead of a potential summit between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea next week, which is seen as a critical opportunity to de-escalate the trade tensions that have rattled global markets. The ongoing consultations aim to find a path forward amid the recent tit-for-tat tariffs and export controls.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for the New York City mayoral race, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani. The endorsement provides a major boost for Mamdani, a progressive assemblyman from Queens, just before the start of early voting. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers as reasons for his support. The backing from one of the most powerful Democrats in the country helps consolidate party support around Mamdani as he faces his opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in the general election.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and accounted for more than half of the nation's total population growth over the last quarter-century. Key findings show that U.S.-born Latinos are a significant driver of this growth, with a median age of just 20, indicating future expansion. The report also highlights that a large majority of Latinos are now U.S. citizens, with increasing rates of English proficiency and college education.</p>
