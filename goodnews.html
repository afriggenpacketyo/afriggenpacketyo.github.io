          <p>Taiwan's leader, William Lai Ching-te, has appointed two younger officials in their thirties, Lii Wen and Chao Yi-hsiang, as deputy secretaries general of the National Security Council. This move comes as Lai and his Democratic Progressive Party face declining approval ratings, particularly among young voters, following recent legislative setbacks. The appointments are seen as an effort to blend veteran experience with fresh perspectives, aiming to enhance Taiwan's ability to navigate complex geopolitical challenges involving Beijing and the United States. The new deputies have prior experience in international affairs and at the NSC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The final phase of England's expanded childcare support program has launched, offering working parents 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years. The government claims the scheme will save families thousands annually, but it faces significant challenges, including long waiting lists and a shortage of nursery staff and available places. Some parents have reportedly made decisions like scheduling C-sections to meet eligibility deadlines, highlighting the desperation for affordable care. Providers also warn that government funding rates are insufficient, forcing them to charge for extras to cover costs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of countries, including France, Slovakia, and Denmark, are proposing the elimination of public holidays as a measure to improve fiscal positions and increase productivity. Proponents argue that fewer non-working days could lead to a minor increase in GDP and tax revenue, with some citing the need to fund rising defense budgets. However, economists and policy analysts express skepticism, noting that productivity is driven more by factors like technology and worker skills than hours worked. Critics also warn that cutting holidays could increase worker burnout, potentially harming well-being and long-term productivity.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant reorganization of his Downing Street staff, creating new roles and clarifying existing structures to improve government efficiency. The shake-up includes appointing Darren Jones to the new position of Chief Secretary to the Prime Minister and bringing in economic experts like Baroness Shafik, a former Bank of England deputy governor. These changes are interpreted as an admission that the first year of his premiership has not gone as planned and reflect a strategic pivot to prioritize economic delivery ahead of the autumn Budget. The move aims to give Starmer firmer command over a government machine he has found unwieldy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland's national rail operator, ScotRail, has permanently abolished peak-time fares, making weekday commuter travel significantly cheaper in an effort to attract more passengers from cars to trains. Following a pilot program, the Scottish government has committed to funding the scheme, which could reduce some key commuter fares by nearly 50%. First Minister John Swinney stated the move is a sustainable investment in the rail network and provides financial relief to citizens. While the initial trial did not increase ridership enough to be self-financing, the government will cover the estimated £40-45 million annual cost from the ScotRail budget.</p>

          <p>Sonny Baker, a 22-year-old fast bowler from Hampshire, is set to make his debut for England in the first one-day international match against South Africa at Headingley. His selection follows impressive performances in The Hundred for Manchester Originals and for the England Lions team. The squad for the three-match series also sees the return of fellow fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse, who were previously sidelined with injuries. Baker's inclusion marks a significant step in his rapidly advancing career and positions him as a potential candidate for the upcoming Ashes tour.</p>

          <p>A Utah judge has thrown out the state's current congressional map, ruling it an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and ordering the Republican-led legislature to draw a new one. The decision could create a more competitive district for Democrats by consolidating the politically blue Salt Lake City area, which is currently split across four Republican-leaning districts. This development places the conservative state at the center of a national fight over redistricting, as both major parties seek to redraw maps in various states to gain an advantage ahead of midterm elections. The ruling stems from a voter-approved initiative from 2018 aimed at curbing partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order to temporarily halt the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied children back to Guatemala. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit, arguing the planned deportations were illegal and that planes were preparing for imminent departure. The judge's order prevents the deportations for at least 14 days, requiring the children to be returned to Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities while their cases are reviewed. This legal intervention highlights the ongoing conflict between the administration's immigration policies and legal protections for vulnerable migrants.</p>

          <p>South Korea's defense ministry has suspended its "Voice of Freedom" radio broadcast, a long-running psychological warfare program aimed at North Korea. This decision is the latest in a series of actions by President Lee Jae Myung's administration intended to de-escalate military tensions with its northern neighbor. The program, which began in 1962, broadcasted outside news and K-pop music into the heavily restricted country. In recent weeks, Seoul has also dismantled some of the propaganda loudspeakers along the border, though Pyongyang has so far shown little interest in reciprocating these peace-building efforts.</p>

The installation process involves drilling into the new building's signature concrete walls and applying a unique mineral-based glaze in three distinct colors—red, blue, and black—to the interior gallery surfaces instead of paint.
