          <p>NHS England will be the first country in the world to offer a gonorrhoea vaccine, starting in August, primarily targeting gay and bisexual men with multiple sexual partners or a history of STIs. The vaccine, originally designed for meningitis B, has shown 30-40% effectiveness against gonorrhoea. With gonorrhoea cases at their highest since 1918 and increasing antibiotic resistance, this initiative aims to reduce infections and ease pressure on sexual health clinics. Public Health Scotland is also planning a similar program, while health bodies in Wales and Northern Ireland are considering the move.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Sun-Times confirmed that a summer reading list featuring several fake book titles was generated using AI by a freelancer. The article, part of a special section, included nonexistent books by real authors, leading to criticism for lack of fact-checking. The publication has apologized, stating that the content was not editorial and was not approved by the newsroom. This incident highlights the challenges and risks associated with using AI in journalism, prompting the Sun-Times to update its policies regarding third-party content.</p>

          <p>China and the US have stepped back from the brink of a damaging trade decoupling, offering a collective sigh of relief to the global economy. The results from their Geneva negotiations sent ripples of confidence through financial markets, but the truce is merely a 90-day reprieve rather than a lasting resolution. The truce signals that neither side is willing ‚Äì nor prepared ‚Äì to sever economic ties completely. Most expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further once the 90-day period lapses.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks shares fell in extended trading despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter. The company's fiscal 2025 third-quarter revenue increased 15% year over year to $2.29 billion, exceeding estimates, and adjusted EPS increased 21% to 80 cents. The drop may be attributed to the company not raising its full-year outlook for key metrics like remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR. Palo Alto Networks has reached an inflection point in customer adoption for the security products that are critical to its future growth in the cloud-computing and artificial intelligence eras, according to CEO Nikesh Arora.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to construct a new missile defense shield called the "Golden Dome," estimated to cost $175 billion and be operational within three years. The project, led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to protect the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, even those launched from space. Experts cite advancements in technology since the 1980s as reasons for the project's feasibility. Critics question the steep price tag and whether the system can be fully developed within the given timeframe.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought to reassure farmers and one Republican senator about his upcoming report on how pesticides are driving up rates of childhood chronic diseases, acknowledging that chemicals like glyphosate that he has long criticized are widely used for growing crops in the U.S. Kennedy said at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee, that we cannot take any step that will put a single farmer in this country out of business, and that they were not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model. The White House in February tasked Kennedy with leading a "Make America Healthy Again Commission," which is producing a report assessing the threat of a range of issues that might be causing disease in children.</p>
