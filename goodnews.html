        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UEFA has delayed its decision regarding Crystal Palace's eligibility for the upcoming Europa League season due to its multi-club ownership rules. The club's participation is in question because co-owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. Complicating matters, Lyon was recently demoted to Ligue 2 for financial reasons and has agreed to forfeit its Europa League spot if its appeal fails. UEFA will wait for the outcome of Lyon's appeal before making a final ruling on Crystal Palace's status.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a link between age-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, and a deficiency in a particular protein, according to a new study on primates. The findings, published in the journal Nature Aging, provide a detailed molecular understanding of the aging process within the cochlea at a single-cell level. The study also found that the diabetes medication metformin was able to slow the progression of hearing loss in the monkeys. Scientists believe these discoveries could pave the way for developing new, personalized treatments for this common condition in humans.</p>

          <p>After decades of research, several companies, including Elon Musk's Neuralink and competitors like Precision Neuroscience, are close to commercializing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These surgically implanted devices translate brain signals into commands, enabling people with paralysis to control computers or generate speech with their thoughts. The technology has already been tested in dozens of individuals, with recent advancements allowing for wireless communication with smartphones and tablets. While challenges such as data processing and regulatory approval remain, the industry is on the verge of offering transformative products that could significantly improve the quality of life for people with severe disabilities.</p>

          <p>Interior designers are encouraging homeowners to view bathrooms as legitimate spaces for displaying art, moving beyond clich√©s and potty humor. Experts suggest that a well-chosen piece can serve as a focal point, making even small bathrooms feel more intentional and stylish. The advice is to treat the bathroom like any other room, embracing a wide range of art from personal mementos and whimsical paintings to more elegant works. Designers also offer practical tips, such as being mindful of moisture damage for valuable pieces, using art to complement or contrast with wallpaper, and propping up frames for a casual look.</p>

          <p>China is taking an aggressive, "no-holds-barred" approach to using artificial intelligence in its film industry, contrasting sharply with Hollywood's more hesitant stance. A Chinese government-backed foundation announced plans to use AI to revitalize 100 classic kung fu films, including creating an animated reinterpretation of John Woo's "A Better Tomorrow." This initiative highlights a significant divergence in attitudes, as U.S. guilds like the DGA express strong opposition to altering a director's original work. While Hollywood grapples with labor concerns and intellectual property rights, China sees AI as a powerful tool to enhance its cultural influence globally.</p>

          <p>A new law has taken effect in France banning smoking in many public outdoor spaces, including parks, beaches, swimming pools, and near schools. The measure, championed by the health minister, is aimed at protecting children from exposure to tobacco and is part of a broader goal to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While the ban has significant public support, some smokers view it as excessive, arguing there is enough space outdoors to smoke without bothering others. The law, which does not apply to e-cigarettes, imposes fines on violators as France continues its efforts to reduce its smoking rate.</p>

          <p>A trade agreement between the UK and the US has come into effect, reducing tariffs on key British exports like cars and aerospace products. The deal allows UK manufacturers to sell up to 100,000 vehicles to the US at a lower 10% tariff. In exchange, the UK will eliminate tariffs on US beef and ethanol imports, a move that concerns the domestic bioethanol industry. However, the agreement notably fails to address the 25% tariff on UK steel and aluminum, which could double to 50% if a separate deal is not reached by the July 9 deadline.

          <p>In a poignant meeting in Los Angeles, Andrew Roth, a 97-year-old Holocaust survivor, embraced Jack Moran, a 99-year-old U.S. Army veteran who helped liberate him from the Buchenwald concentration camp in 1945. Both men were teenagers when they experienced the horrors of World War II from vastly different perspectives. Roth had survived Auschwitz before being sent to Buchenwald, while Moran had fought in the Battle of the Bulge. Their reunion was organized by the USC Shoah Foundation, which is racing to collect the testimonies of the few remaining survivors and witnesses of the Holocaust.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Homicide Rates See Dramatic Decline, Researchers Link Trend to Pandemic's End</h2>

          <p>Homicide rates are falling significantly across the United States, with some analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024. Researchers suggest that a primary driver of this trend is the societal return to normalcy following the COVID-19 pandemic. The theory is that the pandemic disrupted crucial public services and support systems for young people, contributing to a spike in violence in 2020 and 2021. As local government employment and spending have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, community services and other programs that interrupt cycles of violence have been restored, contributing to the sharp decline in murders.</p>

          <p>As part of the "My Unsung Hero" series, Karen de Boer shares the story of a pivotal moment from her freshman year of college in 1990. After oversleeping and missing the bus for a prestigious choir performance, she was distraught, fearing she had ruined her chances with the group. Her hallmate, Pam, with whom she had a rocky relationship due to noise complaints, saw her distress. Despite their past friction, Pam immediately offered to drive her an hour to the church, getting her there just in time. De Boer reflects on this as a profound gift of forgiveness that has stayed with her for over 30 years.</p>

          <h2>Experts and Survivors Offer Advice on How to Best Support a Friend with Cancer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When a friend is diagnosed with cancer, many people struggle with what to say or do, often making well-intentioned mistakes. Cancer survivors and advocates advise against offering platitudes, sharing stories of others who died from cancer, or disappearing entirely, which can be deeply hurtful. Instead, the best support involves simply being present and listening without judgment, allowing the person space to vent their fears and frustrations. It is also more helpful to make specific offers of help, such as "Can I bring you a pizza on Tuesday?", rather than a vague "Let me know if you need anything."</p>
