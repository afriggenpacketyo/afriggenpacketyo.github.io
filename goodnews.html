          <h2>FDA Announces Stricter Standards for Covid Vaccine Booster Approvals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 13:03:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has released new guidelines for approving future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, imposing stricter standards for healthy Americans. The agency now requires new clinical trials to ensure the safety and effectiveness of Covid shots before approving them for healthy adults and children. This contrasts with the previous approach of approving updated shots based on antibody response tests. The FDA will use immunogenicity data for high-risk individuals but demands randomized, controlled trials showing clinical outcomes for healthy individuals, reflecting a balance between regulatory flexibility and rigorous scientific standards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk announced plans to significantly reduce his political spending, stating that he does not currently see a reason to invest further in politics. This decision comes after contributing at least $277 million to Republican candidates and causes in the 2024 cycle. Musk, who was tasked by President Trump to informally oversee the Department of Government Efficiency, has faced scrutiny for his leadership in government cuts. Tesla, one of his companies, has suffered a 71% drop in net income in the first quarter. However, Musk has also seen benefits for his other companies, such as Starlink, which has been approved for maritime and aviation use in Saudi Arabia.</p>

          <p>The European Union plans to impose a ‚Ç¨2 (US$2.25) flat fee on low-value packages entering the bloc, most of which originate from China. This fee aims to address challenges from the massive influx of inexpensive items. E-commerce platforms will be responsible for paying the levy per parcel, which removes the customs-free status of packages worth less than ‚Ç¨150 (US$168.75) that are imported directly to consumers. The EU suspects that platforms like Shein and Temu are not adequately preventing the sale of products that do not meet European standards.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and those at higher risk of severe disease but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials before approving them for wider use.

Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct "randomized, placebo-controlled trials" before the FDA approves future applications for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old.

          <p>Walmart has warned that higher duties on imports could lead to increased prices for its shoppers, a shift from its previous downplaying of tariff impacts. This announcement carries the risk of backlash from President Trump, who has a history of publicly criticizing companies opposing his agenda. Walmart's CFO stated that the magnitude of the tariff increases is more than any retailer can absorb. The company's shift in tone reflects a growing willingness among corporate leaders to publicly criticize Trump's trade policies, as tariffs directly affect business operations and consumer prices.</p>
