          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major new contract to supply semiconductors valued at approximately $16.5 billion, causing its shares to rise over 2% in early trading. The South Korean technology giant did not disclose the name of the other party involved in the substantial deal. This positive development comes as the company prepares to release its second-quarter earnings, where it anticipates a significant profit decline. The new contract provides a welcome boost amid struggles to compete with rivals in the booming artificial intelligence chip market.</p>

          <p>My Chemical Romance performed their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety to a sold-out crowd at Dodger Stadium, marking a new career peak for the influential emo band. The concert review highlights the group's enduring appeal, attributing it to their theatricality, frank lyrical themes, and influence on a new generation of artists. The performance featured elaborate staging, including a satirical narrative about a fictional dictator, but the core of the show's success was the power of the songs themselves. The band also played a selection of other hits, reaffirming their powerful connection with their dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France, cementing his status among the sport's legends. Despite treacherous, rainy conditions and having already effectively secured the overall victory, Pogačar launched a characteristic attack in the final stage in Paris. Although he did not win the stage itself, which went to Belgian rider Wout van Aert, his aggressive style was a testament to his competitive spirit. The 26-year-old finished the grueling three-week race significantly ahead of his main rival, two-time champion Jonas Vingegaard, who placed second overall.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese position player to be enshrined, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame alongside dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and elite closer Billy Wagner. Suzuki, who received 99.7% of the vote, was celebrated for his remarkable career spanning both Japan and MLB, where he amassed over 3,000 hits. Sabathia, a Cy Young Award winner and six-time All-Star, reflected on his decision to join the New York Yankees, a move he said defined his career. Wagner, inducted in his final year of eligibility, became the ninth relief pitcher to enter the Hall.</p>

          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean nations are experiencing a significant increase in demand for their "citizenship by investment" (CBI) programs, largely driven by wealthy Americans. For an investment starting around $200,000 in real estate, individuals can obtain a passport offering visa-free travel to numerous countries, including the UK and Europe's Schengen area. Political instability, gun violence, and tax benefits are cited as key motivators for US citizens seeking a second passport as an "insurance policy." While these programs are a vital source of revenue for the island nations, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over security and financial crime concerns.</p>

As part of the agreement, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in US energy products and investing $600 billion in the US over three years. While European leaders expressed relief at achieving stability, the deal creates a new tariff reality that is higher than pre-Trump levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Excavations in the village of Keeladi in Tamil Nadu, India, have unearthed artifacts suggesting a literate, urban civilization existed there as far back as 2,500 years ago. These findings are challenging the long-held historical narrative that ancient Indian civilization primarily originated and spread from the north. The discovery has become a point of immense regional pride and a political flashpoint, fueling debates between state and federal archaeological bodies over the interpretation and significance of the finds. For many, Keeladi represents a crucial rewriting of Southern India's place in the subcontinent's ancient history.</p>

The race's key turning points included Norris's imperfect restart and a strategic tire choice divergence during the pit stops.

The film, which is set in a retro-futuristic 1960s, also grossed $100 million internationally for a worldwide total of $218 million.
