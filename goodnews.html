          <p>Zia Yusuf is returning to Reform UK as the leader of its "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, just two days after resigning as chairman. Yusuf initially cited that working to get the party elected was not a good use of his time, but later expressed regret, attributing his decision to exhaustion after 11 months of volunteer work. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf will take on a more public role, appearing more frequently in the media. Yusuf had previously criticized Sarah Pochin's call to ban the burka, emphasizing the need for party alignment. </p>
