        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling that suggests Federal Reserve board members would have greater protection against presidential firings. The ruling came in a case where President Trump fired members of other federal agencies' boards, but the court explicitly addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. The court emphasized the Federal Reserve's unique structure as a quasi-private entity, indicating that any presidential attempt to remove a board member would likely face strong legal challenges. The three liberal justices dissented, but the majority opinion signaled a continued resistance to presidential overreach into the Federal Reserve's operations.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be at their lowest level since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging around $3.08 per gallon. This is significantly lower than the $3.58 per gallon average from Memorial Day 2024. GasBuddy forecasts prices to remain relatively low throughout the summer, potentially dipping below $3 a gallon towards the end of the season. The lower prices are attributed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. Despite lower gas prices, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased.</p>

The remark underscored global perceptions of Trump's affinity for personal gifts and financial dealings. While Ramaphosa brought a golf book and South African guests to appeal to Trump, the incident highlighted concerns about potential influence peddling through Trump's businesses and cryptocurrency ventures. Critics have pointed to increased membership fees at Trump's clubs and business dealings involving his sons as examples of profiting from the presidency.</p>

          <p>Jean Paul Al Arab, a student at the University at Buffalo, was chased by police across the graduation stage while carrying his 6-month-old son, Mtanos.

Despite the chaos, Al Arab received his diploma and started a GoFundMe to help other student parents. The university stated that its rules only allow the student receiving the diploma to walk across the stage, but Al Arab will still receive his degree.</p>

          <p>A new observational study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly used as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers. The study found a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause in patients taking GLP-1s compared to those taking DDP-4 inhibitors. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had a notable reduction in risk. Researchers hope to continue their research with a larger sample size and including individuals without diabetes.</p>

While families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, concerns have been raised about whether the accounts would provide sufficient funds for low-income families.
