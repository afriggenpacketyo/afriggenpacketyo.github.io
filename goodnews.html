          <p>After 74 years of scientific research and expeditions, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in southern Tibet. The initiative, announced by Premier Li Qiang, is set to become the world's largest hydropower dam. The project's origins trace back to the first comprehensive scientific expedition to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1951, which laid the groundwork for understanding the region's geology and hydrology. The dam's construction represents a monumental engineering feat and a culmination of long-term strategic planning by the Chinese government to harness the river's immense power potential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union is being hailed as a significant victory for the Trump administration, though it is not a complete loss for Brussels. The deal sets a 15% U.S. tariff on many European goods, which is lower than the threatened 30% but still a substantial increase from previous levels and higher than the UK's 10% rate. In return, the EU has committed to significant purchases of American exports and will continue to face a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum. The agreement averts a full-blown trade war, providing economic stability that the EU deemed worth the price of the concessions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material, which had a collective membership of over 120,000 users. The investigation, dubbed Operation Grayskull, has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led and utilized the network to trade millions of illicit files. Among those convicted is William Spearman, labeled one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. Officials described the operation as one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community and preventing the regeneration of these abusive platforms.</p>

          <p>The tech hub of Shenzhen, China, has implemented new regulations mandating leniency for researchers and innovators whose state-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The rules apply to all government-funded technical innovation projects at universities, hospitals, and companies. As long as the failures do not involve misconduct or abuse of power, and reasonable corrective actions were taken, individuals will not be held accountable or have their performance evaluations negatively affected. This policy aims to encourage bold exploration in science and technology by reducing the fear of failure, fostering a more risk-tolerant environment for groundbreaking research.</p>

          <p>The LAPD's Pacoima station was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in military ordnance they had found while cleaning out a deceased relative's home. The bomb squad was called to the scene and used a robot to assess the devices, which were contained in a plastic box. After determining the explosives were safe to move, they were transferred to a secure storage facility for collection by the U.S. military. The incident, which also prompted the evacuation of nearby homes as a precaution, was resolved without any injuries or detonations, occurring less than two weeks after a separate explosion killed three L.A.

Countries like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and St. Kitts and Nevis are attracting wealthy buyers, particularly from the U.S., who are reportedly motivated by political and social volatility at home. For an investment starting as low as $200,000, buyers gain a passport with visa-free access to up to 150 countries.

Excavations have unearthed artifacts suggesting a literate, urban settlement existed there as early as 580 BCE, challenging established timelines of civilization in the subcontinent. Some experts and politicians in the southern state claim the findings prove that a sophisticated Tamil civilization is as old as, or even older than, the Vedic culture of northern India. The controversy has been fueled by accusations that the federal government is attempting to suppress the findings to maintain a north-centric historical narrative.</p>
