          <p>A small marble sculpture, initially believed to be a copy of Auguste Rodin's work, has been authenticated as a genuine piece by the French artist and sold for nearly $1 million at auction. The sculpture, titled "Despair," depicts a woman hugging her knees and holding one foot. The work, created in 1892, had disappeared after being sold at an auction in 1906, resurfacing and delighting its owners after the Comite Rodin confirmed its authenticity following a six-week investigation. The piece was described as an "extremely rare" find by the French auctioneer.</p>

          <p>WWE's Worlds Collide event, a crossover with AAA, broke records for live viewership on YouTube, celebrating Mexican lucha libre. The event was well-received, with the transmission viewed by over 4.1 million people in the first 24 hours. However, the Money in the Bank ladder matches were controversial, particularly the men's match, which saw Seth Rollins win despite fan support for LA Knight. The unexpected return of R-Truth at Money in the Bank added excitement and appeased fans, as WWE may have reconsidered letting him go after seeing the negative reaction.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Reeves hailed the project as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Miliband said nuclear energy would deliver a golden age of clean energy abundance. However, the project faces opposition from groups like Stop Sizewell C, who believe it is a costly mistake that will add to consumer bills. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>
