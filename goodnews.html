          <p>In anticipation of the 2026 California gubernatorial race, a recent article interviewed numerous candidates regarding their assessments of Governor Gavin Newsom's and the state Legislature's performance. The candidates offered diverse perspectives, with some commending Newsom's assertive stance against the Trump administration and his efforts to address the state's persistent housing crisis. Conversely, others voiced criticisms concerning the pace of progress on major infrastructure projects like high-speed rail and the duration of school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article provides a valuable overview of the complex issues and differing political philosophies that are currently shaping the competitive landscape of the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer presented a detailed argument differentiating the current artificial intelligence boom from the speculative dotcom bubble of 2000. He highlighted that today's leading technology companies, such as Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, possess substantial financial resources and are making genuine, strategic investments in AI infrastructure, unlike many of the financially precarious dotcom firms. Cramer expressed a cautious optimism that these tech giants are well-positioned to adapt and succeed as AI technology continues to advance, given their robust cash reserves. However, he also stressed the importance of continued investor scrutiny and skepticism to prevent the market from becoming overvalued and to ensure sustainable growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to strategically curb the output growth of primary non-ferrous metals to a modest 1.5% this year, a significant reduction from the previous year's 4.3%. This policy shift signals a move away from sheer production volume towards optimizing the industrial structure, with a target of approximately 5% annual growth in value-added output. The plan further prioritizes advancing the exploration of critical minerals like copper, lithium, and nickel, developing cutting-edge rare earth materials, and enhancing the recycling of used batteries and solar panels. This comprehensive approach aims to alleviate intense market competition and address the challenges of depressed processing fees that have squeezed smelter margins.</p>

In contrast, U.S. Captain Keegan Bradley faced criticism for his self-focused approach and misjudgments regarding the course setup, which ultimately backfired.
