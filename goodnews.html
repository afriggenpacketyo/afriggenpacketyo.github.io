          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, such as the director of the National Portrait Gallery, following President Trump's announcement of the director's firing. The Smithsonian's statement emphasized that the institution is governed by a Board of Regents and a Secretary, who manages the institution independently. This announcement followed a Board of Regents meeting to discuss the director's fate after Trump's social media post criticizing her as partisan and a supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian's move comes amid proposed budget cuts and an executive order demanding an end to federal funding for exhibitions based on racial themes, which could be seen as a rejection of political interference.</p>

          <p>Top officials from China and the United States are engaged in a second day of negotiations in London, aiming to de-escalate trade and technology tensions that have impacted the global economy.

President Trump has authorized the American delegation to negotiate away restrictions on the sale of advanced technologies to China, including jet engines and design software. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, expressed optimism for a swift resolution involving handshakes and the release of rare earths.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros Discovery, the owner of CNN and HBO Max, has announced its intention to split into two separate companies by the middle of next year. The media giant plans to separate its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This move comes as streaming services gain popularity while cable TV audiences decline, with HBO Max finding success with shows like Succession and The White Lotus. The new Streaming & Studios business will be headed by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks company, including CNN and Discovery, will be led by Gunnar Wiedenfels.</p>

The initial launch will involve only 10 self-driving electric vehicles, and riders will need an invitation from the company. This move could be a significant development for Tesla, which is focusing on driverless vehicles and artificial intelligence amid fluctuating stock prices and increased competition in the EV market. While Waymo already offers an autonomous taxi service in Austin, Tesla's entry into the market could further advance the adoption of self-driving technology.</p>

          <p>A group of cross-party MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as "one of the worst in the developed world" and fundamentally flawed. A report by the Women and Equalities Committee states that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes" and require bold action, necessitating significant investment. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks in a phased approach. Introduced in 2003, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower.</p>

Teachers are also permitted to use AI for routine letters to parents, with transparency about AI use being essential.
