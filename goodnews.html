          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates to their lowest point since April has triggered a significant increase in refinancing applications. The Mortgage Bankers Association reported a 7% weekly rise in these applications, which are now 40% higher than the previous year, particularly driven by conventional and VA loan holders. However, this trend has not translated to home purchasing, as applications for new home mortgages remained nearly flat, indicating ongoing uncertainty among potential buyers in the housing market.

          <p>Chinese tech company Honor has launched its new Magic V5 foldable phone, aiming to challenge market leader Samsung with a device that it touts as exceptionally thin and featuring a large-capacity battery. Initially launching in China, the phone is part of Honor's strategy to stand out in the competitive but small foldable market, which is currently dominated by Samsung and Huawei. Analysts note that while the Magic V5's features are impressive, Honor faces a significant challenge in competing with Samsung's global brand recognition and distribution network.</p>

          <p>China appears to be on the verge of a landmark satellite servicing mission in geostationary orbit, an ambitious technological feat not yet achieved by the United States. Recent tracking data shows two Chinese satellites, including the Shijian-25 probe, in close proximity, suggesting a potential docking and refueling test is imminent. According to Chinese state media, the mission is designed to verify technologies for on-orbit maintenance and life extension of satellites, which could significantly reduce costs and help manage the growing problem of space debris.</p>

          <p>Virtual YouTubers, or "VTubers," are AI-powered animated personalities who are building massive online followings and generating millions in revenue. Characters like Bloo, created by a human YouTuber, use AI for tasks like voice dubbing and video thumbnail generation, though a human still controls the primary performance. This trend is fueled by advances in generative AI from companies like Hedra and OpenAI, which are making it easier to create content without appearing on camera, while also raising concerns about a flood of low-quality "AI slop."</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed an ambitious climate target to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by the year 2040, compared to 1990 levels. To ease the transition for industries and address concerns from some member states, the plan includes new flexibility, allowing the use of carbon credits from non-EU countries to count for up to 3% of the reduction. Officials described the proposal as a pragmatic and realistic path toward the bloc's goal of achieving full decarbonization by 2050, balancing environmental commitments with economic competitiveness.</p>

          <p>As the first generation raised with constant digital exposure to global crises, Gen Z is grappling with a profound sense of uncertainty and inheriting what many feel are broken systems. This article explores their coping mechanisms, which range from using wry humor on social media to address war and conflict, to delaying traditional adult milestones like homeownership due to economic instability. While many report high levels of anxiety, others are responding by taking agency, pursuing entrepreneurship, and focusing on impact-driven work to create a better future.</p>

          <p>A Beijing-based think tank, China Finance 40 Forum, is challenging the consensus view that China's consumption is underdeveloped, arguing that its actual purchasing power is systematically underestimated by mainstream metrics. The report contends that when adjusted for the cost of living, China's per capita consumption is already 40 to 50 percent of levels in developed nations like Japan and Germany, and has surpassed that of Mexico. This alternative perspective suggests a greater consumer potential for the world's second-largest economy than is commonly believed. (not investment advice)</p>

An Israeli official confirmed there is majority government support for a framework to release hostages, a key demand for Israel.

          <p>Fiji's Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has firmly stated his opposition to China establishing a permanent military presence in the South Pacific, emphasizing the region should remain an "ocean of peace." Speaking in Australia, Rabuka asserted that Fiji would not welcome such a development and believes China understands this position. His comments come as China continues to expand its influence across the Pacific through significant investments and infrastructure projects, which have led some nations like the Solomon Islands to forge closer security ties with Beijing.</p>
