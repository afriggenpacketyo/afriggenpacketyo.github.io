          <p>Paleontologists have identified one of the most unusual dinosaurs ever found, a 165-million-year-old ankylosaur named Spicomellus. Newly discovered fossils from Morocco reveal that this herbivorous dinosaur had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any known vertebrate. Researchers have dubbed the creature the "punk rocker" of its time due to its elaborate armor and tail weapon. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, suggesting their defensive features were far more complex at an earlier stage than previously believed, prompting a potential reassessment of their evolutionary timeline.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent Personal Consumption Expenditures data indicates that U.S. inflation held steady at a 2.6% annual rate in July, with core inflation slightly increasing to 2.9%. Despite these persistent price pressures, consumer spending rose by 0.5%, suggesting Americans are maintaining their purchasing habits amid economic uncertainty. However, many consumers are making trade-offs, cutting back on discretionary spending like travel and dining. Analysts believe this data keeps the Federal Reserve on track to consider an interest rate cut in September, as the impact of recent tariffs on prices has so far been minimal, though that could change in the coming months.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won his re-election bid by a significant margin, securing his position four years after facing opposition that he says locked him out of the town hall. The election, the town's first since the 1960s, was held under a federal settlement following a lawsuit by Black residents who challenged the town's history of "hand-me-down governance." For decades, Newbern's white-majority government appointed successors without holding public elections. Braxton's decisive victory is seen as a major step toward restoring democratic processes and ensuring fair representation in the small, majority-Black town.</p>

Swift was seen wearing her new, large Old Mine Cut diamond engagement ring, which was reportedly co-designed by Kelce and jeweler Kindred Lubeck. The couple, joined by Travis's brother Jason, watched their alma mater, the University of Cincinnati Bearcats. The high-profile engagement has drawn widespread media attention, with speculation about the custom ring's value ranging widely, and has even prompted commentary from public figures about its potential influence on the upcoming NFL season.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on original music and smaller, more intimate tours, "Weird Al" Yankovic has returned to his signature large-scale parody shows with his "Bigger & Weirder" tour. The musician explains that he stepped away from parodies partly because the pop music monoculture has fragmented, but also to prove he was more than just "the parody guy." Having successfully explored other creative avenues, including co-writing an Emmy-nominated satirical biopic, he is now re-embracing the elaborate costumes, props, and video screens his fans love.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a joint cabinet meeting aimed at repairing and strengthening the relationship between their two nations. The meeting sought to present a united front on critical issues such as the war in Ukraine, trade, and European defense, marking a shift from the previously strained relations under former Chancellor Scholz. Key agreements were reached on energy policy, with Germany dropping its opposition to France's pro-nuclear stance at the EU level. While the leaders projected a warm rapport, significant disagreements on joint military projects and trade deals remain, and Macron faces a looming no-confidence vote at home.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Japan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for greater collaboration between India and China, stating that stable and amicable ties are crucial for a "multipolar Asia and world." In an interview, he emphasized that a positive relationship between the two most populous nations could significantly impact regional and global peace and prosperity. This statement signals a potential warming of relations with Beijing, which contrasts with India's recent efforts to position itself as a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region, often in closer alignment with the United States and its allies.</p>

Alcaraz, who won his first Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2022, briefly received treatment on his right knee during the second set but stated afterward that he was not concerned about it.

          <p>Canadian Colombian singer Tei Shi has released her fourth studio album, "Make believe I make believe," her most personal and versatile project to date. The album was self-released after the artist departed from her previous record label, giving her complete creative control to explore her multicultural identity. The record features songs in both English and Spanish, blending dream-pop, indie folk, and neo-perreo sounds into a style she calls "Canadianatón." This new work builds on the artistic freedom she first embraced with her 2024 LP, "Valerie," and is accompanied by the announcement of an upcoming North American headline tour.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining elevated despite anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, seniors have several options to tap into their home equity without refinancing their existing loans. One key option available only to homeowners aged 62 and older is a reverse mortgage, which converts equity into payments for the homeowner and does not require monthly repayment. Other viable methods include home equity loans, which currently offer declining fixed interest rates, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line with variable rates. Each option presents different benefits and risks for homeowners looking to leverage their property's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put on the market for the first time in generations. High-end real estate brokers report that as families expand and heirs become geographically scattered, disagreements over the future of these properties often lead to a decision to sell. This trend is meeting strong demand from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who are seeking privacy, open space, and a connection to nature. While these legacy properties can command premium prices, the sales often represent a bittersweet end to a family's long-standing connection to the land.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 people from Venezuela. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority in attempting to end the protections. The court noted that the TPS statute was designed by Congress to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics. This ruling provides a crucial, though potentially temporary, reprieve for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who were facing the loss of their legal status to live and work in the United States.</p>

According to the Schertz Police Department, one student expressed the desire to carry out the attack, while a second student suggested he could provide the necessary weapons. The plot was thwarted when a third student overheard the conversation and reported it to school administrators, who then contacted law enforcement.

          <p>California's governor and legislative leaders have announced a compromise deal with Uber and Lyft that will permit rideshare drivers to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. A key aspect of the agreement is that drivers will retain their classification as independent contractors, a status the companies fought to secure with the passage of Proposition 22 in 2020. The deal involves advancing a collective bargaining bill sponsored by labor unions alongside a separate bill, backed by the companies, that significantly lowers their insurance coverage requirements. This marks a major development in the ongoing debate over labor rights for gig economy workers.</p>
