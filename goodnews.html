          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, stating that the changes require Congressional approval. The ruling supports a lawsuit filed by unions and local governments, arguing that the administration's actions were unlawful and disruptive. The judge emphasized the need for cooperation between the executive and legislative branches for large-scale reorganizations. The ruling impacts the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and prevents further layoffs while a hearing for a potential preliminary injunction is scheduled.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, raising concerns about where it might land. Launched in 1972, the spacecraft malfunctioned and has been adrift in space for over five decades. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur soon, but the exact timing and location remain uncertain. Despite the spacecraft's protective heat shield, designed for Venus's atmosphere, there is a chance it could partially survive re-entry. The risk of injuries on the ground is considered low, though recovered pieces would legally belong to Russia.</p>

Buseoksa Temple in South Korea had claimed ownership, asserting the statue was looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. After a series of court rulings, including a Supreme Court decision, the statue was finally handed over, resolving a historical and cultural dispute between the two countries.</p>

Vaughan was initially banned for improper conduct after questioning the rival player's gender during a match. However, an FA appeal board later found that Vaughan had received an "unfair" hearing and quashed the original ruling, and the case has since been dropped after the complainant withdrew from the process. Vaughan asserts that the case has significantly impacted her life and believes the FA should not have pursued the matter.</p>
