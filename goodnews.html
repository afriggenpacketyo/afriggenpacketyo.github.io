          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Mr. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, with experts noting that survival rates for similar diagnoses have significantly improved in recent years, with some patients living five, seven, or even ten years or more. The article notes that both President Trump and Vice President Harris issued supportive statements regarding the former president's health. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reportedly reached an agreement to reset relations after Britain's exit from the European bloc in 2020. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in London for a summit where the deal was finalized. The agreement includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 30, 2038, cooperation on energy, and a security and defense partnership. Additionally, both sides will work toward a youth mobility scheme allowing young people to live and work across the continent and will explore the use of e-gates for UK passport holders at European airports. The Trump administration's recent shift toward U.S. isolationism when it comes to global affairs, and particularly those more acutely affecting Europe, such as the war in Ukraine, make the case for an ambitious reset.</p>

          <p>Paris-Orly airport experienced cancellations and delays after a breakdown in air traffic control systems. The French civil aviation authority stated that the situation is improving, but airlines have been asked to reduce flights by 15% on Monday, down from a 40% reduction on Sunday. Flights to Italy, Spain, Portugal, and southern France have been notably affected, and the DGAC did not provide details on the cause of the breakdown. More than 33 million passengers traveled through Paris-Orly airport last year, about half the number at Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle, according to figures released by the operator Aeroport de Paris.</p>

          <p>Five years after Brexit, Britain and the European Union are engaging in their first summit since the split, signaling a potential shift towards renewed cooperation amidst global uncertainties.

          <p>Top officials from Britain and the European Union are convening in London to discuss the future of their relationship post-Brexit. The summit is framed as a major reset, especially significant given the shifting global landscape where America is seen as a less reliable ally. Discussions are expected to focus on a defense and security partnership, trade, and collaboration on geopolitical issues. Key sticking points include fishing rights and youth mobility schemes, with the ultimate goal of strengthening the partnership for mutual benefit. This is all happening as Trump and the US are seemingly less interested in global affairs.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to fall in July, marking the first drop in the regulator Ofgem's price cap for a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by ¬£129 a year, a drop of nearly 7%. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill, so actual savings will depend on individual consumption.</p>
