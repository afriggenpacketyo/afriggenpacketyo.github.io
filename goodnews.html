          <p>Alibaba's Hong Kong-listed shares climbed over 6%, reaching their highest point since 2021, following CEO Eddie Wu's announcement of significantly increased investment in artificial intelligence. The company plans to expand its existing 380 billion yuan (US$53 billion) three-year AI infrastructure initiative, positioning Alibaba Cloud as a "full-stack AI service provider" for training and deploying large AI models. Wu emphasized the anticipated "artificial superintelligence" era, projecting over $4 trillion in global AI investment in the next five years. This strategic focus, coupled with the unveiling of the Qwen3-Max large language model, aims to leverage AI's transformative potential across various sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Datong, a city in northern China's Shanxi province, successfully navigated severe summer floods, avoiding disaster despite prolonged upstream flood discharges. This resilience is credited to a long-term infrastructure project spearheaded by former mayor Geng Yanbo over 15 years ago, which involved widening the city's main waterway. The initiative, initially deemed a waste by some residents, is now recognized as crucial for urban flood preparedness. Economists note that such investments not only improve long-term city resilience but also provide short-term economic stimulus, aligning with Beijing's recent allocation of 1 trillion yuan for disaster prevention and relief.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, securing the seat left vacant by her late father and further shrinking the Republican's razor-thin House majority. Grijalva, a former Pima County supervisor, achieved victory in the left-leaning, Hispanic-majority district with strong support from progressive figures. Her win narrows the GOP's House control to 219-214, with two other seats awaiting special elections. Grijalva campaigned on fighting President Trump's agenda, particularly regarding healthcare, and committed to signing a discharge petition for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>USC's football team faces considerable uncertainty regarding the availability of key players Ja’Kobi Lane and Elijah Paige as they approach a critical stretch of their conference schedule. Star wideout Lane, sidelined last Saturday with an upper body injury, returned to practice but his game status remains ambiguous. Starting left tackle Paige was absent from practice after an early exit from the previous game, prompting significant adjustments to the offensive line. Coach Lincoln Riley deferred official updates to the Big Ten's availability report, underscoring the team's challenges despite its offense demonstrating resilience in recent games.</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw has publicly defended his choice to miss a crucial game with playoff implications to attend a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Shaw, who shared a bond with Kirk through their Christian faith, stated he felt it was his duty to be present, despite the Cubs' subsequent loss and the advantage it gave to a rival team. He communicated his decision to his teammates and manager, acknowledging potential criticism but prioritizing his personal convictions. While some sports commentators found the absence unusual for a non-family emergency, Shaw's teammates expressed understanding for his personal commitment.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has made a notable shift in his rhetoric regarding the war in Ukraine, now asserting that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with support from Europe and NATO, attributing this potential to Russia's economic difficulties. This statement, delivered after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, contrasts with Trump's earlier suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Zelenskyy hailed this "big shift" as a positive signal of sustained US commitment. Trump also advocated for NATO nations to shoot down Russian aircraft that violate their airspace, indicating a hardening stance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is planning to replace both its C-17A Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo planes with a single Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) platform by the mid-2040s. Air Mobility Command head Gen. John Lamontagne stated the new aircraft will prioritize greater speed, operational flexibility, and enhanced defensive capabilities against evolving threats on the ground and in the air. While the C-17 offers short-field performance and the C-5 carries outsized payloads, the Air Force aims for a single, cost-effective solution. This modernization effort seeks to recapitalize aging fleets on the Air Force's own timeline, ensuring future strategic airlift needs are met.</p>

The European Medicines Agency, UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration all stated there is "no new evidence" to support such a link, affirming that paracetamol remains safe for pregnant women. Spain's Minister of Health criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, while a WHO spokesperson noted the evidence remains "inconsistent."

          <p>Legendary pop star Lulu has publicly revealed her long-hidden struggle with alcoholism in her new memoir, "If You Only Knew," describing the experience as "liberating." Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading her to rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu, who maintained a "highly functioning alcoholic" facade, even during her time on "Strictly Come Dancing," explains she kept her problem secret to protect her "squeaky clean" image. Her decision to share her story aims to break the generational pattern of alcoholism within her family, inspired by her father's own struggles.</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old academy graduate, has seized a first-team lifeline at Chelsea with a standout performance as a lone striker, a position of need for coach Enzo Maresca. George, who was nearly sold in the summer, scored a crucial half-volley and assisted the winning goal in a Carabao Cup comeback against Lincoln City. His vital contribution comes after back-to-back defeats for Chelsea, with Maresca admitting he had to motivate his players at halftime. George's dedication, including extensive extra training since childhood, is disrupting the typical Chelsea academy pathway of loans and sales, positioning him for a significant future role.</p>
