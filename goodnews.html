          <p>Chinese state television has aired a documentary detailing the development of the J-10 fighter jet, coinciding with claims from Pakistan that its J-10C variant shot down Indian warplanes during a recent conflict. Pakistan's foreign minister stated that J-10C jets downed several Indian planes, including French Rafale fighter jets. While India did not confirm these reports, a French official acknowledged losing a Rafale in the conflict. CCTV has also reported that the J-10CE, the export version of the J-10C, achieved its first combat success by shooting down foreign jets without any losses.</p>

          <p>The tradition of Indianapolis 500 winners drinking milk began in 1936 with Louis Meyer, who drank buttermilk after his victory. A cameraman captured the moment, and a dairy executive requested that milk be given to every winner. From 1947 to 1954, winners were handed cold water, but the milk tradition returned in 1956. Since then, winners have been offered a cash prize for drinking milk in the victory circle, continuing a long-standing and iconic tradition.</p>

          <p>A High Court injunction has temporarily halted the UK government from finalizing talks on the Chagos Islands deal. Two Chagossian women brought the case against the Foreign Office, leading to the injunction granted by Mr. Justice Goose. The agreement would transfer the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while allowing the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years. The legal action was brought due to concerns that the Chagossian people were not formally consulted about the deal.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin hit a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, growing optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and continued interest from institutional buyers. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially indicating investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a bitcoin skeptic, announced that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>
