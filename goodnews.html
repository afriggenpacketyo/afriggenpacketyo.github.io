          <p>Inspector Terrell Anderson of the New York Police Department was transferred after it was discovered that he had overridden negative psychological reports for 80 police candidates, allowing them to enter the Police Academy despite failing to meet mental health standards. The department is investigating the matter amid a recruiting crisis that has led to scaled-back educational requirements. Anderson, who has a history of community-oriented policing, is known for his efforts to recruit more officers of color. The psychological exam includes a written test and an interview, assessing candidates for personality disorders and traits incompatible with police work. </p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has granted expedited refugee status to some Afrikaners citing violence and discrimination, other Afrikaners dispute claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp argues that Whites remain economically strong, while cattle farmer Nick Serfontein asserts that racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate. Serfontein emphasizes the importance of land being shared by both Black and White South Africans, highlighting a project he launched to train new Black farmers. The article presents differing perspectives within the Afrikaner community regarding their safety and economic status in South Africa. </p>

The proposed legislation would hold individuals or companies liable for creating unauthorized digital replicas of performers, while also considering First Amendment protections.

          <p>US researchers propose a novel malaria treatment strategy: administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to clear their infection and prevent disease transmission. Current efforts focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, but the team at Harvard University has identified drugs that can rid mosquitoes of malaria parasites when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with a drug cocktail that can successfully cure mosquitoes of malaria, as the insects have become resistant to insecticides in many countries. This approach aims to directly target the parasites within mosquitoes, offering a new way to combat the disease. </p>
