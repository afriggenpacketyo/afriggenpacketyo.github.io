          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that Russia has been using Brazil as a launchpad for its elite intelligence officers, known as "illegals," for years. These spies create elaborate cover identities, start businesses, and even have love affairs to build credible backstories before heading to the United States, Europe, or the Middle East. Brazilian counterintelligence agents have been working to dismantle this network for the past three years in an operation known as Operation East, with intelligence support from the United States, Israel, and other Western allies. The investigation has uncovered at least nine Russian officers operating under Brazilian cover identities, disrupting Moscow's espionage efforts and leading to arrests and hasty retreats.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record, fueled by favorable macroeconomic conditions, including softer U.S. inflation numbers and de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war.

On-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market.

          <p>Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia has passed away at the age of 75 after a battle with esophageal cancer. Connolly, who served as the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stepped down from that role due to his returning cancer. He was known for his fierce advocacy on behalf of federal employees in his district and cultivated friendships on both sides of the aisle during his 15 years in Congress.

The series explores the Culture's interactions with less progressive civilizations, addressing issues like intervention, slavery, and social justice.

While the circuit remains a unique challenge for drivers, its stagnant nature has led to debates about its appeal. The upcoming race will be the 82nd staging of the Monaco Grand Prix.</p>
