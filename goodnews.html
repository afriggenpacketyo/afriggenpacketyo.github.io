          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified its previous order concerning Delhi's estimated one million stray dogs, now stipulating that non-aggressive, non-infected canines should be released after being vaccinated and sterilized. This revision came after significant protests and legal challenges from animal welfare groups, who advocated for more humane solutions than mass sheltering. The court, however, affirmed that dogs exhibiting rabies or aggressive behavior must be immunized and confined to shelters. Furthermore, the ruling prohibits feeding stray dogs in public areas, directing that dedicated spaces be established for this activity, and announced plans to formulate a national policy on stray dogs after hearing similar cases across states.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian newspaper, which had published allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment found the meaning of each of the newspaper's articles to be "substantially true," and Mrs. Justice Steyn explicitly stated that she found Clarke "not a credible or reliable witness." The Guardian's editor welcomed the decision, describing it as "a deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a landmark for investigative journalism, encouraging other women in similar situations to speak out.</p>

          <p>As measles cases rise across the U.S., the recently concluded Texas outbreak offers crucial lessons for public health officials facing similar challenges. Experts emphasize the need for more detailed county-level vaccination data and accessible, community-led vaccination campaigns, particularly in undervaccinated communities where anti-vaccine beliefs are becoming more prominent. During the Texas outbreak, officials navigated obstacles, including a CDC gag order, but successfully contained the spread by studying past outbreaks and implementing mass vaccination clinics. The article highlights the importance of tailored health education, considering free treatment centers, and utilizing community health workers to effectively address vaccine hesitancy and mount rapid responses to future outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Washington state celebrated the grand opening of its first In-N-Out Burger in Ridgefield, drawing hundreds of eager customers who lined up overnight and waited for hours. The popular California-based chain, founded in 1948, opened two hours early to accommodate the massive demand, with one dedicated fan driving two hours to be the first in line. The new location, managed by a 26-year veteran of In-N-Out, features a drive-through, indoor seating for 73 guests, and a covered patio. This expansion comes after CEO Lynsi Snyder's controversial comments about leaving California, which sparked debate but were clarified as part of the company's ongoing eastward growth strategy across multiple states.</p>

          <h2>Modern Understanding of the Plague Following Recent California Case</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent case of the plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident has prompted experts to clarify its modern-day risks and persistence. While commonly associated with the devastating Black Death of the 14th century, the disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, is now rare but treatable with antibiotics if caught early. Primarily affecting small animals and rodents in the U.S., human contraction usually occurs via infected flea bites or contact with infected rodents, particularly in rural areas like national forests. Despite significant medical advancements, eradication remains challenging as the bacterium persists in mammalian populations. Experts emphasize that with timely treatment, the plague is largely under control and not considered a top public health priority.</p>

          <p>R.F. Kuang's new dark academia thriller, "Katabasis," offers a unique and textured journey into hell, despite the common literary theme of underworld voyages. The article reviews how protagonist Alice Law and her partner embark on this descent to retrieve a mentor's soul, driven by academic ambition and a desire for teaching positions rather than traditional motives like love or knowledge. Kuang's deep knowledge of linguistics and chthonic myths enriches the narrative, which also critiques the dark inequities within fictional Oxbridge departments. The novel is described as more mature and less showy than her earlier works, maintaining a wry humor while exploring the self-destructive nature of academic pursuits.</p>

When the corn mysteriously begins to shrivel, protagonist Maizy embarks on an unconventional journey to find an outside expert, encountering a deceptive foot doctor in Tampa. Director Jack O'Brien's precise and invigorating staging, a sunshiny score by Brandy Clark and Shane McAnally, and strong vocal performances from the cast contribute to the show's acclaimed success, making it a delightful and entertaining theatrical experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Baron's deeply researched book, "The Martians," explores the early 20th-century fascination with intelligent life on Mars, a period when "we, the people of Earth, fell hard for another planet." The article highlights figures like Percival Lowell, Camille Flammarion, and Giovanni Schiaparelli, whose observations of "canali" (channels, misinterpreted as canals) fueled public imagination. Baron connects this "Mars craze" to the era's theory of evolution, tabloid journalism, and early science fiction by H.G. Wells. The review praises Baron's clarity and narrative drive, examining why people choose to believe, even when scientific method falters, and the lasting impact of this imaginative pursuit on space exploration.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's efforts to dismantle electric vehicle incentives and promote fossil fuels, the article argues that America's shift towards affordable EVs is inevitable, driven by global market forces. Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" is set to expire federal EV tax credits, yet Ford recently announced a significant $5 billion investment in a new EV platform to produce a $30,000 pickup truck by 2027. This ambitious and risky move challenges the current trend of expensive EVs and targets an underserved market segment. While U.S. EV sales have experienced a slowdown, global markets, particularly China and Europe, continue to accelerate the transition, compelling automakers like Ford to remain competitive with cheaper, cleaner vehicles.

          <p>China's electricity consumption surged to a record high in July, surpassing the 1 trillion kilowatt-hour mark, a level equivalent to the annual usage of all Asean nations combined. The article attributes this significant 8.6% year-on-year increase primarily to scorching heatwaves experienced across the country, which drove up demand. Electricity use in the primary industry, encompassing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, recorded the fastest growth at 20.2%. This substantial surge in power demand occurred even as overall industrial output growth slowed compared to the previous month, underscoring the profound impact of environmental factors on the nation's energy needs.</p>

          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted of a royal defamation (lese majeste) charge, which could have resulted in a 15-year prison sentence. The Bangkok Criminal Court found the witnesses and evidence too weak for conviction, noting the prosecution's account of his remarks was incomplete and potentially influenced by political bias against Thaksin. This acquittal marks a significant legal victory for the 76-year-old, who returned from exile in 2023 and has maintained a high public profile despite facing other corruption and abuse of power charges. The case highlights the controversial nature of Thailand's lese majeste law and the ongoing political tensions within the country's establishment.</p>
