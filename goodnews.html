          <p>The Trump administration brokered a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda to end the conflict in eastern DRC, driven by mineral wealth. The agreement, initialed in Washington, aims to end fighting and potentially bring billions in American investment to the region rich in minerals like coltan and cobalt. Critics are skeptical, as the M23 rebel group, believed to be backed by Rwanda, was not a signatory. The deal's success hinges on M23's adherence to its terms, amidst concerns about Rwanda's increasing mineral exports since M23's territorial gains.

          <p>Wales will ban the supply of plastic wet wipes to consumers starting in December 2026, aiming to reduce environmental harm from plastic and microplastic pollution. The ban, passed by the Senedd, includes an exemption for medical-grade wipes and does not extend to business-to-business transactions. This move makes Wales the first UK nation to implement such a ban. The 18-month transition period allows manufacturers time to adapt, with hopes for innovation in reusable and non-plastic alternatives. The optimism score is not applicable for this article.</p>

          <p>In an era marked by high polarization and easy offense, learning not to take offense can improve one's quality of life. Psychologist Wolfgang Zander's research suggests that offense-taking occurs in three stages: identification, assessment, and response. Understanding the neurological and psychological mechanisms behind taking offense can help control responses. Strategies for reducing offense-taking include laughing it off, activating the prefrontal cortex, and tuning out offense-making machines. The optimism score is not applicable for this article.</p>
