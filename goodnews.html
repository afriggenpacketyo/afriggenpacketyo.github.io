        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, with its value surging 44% in its best month since November. The rally is attributed to its recent inclusion in the benchmark index, positive regulatory developments like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, and new product launches. Analysts suggest the stock may have further room to grow, citing the market's underestimation of its lucrative revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring company, Circle. Despite concerns about declining trading volumes, the overall sentiment is optimistic as institutional investors increasingly view crypto as an evolving utility. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision has significantly curtailed the use of universal injunctions, which are court orders from a single judge that can block a government policy nationwide. These injunctions had been frequently used to halt Trump administration executive orders. The ruling states that such broad orders likely exceed the authority Congress has granted to federal courts. Legal experts predict this will fundamentally change how legal challenges against the executive branch are pursued, shifting the focus from seeking universal injunctions to other strategies like certifying large class-action lawsuits to achieve widespread relief against a federal policy.</p>

          <p>Honduran experimental pop artist Isabella Lovestory is releasing her second album, "Vanity," a record she describes as a "poisonous lollipop" that blends reggaeton with electroclash. In a recent interview, she discussed the album's themes, which explore the dark, cyclical nature of beauty and self-image, inspired by folklore vampires who cannot see their own reflection. As a self-sustaining artist who handles everything from her music videos to album art, she infuses her work with a DIY punk ethos. She views her persona as a complex, performance-art-like projection of her inner world, aiming to create immersive, dream-like experiences for her listeners.</p>

          <h2>Economic Analysis: Why Recent US Tariffs Have Not Led to Major Price Increases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 15:13:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns that new tariffs would fuel inflation, U.S. consumer prices have remained relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to build inventory before the tariffs took effect, a practice known as "front-loading." Additionally, some businesses are temporarily absorbing the higher costs to avoid losing customers, while others are using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay duty payments. However, experts caution that this situation is likely temporary, and consumers may begin to see higher prices in the latter half of the year if the tariffs remain in place.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to tap into their record-high equity, choosing between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents a key decision this summer. Currently, interest rates for both products are nearly identical, but that could change. A HELOC's variable rate could become cheaper if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates as some predict, positioning borrowers to benefit from lower payments. Conversely, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers stability, locking in a predictable rate now and protecting against potential market volatility, making the choice dependent on a homeowner's risk tolerance and economic outlook.

          <p>The Formula 1 driver market is buzzing with speculation about a potential move for four-time champion Max Verstappen from Red Bull to Mercedes for the next season. The rumors were fueled by comments from current Mercedes driver George Russell, who is also out of contract and acknowledged that talks with drivers like Verstappen are ongoing. While a Red Bull spokesperson insists Verstappen's contract runs to 2028, factors like Red Bull's recent performance dip and Mercedes' perceived strength with upcoming 2026 engine regulations make a switch plausible. The situation creates uncertainty for Russell and the future driver lineup at both top teams.</p>

The Lions are heavily favored to win, as the Force finished last among Australian Super Rugby teams and will be missing several key players who are in the national team camp.

A female Western Lowland gorilla named Binti Jua stunned onlookers by gently picking up the unconscious child, cradling him, and carrying him to a service door for zookeepers to retrieve him. The incident garnered international acclaim and highlighted a moment of profound interspecies compassion, often attributed to the gorilla's maternal instincts. Binti Jua, whose name means "daughter of sunshine," became a global hero and still resides at the zoo today, having recently celebrated her 37th birthday.</p>
