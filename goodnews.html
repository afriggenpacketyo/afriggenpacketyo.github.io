          <p>Vietti Food Group has initiated a voluntary recall of its 15 oz. cans of Yellowstone Brown Sugar Molasses Baked Beans due to the presence of undeclared soy, posing a risk to individuals with soy allergies. The recalled products were distributed across 23 states, identified by the Lot Code: Best if Used by Feb 17, 2028 printed on the bottom of the can. While no illnesses or adverse reactions have been reported to date, the FDA advises consumers with soy allergies to return the recalled beans to the store for a full refund.
