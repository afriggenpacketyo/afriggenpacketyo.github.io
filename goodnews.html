          <h2>India Shows Resilience Against England on Day Four of Fourth Test</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 13:56:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India mounted a determined resistance against England on the fourth day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, ending the day at 165-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After losing two early wickets for no score, an unbroken partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and captain Shubman Gill (78 not out) frustrated the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team post a massive total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's strong rearguard action has kept their hopes of securing a draw alive.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist visiting a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, was impressed by the vast selection of traditional and healthy Japanese foods compared to U.S. stores. The article highlights six categories of 'longevity foods' that were particularly notable, including a wide variety of seaweeds like mozuku and nori, which are rich in minerals and fiber. The store also offered an extensive range of soy-based products, seasonal Japanese produce such as enoki mushrooms and mizuna, and convenient, healthy ready-to-eat meals. The nutritionist noted the abundance of traditional rice crackers and the extensive selection of green tea, a beverage linked to better heart health and a longer life.</p>

          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Bid to Oust China-Friendly Opposition Lawmakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 12:38:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political development, Taiwanese voters have rejected a recall effort against 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. Despite the DPP winning the presidency, the KMT and its allies hold a majority in the legislature, enabling them to block key government initiatives. Supporters of the recall had criticized the opposition for passing controversial reforms and obstructing the defense budget amid rising threats from China. The KMT framed the result as a public choice for stability over political infighting.</p>

          <h2>Voters in Taiwan Reject Recall of Opposition KMT Lawmakers</h2>

          <p>An attempt to unseat 24 lawmakers from Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party has failed after voters rejected the recall measure in a significant referendum. This outcome is a blow to President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which lost its parliamentary majority in the 2024 elections and had hoped to regain control. The recall was initiated by civic groups following massive protests against controversial parliamentary reforms pushed by the KMT and its allies, which critics argued favored China and undermined democracy. The KMT, which advocates for closer ties with Beijing, celebrated the result as a vote for stability and a rejection of political infighting.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogacar is set to win his fourth Tour de France after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his substantial overall lead. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured a solo victory on the hilly 184.2km stage to Pontarlier, his first-ever stage win in the prestigious race. Pogacar finished with the main peloton, meaning he will almost certainly be crowned champion during the final processional stage into Paris. Groves' win was a significant achievement, completing his collection of stage victories across all three of cycling's Grand Tours. Barring any accidents on the final day, Pogacar's dominant performance throughout the race will earn him another coveted title.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, buoyed by positive developments in international trade and strong corporate earnings reports. The market rally was partly fueled by President Trump's announcement of a major trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China and the European Union. In economic news, housing data presented a mixed picture, with prices for existing homes rising while new home prices fell. A third of S&P 500 companies have reported second-quarter earnings, with 80% beating expectations. Notable performances came from companies like GE Vernova, which saw its stock soar after a blowout quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris set his fastest time on his first lap in the final session, while Piastri made a crucial mistake on his second attempt that cost him the top spot. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, just ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen, who was disappointed with his car's balance and a costly wheelspin moment on his final lap. With rain expected for Sunday's race, Norris hopes to leverage his front-row start to navigate what could be a chaotic and unpredictable Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>The New York-based chain 7th Street Burger is gaining recognition as a formidable competitor to Five Guys, offering high-quality smash burgers at a more affordable price point. Founded with a mission to emulate the success of In-N-Out on the East Coast, the chain emphasizes efficiency and a simplified menu. A cheeseburger at 7th Street Burger costs $6.50, significantly less than the $9.89 for a similar item at Five Guys, despite both chains using fresh, never-frozen beef. By focusing on only three menu items and optimizing its operations, 7th Street Burger provides a compelling value proposition. While its footprint is currently small, its model presents a strong challenge to more established fast-food giants.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, is recovering after a life-saving double-lung transplant, a procedure he underwent after a terminal disease was discovered by chance. Kennedy had no symptoms when a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring in his lungs, leading to a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal condition. As his lung function deteriorated, he was placed on the transplant list at the Cleveland Clinic. After a month in the hospital and two false alarms, he successfully received a new pair of lungs. Now recovering, his lung capacity is at 98%, and he is looking forward to training a new therapy dog, named Encore, to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump is reportedly interested in visiting China this autumn, with officials from both nations working to arrange a trip in October or November. According to sources familiar with the discussions, a potential September visit for a World War II commemoration is no longer being considered. Instead, the visit may occur before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. Recent high-level talks between the two countries' top diplomats have been described as positive, suggesting a shared consensus on arranging a leader-level summit. The potential meeting underscores ongoing efforts to manage the complex relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <h2>Justin Bieber's New Album Delivers a Melancholy, On-Trend 'Song of the Summer'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," has produced an unlikely song of the summer with its No. 2 hit, "Daisies." This analysis piece argues that the album's success stems from its departure from upbeat pop, instead offering a soothing, melancholic sound that resonates with the current cultural mood. The production is described as aqueous and gentle, influenced by indie artists Dijon and Mk.gee. The album's downtempo yet intricate songs, like "Daisies" and "All I Can Take," reflect a broader trend in popular music toward more reserved and simmering tracks. This contrasts with last year's hedonistic "Brat summer," suggesting a collective cultural hangover or malaise reflected in our listening habits.</p>
