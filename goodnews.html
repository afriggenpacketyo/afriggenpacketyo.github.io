          <p>Oracle's recent earnings report, driven by surging demand for its cloud services, has significantly propelled AI-related stocks to record highs. Shares of Oracle jumped 39%, nearing a $1 trillion market capitalization, with gas turbine maker GE Vernova and electrical component supplier Eaton also seeing substantial gains. CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted the cooler-than-expected August producer price index as a factor sparking speculation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, creating a favorable market backdrop. He also endorsed Apple and Danaher, emphasizing long-term investing and aggressive buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Universities of Kent and Greenwich are set to merge by autumn 2026, creating the UK's first "super-university" under the name London and South East University Group. This move, welcomed by the Office for Students, aims to provide a stronger financial foundation as 40% of English universities face deficits. While officials insist it's not a takeover, the University and College Union expressed concerns about potential redundancies, calling it a "takeover by Greenwich" due to Kent's financial struggles. The new institution will serve almost 50,000 students across existing campuses, with degrees still awarded under individual university names.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by 40% following its report of extraordinary cloud demand, marking its best day since 1992 and pushing its market capitalization towards $1 trillion. The company disclosed $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a 359% increase year-over-year, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This boom is attributed to Oracle's cloud infrastructure business and access to Nvidia's GPUs, capitalizing on the artificial intelligence surge despite fierce competition. Analysts described the results as "astounding" and a "momentous confirmation" of the AI trade, upgrading their ratings and price targets for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

The structural walls were 3D printed in a remarkable 18 hours of active time, demonstrating significant advancements in construction technology. This method offers 22% cost savings on structural walls, three times the strength of brick, and enhanced durability against fire, water, and termites. The breakthrough highlights a potential future for housing in the U.S., addressing rising costs, labor shortages, and sustainability concerns by scaling beyond single-story designs.</p>

Scharf distinguished between the President's vocal opinions and actual interference with the Fed's autonomy, noting the central bank's leaders serve distinct terms. Trump has consistently called for lower interest rates and previously attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Markets anticipate a Fed rate cut at its upcoming September meeting, influenced by lighter-than-expected inflation data and signs of a weakening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stocks closed mixed as investors reacted to U.S. inflation data, corporate earnings, and trade news. The softer-than-expected inflation print in the U.S. bolstered expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this month, potentially a larger half-percentage point reduction. Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk rose after announcing job cuts, while Zara owner Inditex gained significantly on strong Autumn/Winter collection sales. European markets also monitored reports of President Trump's request for the EU to impose high tariffs on China and India over Russian oil, risking further global trade destabilization.

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has blocked President Donald Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, granting a preliminary injunction that cites the importance of Fed independence. The judge ruled that Trump's stated "for cause" reason—allegations of mortgage fraud predating Cook's tenure—did not meet the legal standard for removal, which is limited to behavior in office. Cook, the first Black female Fed governor, denies wrongdoing. This decision ensures Cook's participation in the upcoming Fed meeting where a rate cut is expected, and safeguards the central bank's autonomy against political interference, a key concern during Trump's presidency.</p>

While natural geological processes cannot be entirely ruled out, the findings meet NASA's criteria for "potential biosignatures," warranting further investigation.
