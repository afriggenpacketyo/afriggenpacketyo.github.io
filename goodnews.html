          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a Category 4 storm, is currently located in the Pacific Ocean and is moving westward toward Hawaii. As of Thursday morning, the storm's maximum sustained winds were topping 140 mph, with little change in strength forecast over the next day or so. The National Hurricane Center expects a turn toward the west-northwest on Friday, with a gradual increase in forward speed as Kiko approaches the Hawaiian Islands from the east. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect as of Thursday, but tropical-storm-force winds could start affecting Hawaii on Sunday. The article reports on the hurricane's projected path and potential impact on Hawaii.</p>

          <p>With elevated interest rates on personal loans and credit cards, homeowners can leverage their home equity through HELOCs and home equity loans for more affordable borrowing. As of September 4, 2025, average home equity loan rates range from 8.22% to 8.37%, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%. HELOCs offer variable interest rates and a revolving line of credit, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with fixed interest rates. These options also offer potential tax benefits for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations, but homeowners should carefully consider their budget and financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As of September 3, 2025, the price of gold is $3,559.95 per ounce, reflecting its status as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge. Gold prices fluctuate based on supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. During economic uncertainty, investors often turn to gold, driving up its price, while strong economic conditions can lead to lower prices. Investors should monitor these factors to make informed decisions about buying gold. (not investment advice)</p>

This collaboration follows President Trump's executive order aimed at allowing investors greater access to alternative assets in 401(k) plans. The deal is intended to boost T.

          <p>The peace sign, once a symbol of opposition to the Vietnam War, has become a ubiquitous photo pose among Gen Z and Gen Alpha. The gesture's popularity may be linked to the influence of Japanese pop culture, especially anime, where it is often used in both celebratory and peaceful contexts. Kids do the peace sign in photos because, more so than in generations past, they need something to do in photos. It has also become a gesture linked with cuteness and is simply a way to give them something to do with their hands. Optimism score is not applicable to this article.</p>
