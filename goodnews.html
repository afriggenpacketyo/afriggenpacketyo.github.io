          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as a reinforcement of Canadian sovereignty in light of past suggestions by U.S. President Trump about annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda, emphasizing Canada's distinct national identity and constitutional monarchy. The visit, while Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, is intended to highlight the differences between Canada and the United States, with the King's presence underscoring Canada's unique history and symbolism. The King's speech, written by the Canadian government, will be delivered on Tuesday following ceremonial events.</p>

          <p>Financial experts weigh in on annuity types for seniors, citing market volatility and increasing lifespans as factors driving interest in guaranteed income streams. Immediate annuities provide a lifetime income stream, while fixed indexed annuities offer growth potential with principal protection. Deferred income annuities start payments at a future date, and variable annuities offer market exposure with potential for higher returns but also greater risk. Consulting a financial advisor is crucial to understand the tradeoffs, liquidity restrictions, and how each annuity type fits into a broader financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Driven by soaring electricity demand from artificial intelligence, Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are investing in nuclear fission startups. These companies are seeking stable and predictable power sources for their data centers, with new small modular reactor (SMR) designs promising to overcome the limitations of older nuclear plants. SMRs rely on mass manufacturing to reduce costs, and tech companies are either signing agreements to buy power from these startups or investing in them directly, such as Google's commitment to purchase power from Kairos Power.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated revised sales of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to lower soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The move follows criticism of the government's handling of rising rice prices amid broader inflation concerns, with the new farm minister pledging to address the issue. The plan involves releasing rice produced in 2021 and 2022 directly to major retailers, bypassing the auction system. A special response team has been established to manage the issue, with large retailers and online platforms considering participation in the program.</p>

          <p>Sexual orientation develops during puberty through a complex interplay of biological and psychosocial factors, and it is not a choice. While there is no single cause, research suggests genetic, hormonal, and social influences contribute to its development. Studies indicate that male pheromones stimulate hypothalamic activity in both heterosexual women and homosexual men, but not in heterosexual men. Although social factors and experiences can influence how individuals express their sexuality, conversion therapies have proven unsuccessful in changing sexual orientation. This information is vital to understand sexual diversity and challenge societal prejudices.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing policy of allowing two free checked bags, a move that will take effect soon and marks a significant change for the airline. This decision comes as baggage fees have become a substantial revenue source for U.S. airlines, and Southwest has been under pressure to increase revenue. In addition to the new baggage fees, Southwest is also implementing other changes, such as getting rid of open seating and introducing basic-economy tickets.</p>

          <p>Anthropologist Sabine Hyland is studying ancient khipus from the remote village of Jucul in the Peruvian Andes to unlock the lost writing system of the Inca Empire. Khipus, knotted cords used by the Incas to record information, offer a potential window into the history and culture of this civilization. The research involves linguistic analysis, statistical methods, and collaboration among scholars to decipher the complex code embedded in the cords. Deciphering khipus could provide insights into the origins of writing and the rise and fall of the Inca Empire.</p>
