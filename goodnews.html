          <p>President Trump is downplaying concerns that some of his MAGA supporters are uneasy about a possible military strike on Iran, amid ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. Trump asserted his supporters are more supportive than ever, emphasizing his "America First" agenda. However, some prominent MAGA figures, like Tucker Carlson and Marjorie Taylor Greene, have cautioned against U.S. involvement, while others, including Vice President JD Vance, defend Trump's approach, emphasizing his focus on American goals and preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The Republican Party is divided on military engagements, reflecting Trump's shift in GOP direction, with some strategists warning about potential ramifications for the MAGA coalition. Optimism around the situation is tentative, with uncertainty looming over future military action.</p>

          <p>The American political system, particularly within the Democratic Party, often struggles with the issue of elderly incumbents remaining in office despite declining capabilities. The recent discussion surrounding Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting congressional delegate for Washington, D.C., highlights this challenge. The article points to the broader issue of gerontocracy in American politics, citing examples like Strom Thurmond and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose decisions to remain in power despite age and health concerns had significant consequences. The author suggests that the U.S. could benefit from an institution similar to the British House of Lords, providing an emeritus track for politicians who are no longer vigorous enough for frontline politics but still wish to contribute their expertise.</p>

          <p>The company developing China's first home-grown widebody passenger jet, the C929, is targeting a maiden commercial flight by 2035. This timeline, shared with foreign partners at the Paris Air Show, aligns with the "long-haul" approach taken by Boeing and Airbus during their initial widebody development, reflecting Comac's emphasis on safety and prudence. Comac anticipates the C929, resembling the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 series, to receive certification in China by 2032. The C929, capable of carrying up to 440 passengers with a maximum range of 12,000km, has entered the detailed design phase.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a peace agreement on June 27, brokered by the United States, with the aim of ending fighting in eastern Congo. The agreement includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, prohibiting hostilities, and disarming non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will witness the signing ceremony, which builds on a declaration of principles signed in April. The agreement is intended to halt the conflict in eastern Congo and attract Western investment to the region, though the commitment of the Congo River Alliance remains uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Japan PM Faces Dilemma on Trump Tariffs Ahead of Elections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 04:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is navigating a difficult situation regarding U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump, as he aims to prioritize Japan's interests ahead of an upcoming national election. Ishiba's government is seeking to avoid concessions that would harm the Japanese economy, particularly the auto sector, while also attempting to maintain its role as a defender of free trade. The lack of a tariff deal with the U.S. could have economic repercussions for Japan, but making easy concessions could also hurt voter support.</p>
