          <p>A coalition of allied nations has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future multinational force intended to stabilize Ukraine after a ceasefire. The decision was made during a meeting in Rome, which notably included a U.S. delegation for the first time, featuring special envoy Keith Kellogg and Senators Graham and Blumenthal. This "reassurance force" aims to provide logistical support, training, and security for Ukraine's skies and the Black Sea to deter future Russian aggression. While no U.S. ground troops are planned, the American presence was hailed as a fundamental sign of Western unity.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been honored for their exceptional bravery in confronting the individual responsible for the fatal knife attack in Southport last year. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive at the chaotic scene where three children were murdered and many others injured. The officers entered the building and, armed with a baton and Taser, successfully disarmed and arrested the attacker, who was holding a large knife. They were recognized at the Police Federation's annual bravery awards for their decisive and courageous actions under extreme pressure.</p>

          <p>Despite a slump in sales across much of Europe and backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, Tesla is experiencing remarkable success in Norway. The U.S. automaker saw a 54% year-on-year increase in new car sales in June, largely driven by the popularity of its revamped Model Y SUV. Analysts attribute this to the vehicle's competitive pricing and features that appeal to Norwegian consumers, such as large luggage space and all-wheel drive. While a recent survey indicates some Norwegians are hesitant to buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's market dominance in the country remains strong.</p>

While neither player had a standout shooting performance, they both showcased their skills and intensity, with James hitting a key three-pointer over Flagg. James ultimately missed a potential game-winning shot at the buzzer, but he expressed satisfaction with his defensive effort and improving conditioning.</p>

He states that founders must consciously manage the intense pressures to avoid burnout and protect their mental and physical health.

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. The project aims to restore the natural habitat for numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been threatened by decades of waterway obstruction. The dense network of dams had severely restricted water flow, reduced spawning grounds, and blocked critical migration routes for fish. This large-scale restoration is intended to save what ecologists consider the last major refuge for these unique species in the upper Yangtze region.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are rapidly gaining market share and reducing the country's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and a fast-expanding charging network, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged 175% in the first half of the year. This trend, primarily for short-haul routes in industrial areas, is causing analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts and accelerate predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak. The shift is further supported by the lower long-term operating costs of electric trucks compared to their diesel counterparts.</p>

Curators described the find as incredibly unlikely, likening it to a "hole in one from the moon." The vertebra is believed to belong to a small, plant-eating dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period, approximately 67.5 million years ago.
