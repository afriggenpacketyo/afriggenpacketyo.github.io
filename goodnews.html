          <p>Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, has successfully dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project. This action follows the discovery of over 394,000 Windows computers infected with the Lumma malware between March 16 and May 16. The malware was used by hackers to steal sensitive information like passwords, credit card details, bank account information, and cryptocurrency wallets. Microsoft obtained a court order to seize web domains and redirect them to Microsoft sinkholes, disrupting communications between the malware and its victims and bolstering online security for users.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed a surprise bill that would eliminate taxes on tips, a move that could provide financial relief to millions of workers in tipped occupations. The bill, which received bipartisan support, allows workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from their income between 2025 and 2028, provided those tips are properly reported. While the policy could benefit moderate to middle-income workers, it also raises potential issues such as income misclassification and the introduction of tips in new occupations.

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota concluded with the decision to keep the "tush push" play, despite a proposal from the Green Bay Packers to ban it. The proposal failed to reach the required 75% majority, with a vote of 22-10. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have been highly successful with the play, voiced their support for it. The Packers cited player safety and pace of play as reasons for the ban, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the "tush push."</p>

Mason reflected on the challenges and magic of creating art, acknowledging the intimidation of working with paint and the possibility of ruining a piece with a single brushstroke.</p>

          <p>Former CIA chief of disguise Jonna Mendez shared insights on "CBS Mornings" about the reality behind the mask technology depicted in the "Mission: Impossible" films. Mendez confirmed that the CIA developed masks capable of quickly changing an agent's gender and ethnicity. She personally demonstrated this technology to President George H.W. Bush and other high-ranking officials, who were unable to recognize her until she removed the disguise. The masks were remarkably realistic, allowing agents to apply them in as little as 10 seconds, even without mirrors.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is directing Pfizer and Moderna to broaden warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines concerning the risk of heart side effects, particularly for young males. The updated warnings will apply to males aged 16 to 25 for both vaccines, citing a higher incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in this age group. The rate of these conditions was estimated at 38 cases per million doses in males aged 16 to 25. The FDA's decision was influenced by recent data from its safety surveillance system and a study on individuals who developed COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, reversing a recent policy change following mounting political pressure. Over 10 million pensioners lost entitlement to these payments when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. Starmer stated that the government would adjust the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again, though the specific details and timing of the changes remain unclear. The winter fuel payment provides a lump-sum to pensioners to assist with heating costs during the winter months.</p>
