          <p>Emma Raducanu advanced to the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, securing her return to the British number one ranking for the first time in two years after a decisive victory against Rebecca Sramkova. Raducanu's performance marked a significant comeback after a period of inconsistent form and injuries, surpassing Katie Boulter in the rankings. Other British players, Katie Boulter and Heather Watson, were eliminated in the last 16, leaving Raducanu as the sole Briton remaining in the tournament. Raducanu will face either Zheng Qinwen or McCartney Kessler in the next round, and displayed good sportsmanship by writing a supportive message to Boulter on the camera lens after her victory.</p>

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher, was released on bail after being charged with smuggling frog embryos into the US. Petrova had been in federal custody since February after being questioned at Boston Logan International Airport about the samples she obtained in France for research. She claimed she was unaware that the items needed to be declared and feared persecution if deported back to Russia for opposing the invasion of Ukraine. Her colleagues at Harvard have described her expertise as "irreplaceable," and a judge ruled that the immigration officers' actions were unlawful and that the embryos posed no threat. </p>

          <p>A recent study by LendingTree reveals significant variations in tipping rates across the United States, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most on average at 16.07%, while Utah residents tip the least at 4.09%. The study suggests that tipping rates are influenced by how often people dine out in each state, with higher rates in states where full-service restaurants are more prevalent. Washington, D.C., residents spend the most on dining out, averaging $10,291 per year, while Illinois has seen the largest increase in dining expenditures since 2000. The study also touches on the "No Tax on Tips" provision, which could offer relief to tipped workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate is considering potential changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" approved by the House, with senators discussing revisions to SNAP, SALT, border funding, Medicaid, and energy tax credits.

Rand Paul is advocating for reduced border security funding. Medicaid changes remain uncertain, and senators are also considering adjustments to the transferability of expiration dates for certain Inflation Reduction Act energy tax credits.

          <p>Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys' visionary, died at age 82, leaving behind a legacy of innovative and emotionally resonant music that captured the essence of California's youth culture. Wilson's genius lay in his ability to blend complex sound design with heartfelt emotions, creating art that was both oceanic and deeply personal. He pushed the boundaries of pop music with albums like "Pet Sounds," which is considered one of the greatest albums ever made, despite his struggles with mental health. Wilson's influence continues to inspire musicians to explore new sonic territories and appreciate the power of music to connect with others. </p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that innocent victims of wrong-house raids by federal law enforcement can seek compensation for emotional and physical harms, upholding an exception to legal immunity. The decision revives a lawsuit brought by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017, causing trauma and property damage. Justice Neil Gorsuch confirmed that Congress has opened the door to potential liability when an officer commits an "assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process". Civil rights advocates say there are likely hundreds of cases of wrong-house raids by U.S. law enforcement every year. </p>

          <p>George Russell stated that Max Verstappen took accountability for their collision at the Spanish Grand Prix, though he believed Verstappen was trying to run him off the road rather than intentionally crash into him. Russell noted that Verstappen is close to receiving a ban for accumulating penalty points on his license and that his rivals could benefit from his precarious position. He met Verstappen at Nice airport on Sunday, but said that he had forgotten about Barcelona as Verstappen was there with his newborn. Russell said Verstappen's rivals could benefit from his precarious position at this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix.</p>
