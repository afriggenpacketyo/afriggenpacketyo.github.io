          <h2>Audio Reveals Biden Joked About Being Young During Special Counsel Interview</h2>

          <p>Newly released audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about being a "young man" despite struggling with key memories. The interview, conducted in October 2023, focused on Biden's handling of classified documents, and the audio recordings highlight instances where Biden slurred his words and appeared to have memory lapses. Hur's report declined to press charges against Biden, characterizing him as a sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory, a conclusion that drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Ultimately, Biden dropped out of the presidential race in July, and his vice president Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in November's general election.</p>

          <p>Beth Potter, an Olympic triathlon bronze medalist, achieved second place in the World Triathlon Championship Series held in Yokohama, Japan, finishing just four seconds behind Luxembourg's Jeanne Lehair.

Although Lehair secured the victory, Potter recorded the fastest run leg in the race, marking a strong return to form after competing in the European Road Running Championships last month. Reigning Olympic and world champion Cassandre Beaugrand of France crashed out on lap six of the bike leg.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, located near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen, with police investigating the theft. Residents speculate the statue may have been vandalized or melted down for cash, rather than for political reasons. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze after an arson incident, had been criticized for not accurately resembling Ms. Trump. The American artist who commissioned the statue sees its disappearance as a silencing, while locals express little regret over its absence.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas from modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups in northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing how early settlers split into isolated groups, adapting to different environments. Researchers found that the closest living relatives of Indigenous North Americans are west Beringian groups, such as the Inuit, Koryaks, and Luoravetlans. The study also highlighted distinct genetic traits in various Indigenous groups, which may have evolved through adaptation to extreme environments.</p>
