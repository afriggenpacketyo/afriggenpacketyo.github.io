        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a significant legislative package, described by proponents as the "big, beautiful bill," which encompasses key elements of the Trump administration's agenda, including spending priorities and tax cuts. House Speaker Mike Johnson championed the bill, framing it as a fulfillment of promises to the American people and contrasting Republican "results" with Democratic "performances." The vote followed a record-breaking speech by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who spoke in opposition to the legislation. The bill is now expected to move forward, with the president reportedly ready to sign it into law.</p>

          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India has established a commanding position over England, largely due to a monumental innings from captain Shubman Gill, who scored 269 runs. His performance anchored India's first-innings total to a massive 587. In response, England's top-order batsmen struggled, collapsing to 77-3 by the close of day two, facing a significant deficit. With India's bowlers finding more movement than their English counterparts, England now faces a formidable challenge to avoid defeat and prevent India from leveling the series.</p>

He discusses the importance of a car suiting a driver's style, drawing parallels to his past struggles at Red Bull. Looking ahead, Albon remains realistic about Williams' journey, seeing 2028 as a potential timeframe for the team to consistently compete at the front of the grid.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to borrow $150,000 against their home equity face a choice between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar initial monthly payments. However, the key difference lies in the rate structure; a HELOC's rate can fluctuate with market conditions, potentially making payments cheaper or more expensive over time, while a home equity loan's rate remains constant. Borrowers should carefully consider their risk tolerance for changing payments when deciding which option is more suitable for their financial situation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card debt rising, many consumers are inadvertently making their financial situations worse through common mistakes. This article highlights five key errors, including making only minimum payments, which can prolong debt for decades and accrue thousands in extra interest. Other costly habits are ignoring the expiration of promotional 0% APR periods, using high-fee cash advances, and closing old credit cards, which can harm one's credit score. Falling even slightly behind on payments can trigger steep penalty rates, significantly increasing the overall cost of borrowing and making it harder to escape the debt cycle.

          <p>A recent survey in Germany indicates that a significant majority of the public supports tightening laws regarding alcohol consumption by teenagers. Nearly two-thirds of respondents believe that 14-year-olds should be prohibited from drinking alcohol, even when supervised by a legal guardian, which is currently permitted. Furthermore, just over half of those surveyed are in favor of raising the legal purchasing age for beer and wine from 16 to 18. These findings come amid ongoing calls from doctors' associations and politicians to address the health risks associated with early alcohol consumption among young people.</p>

A better-than-expected June jobs report indicated economic resilience, though it may temper arguments for immediate Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.
