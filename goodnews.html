          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from U.S. immigration detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. The judge stated that Khalil is not a flight risk and poses no danger to the community, criticizing the government's case for detention as highly unusual. Khalil's arrest was widely condemned as an attack on free speech, as he was detained without criminal charges. He was ordered to surrender his passport and green card and limit his travel to certain states as part of his conditional release.</p>

          <p>Jia Zhangke's latest drama, "Caught by the Tides," uses nearly 25 years of footage, including scenes from his acclaimed films, to present a poignant story about globalization and alienation in China. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) as she journeys through a rapidly changing China in search of Bin (Li Zhubin), highlighting the weight of time on individuals and nations. The film is divided into three chapters, each building emotionally from the last, and rewards viewers familiar with Jia's filmography with scenes and outtakes from his earlier movies. The film explores themes of romantic despair, desperation, and the impact of unchecked technological advancement on communities and dreams.</p>

          <p>Kroger has announced plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the U.S. over the next 18 months, representing approximately 5% of its Kroger-branded stores. The decision was revealed alongside the company's first-quarter earnings report, which indicated a slight drop in sales to $45.1 billion. Kroger anticipates that these closures will provide a modest financial benefit, with resulting savings being reinvested in customer experience initiatives. Employees at the affected stores will be offered roles at other Kroger locations.</p>

          <p>Tesla is expected to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with a limited number of Model Y vehicles debuting on June 22. Access to the rides is by invitation only, and initial trips will exclude airport routes and may be limited by bad weather. A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat during the trips, which are confined to a geofenced area of the city and monitored remotely. Despite past delays, analysts believe robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, though the company still lags behind competitors like Waymo in the autonomous vehicle market.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that his administration is close to a "deal" with Harvard University, potentially resolving their ongoing disputes, just as a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from restricting Harvard's ability to host foreign students. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, which tracks student visa applications. The Department of Homeland Security had previously accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the legal battle.</p>
