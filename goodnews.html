          <p>Gene Simmons, the vocalist and bassist for the rock band KISS, was involved in a car accident in Los Angeles after he reportedly passed out while driving. Simmons later assured fans he was "completely fine," attributing the incident to being a "horrible driver." His wife, Shannon, explained that he was likely dehydrated due to a new medication and his dislike of drinking water, which caused him to lose consciousness before his vehicle struck a parked car. No serious injuries were reported, and Simmons is recovering at home after a brief hospitalization.</p>

          <p>A New York City judge has dismissed a civil summons for disorderly conduct against Alex O’Keefe, a former writer for the show “The Bear.” The case stemmed from a September incident where O'Keefe, who is Black, was detained by MTA police on a train following a complaint from a white passenger about him occupying two seats. O’Keefe maintained he was harassed and “detained for sitting while Black,” while police alleged he was disruptive and delayed the train. The judge deemed the summons “facially insufficient,” effectively ending the case against him.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a brief standoff. His arrest concludes a months-long, multi-agency manhunt that began after the group broke out of the facility through a hole behind a toilet. Authorities tracked Groves to a home using a tip and took him into custody without incident. Groves has a history of violent crime, including a second-degree murder conviction, and his escape was attributed to staffing and design flaws at the jail.</p>

          <p>As the Palace Museum in Beijing celebrates its 100th anniversary, the history of its priceless collection reflects a period of national turmoil and resilience. During wartime from 1933 to 1950, thousands of artifacts were transported over 10,000 miles across China for safekeeping, a journey that underscores their cultural significance. This heritage remains physically divided, with major collections housed in museums in both Beijing and Taipei, a situation that continues to mirror cross-strait political tensions. The story highlights the enduring power of cultural preservation.</p>
