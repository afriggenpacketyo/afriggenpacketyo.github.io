          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a significant 27% increase in after-hours trading despite missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The surge was driven by the company's optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business, fueled by major new AI-related contracts, including one with OpenAI. Oracle's remaining performance obligation, a key metric for future revenue, has grown to $455 billion, signaling strong investor confidence in its ability to compete in the booming AI market. The company also announced ambitious long-term revenue goals for its cloud division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple has unveiled its new iPhone 17 lineup, featuring incremental upgrades to the base and Pro models and introducing a new, ultra-thin "iPhone Air" design. While the event did not provide major updates on the company's generative AI strategy, the refreshed hardware and strategic price increases are seen as sufficient to maintain consumer interest. The iPhone Air replaces the Plus model and includes a more powerful A19 Pro chip, positioning it between the base and Pro versions. Analysts suggest these updates buy Apple more time to perfect its "Apple Intelligence" offerings, which remain key to driving a major upgrade cycle.</p>

The new offering is a sandwich cookie inspired by rocky road ice cream, featuring flavors of chocolate, marshmallow, and toasted almond-flavored crème. This addition comes as the organization is retiring two other flavors, the S'mores and Toast-Yay! cookies, resulting in a smaller overall lineup for the upcoming season. The annual cookie sale is a key program for the youth organization, teaching members financial literacy and funding various philanthropic and educational activities.</p>

Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, she stated that the biggest threat to established businesses is not AI itself, but individuals and competitors who are deeply integrating AI into their operations to disrupt industries. Friar's comments come as OpenAI continues to invest heavily in its technology, addressing challenges like compute constraints by expanding its infrastructure partnerships beyond Microsoft to include companies like Oracle and Coreweave to meet soaring demand.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its restaurant remodeling plans, weeks after reversing a controversial logo change that sparked intense online backlash from conservatives. The company had introduced a minimalist logo and plans for more contemporary interiors to modernize its image, but was accused of going "woke." After reinstating its traditional "Old Timer" logo, the chain has now also shelved the interior redesigns, stating it heard customers' desire to preserve the brand's vintage Americana aesthetic. The company affirmed that the rocking chairs, fireplaces, and country store feel are here to stay.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was taken into custody following a dispute over a parking spot in his Los Angeles neighborhood. According to his agent, Cruz was washing his car when three women parked extremely close to him and began recording him after he asked them to move. The agent claims that while telling them to stop, Cruz inadvertently splashed the women with his hose. The women alleged he intentionally sprayed them and called the police, leading to his arrest, though his agent expects the case to be dropped.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Geographic Disparities in Tax Cuts from New Federal Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 16:07:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law signed by President Trump will provide an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, but the benefits will vary significantly by state. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to receive the largest average cuts, while those in states with lower average incomes, such as Mississippi and West Virginia, will see the smallest reductions. The geographic differences are driven by provisions that favor higher earners and business owners, as well as an increased deduction cap for state and local taxes that benefits residents of high-tax states.

          <p>Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian detailed how the company is successfully monetizing its artificial intelligence products through consumption-based pricing, subscriptions, and upselling strategies. Speaking at a technology conference, Kurian revealed that Google Cloud's customer demand backlog has reached $106 billion, growing faster than its revenue, with AI already generating billions for the company. He explained that customers pay for AI infrastructure by usage, subscribe to services like Gemini and Workspace, and are often upsold to higher-priced tiers as their needs grow, which in turn drives further revenue growth and customer acquisition.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new manager, just hours after the departure of Nuno Espírito Santo. Nuno's 21-month tenure ended following public criticism of the club's transfer strategy and a reported breakdown in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham in June, was brought in quickly to lead the club into its first European campaign in 30 years. The club's owner stated that the Australian manager has the credentials to help the team challenge for trophies, building on the progress made under his predecessor.</p>
