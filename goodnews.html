Authorities established a wide exclusion zone and prepared to defuse the munition on-site, a process that has become a regular occurrence in Germany. These discoveries are a lasting legacy of the Allied bombing campaigns during the war, frequently disrupting daily life as experts work to safely neutralize the decades-old ordnance.</p>

          <p>A new cultural trend of "AI veganism" is emerging, where individuals abstain from using artificial intelligence due to ethical, environmental, and personal wellness concerns. This commentary draws a parallel to dietary veganism, highlighting issues such as AI's significant energy consumption, its reliance on underpaid human labor for training, and its potential to diminish critical thinking skills. The author suggests that while complete avoidance may be difficult, being more mindful of AI's hidden costs is a valuable step.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced a new policy to waive tuition fees for the final year of public kindergarten, in its latest attempt to combat a plummeting national birth rate. The measure, which will also provide subsidies to reduce fees at private kindergartens, aims to ease the financial burden on families and encourage them to have more children.

          <p>In a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates, a California Court of Appeal has ruled that the University of California must reconsider its policy barring undocumented students from on-campus employment. The court found the university's justification—fear of federal reprisal—to be an improper basis for a policy that violates state anti-discrimination laws. While the ruling does not mandate that the UC system hire these students, it forces the institution to re-evaluate its stance based on proper legal grounds.</p>

          <p>HBO's "The Penguin," a spinoff from "The Batman," has earned 24 Emmy nominations by focusing on a deep, character-driven narrative rather than typical franchise spectacle.
