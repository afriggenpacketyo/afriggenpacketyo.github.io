          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily ruled that Lisa Cook can remain a Federal Reserve governor, rejecting President Donald Trump's immediate request for her removal. The court will hear arguments on her firing in January, maintaining a federal judge's stay on the action. Trump had cited claims of mortgage fraud, which Cook denies, asserting her removal is politically motivated due to her stance on the Fed's monetary policy and interest rates. This decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to continue voting on benchmark interest rate decisions, upholding the central bank's independence against presidential pressure for now.</p>

          <p>Jane Goodall, the renowned British primatologist, anthropologist, and conservationist, has died at the age of 91 from natural causes while on a U.S. speaking tour. Goodall's groundbreaking research on chimpanzees in Tanzania, beginning in 1960, revolutionized scientific understanding by demonstrating their tool-making abilities and complex social behaviors, challenging previous definitions of humanity. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, tirelessly advocating for wildlife protection, environmental causes, and inspiring countless women to pursue careers in STEM fields. Her legacy as a UN Messenger of Peace and a pioneer in ethology leaves an indelible mark on science and conservation.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, home equity loans are experiencing a slight reduction in cost, making a $70,000 loan approximately $677 to $862 per month depending on the repayment term. While current rates are marginally more affordable than earlier in the year, the article emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the timing and exploring alternatives like Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) or cash-out refinances. Borrowing from home equity carries inherent risks, including the potential loss of one's home if payments cannot be met as agreed. Therefore, a thorough financial assessment is crucial before committing to such a significant borrowing option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford Motor reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, each increasing by approximately 8% year-over-year, largely propelled by record electric vehicle (EV) sales. Consumers accelerated their EV purchases ahead of the expiration of $7,500 federal incentives, leading to a projected record 10% market share for EVs in Q3. While a temporary dip in EV sales is anticipated post-incentive, automakers like Hyundai are proactively reducing prices and offering cash incentives to sustain momentum. This strong performance signals a significant and evolving shift in the automotive market towards electrification, despite policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>
