          <p>Archaeologists have painstakingly pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing remarkable frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in Central London. Discovered in 2021, the frescoes depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The largest fresco measures about 5m by 3m and features a lower section imitating marble and yellow panels with green borders. The art suggests that the Roman painters incorporated local elements into classical designs, and the team hopes to find the missing fragment bearing the artist's name to further understand the history of Roman London.</p>

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made a successful return to the Dodgers' mound after recovering from Tommy John surgery, pitching four sharp innings in their 4-3 win against the San Diego Padres. Sheehan's performance, featuring a fastball around 95 mph and effective sliders and changeups, provided a much-needed boost to the Dodgers' rotation. Justin Wrobleski followed with five innings of relief, but struggled in the ninth, giving up two runs. Will Smith ultimately secured the victory with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth, marking a promising sign for the Dodgers' pitching depth in the second half of the season. The team is hopeful that Sheehan will become a solid option.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to avoid higher duties imposed by the U.S. government. This legal practice involves altering an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code with lower tariff rates. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements into products, using cotton instead of synthetic materials, and adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins. Columbia Sportswear and Converse have also implemented strategic product tweaks to save on tariff costs, demonstrating the widespread use of this practice. (not investment advice)</p>
