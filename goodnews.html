          <p>Manchester United's newly assembled £200 million frontline, featuring new signings like Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo, is experiencing "teething problems" in the Premier League. Despite significant investment, the team has scored only one goal from open play in four matches, raising concerns about their attacking cohesion and ability to convert chances. Manager Ruben Amorim remains optimistic, citing the creation of numerous opportunities, but the team's current 16th-place standing after two games underscores the urgent need for their expensive new players to gel and deliver tangible results. The article highlights the pressure on the team to perform and the challenges of integrating new talent.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has escalated to an estimated $750 million, securing its place as the game's tenth-largest grand prize, after no winning ticket emerged from Saturday's drawing. This substantial sum carries an estimated cash value of $338.6 million before taxes for a single winner. Although the grand prize has remained unclaimed since May 31, several players nationwide did secure other significant prizes. The next opportunity to win this massive payout is scheduled for Monday evening, as hopeful participants continue to test their luck against the daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer presents his market strategy following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signaling of impending rate cuts, which triggered a significant stock market rally. He attributes Powell's shift to a dramatic deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs, which he believes will have a muted inflationary impact. Cramer identifies housing, mergers and acquisitions, and IPOs as bullish sectors, while cautioning against enterprise software and certain healthcare and auto-related stocks. The article provides specific investment recommendations and insights into market dynamics ahead of a potentially volatile September, emphasizing the importance of adapting to changing economic signals.

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished figure in both Broadway and television, has passed away at the age of 96. Before gaining widespread recognition for his acting roles, including Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," Adler spent decades behind the scenes on 53 Broadway productions as a stage manager, producer, and director. He began his acting career in his 60s, a pivot that led to consistent work for over 30 years. Adler, who authored a memoir last year, believed retirement was "a road to nowhere" and continued to embrace new opportunities in entertainment.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has launched its 10th test flight of the massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket from the Texas Gulf Coast, aiming to rigorously test numerous upgrades after three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures. The flight plan includes a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf of Mexico, with an intentionally disabled engine to gather data on backup system capabilities. The Starship upper stage will attempt a suborbital flight, deploying simulated satellites and undergoing stress tests during reentry, including the removal of heat shield tiles from vulnerable areas. This test is crucial for SpaceX's goals of Mars colonization and NASA's Artemis moon landing program, which heavily relies on Starship for astronaut transport and in-space refueling.</p>
