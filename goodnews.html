          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson discussed the recently passed "big, beautiful bill" on "Face the Nation," highlighting its tax cuts, border security measures, and investments in American energy. He estimated the bill's cost between $4 trillion and $5 trillion over the next decade but emphasized over $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people. Johnson defended the bill against criticism from Senate Republicans and economists, arguing it will stimulate economic growth by reducing taxes and regulations. He addressed concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food stamps, stating the focus is on eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse rather than cutting benefits for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Framework for Raising Successful Kids</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, prioritizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing big emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. The framework encourages parents to do their own internal work to become less reactive and to reconnect with their children after conflicts, fostering resilience, trust, and connection.</p>

          <p>Daniella Pierson, who built a $40 million business from her newsletter The Newsette, is launching CHASM to assist women in securing venture capital funding. Pierson faced numerous rejections from VCs early in her career and wants to help other women overcome similar barriers. The amount of funding received by all-women teams remains low, accounting for only a small percentage of total VC funding. Pierson's goal is to level the playing field and provide opportunities for women entrepreneurs who are often overlooked by traditional investors.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but also shared the story of his truck being repossessed after he missed payments due to changing banks. He explained that he missed three payments and his truck was taken in the middle of the night. Paul found out about the repossession when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage for packages, only to find his truck missing. He later regained the truck, describing the experience as funny and posting footage of the repossession on social media.</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, helped change military protocol for casualty notifications after experiencing the fear of receiving a death notice via telegram. During the Vietnam War, she made a deal with the local Western Union office to call her whenever a telegram arrived, allowing her to comfort the widows personally. Together with other Army wives, Moore successfully lobbied the base commander to have service members notify families in person and offer support. This legacy is honored at Ft. Moore, formerly Ft. Benning, where she and her husband are remembered for their service.</p>
