          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the deportation or detention of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, citing concerns over the Trump administration's use of foreign policy interests as justification. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities compromised U.S. foreign policy. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged and his speech chilled, leading to irreparable harm. While the government could still pursue deportation based on alleged omissions on his green card application, the judge determined the current detention was primarily due to Rubio's determination.</p>
