          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival focused on youth and cultural preservation, showcasing a diverse group of international artisans. The event featured a Guatemalan Maya artist painting murals to keep her indigenous identity alive, and Bolivian rappers who blend Spanish with native languages like Quechua to connect with their heritage. Other participants included fourth-generation Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton and refugee weavers from Myanmar dedicated to revitalizing their ancient craft, all sharing their traditions with younger generations.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring further regulations to enhance online safety for children, signaling that current measures are just the beginning. A cabinet minister stated that the government will not "sit back and wait," with the Technology Secretary looking into actions to address issues like addictive online habits among young people. This comes as new rules under the Online Safety Act, requiring stricter age verification and content filtering by tech platforms, are set to be enforced by the regulator Ofcom later this month.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating its first-ever state agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness issues. This bureaucratic reshuffle aims to elevate the topic to the cabinet level and bring more focus and efficiency to the state's sprawling network of affordable housing programs. While supporters see it as a long-overdue first step, the plan's effectiveness will depend on its ability to streamline a fragmented system and coordinate between the governor's office and the independently elected state treasurer.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Caltech are pioneering a new method for ocean exploration by creating cyborg jellyfish, or "biohybrid" devices. By embedding small, low-cost microelectric controllers into live jellyfish, researchers can remotely guide their movements to collect environmental data on temperature and pressure from the deep sea. Since jellyfish lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, the process is considered humane and leverages the animals' natural ability to withstand extreme ocean depths, potentially revolutionizing access to underwater research for scientists globally.</p>

          <p>The third and final bout between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano symbolized a significant evolution in women's boxing, highlighting that female fighters no longer need to deliver chaotic brawls to prove their legitimacy. The fight was more tactical and controlled, a sign of progress that grants women the right to fight smart and win ugly, just as their male counterparts do. This article reflects on the sport's contradictions, where women reclaim their bodies for risk and glory in an arena still marked by objectification, ultimately defining greatness on their own terms.</p>

Scientific analysis confirmed its origin, making it an exceptionally rare find that represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic products to list ingredients in plain English rather than Latin to better protect consumers with allergies. Current regulations require companies to use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) system, which uses Latin-based names that are often indecipherable to the public. Advocates, including a Member of Parliament with a severe nut allergy, argue this practice poses a serious risk and that cosmetic labeling should be as clear and accessible as food packaging.</p>
