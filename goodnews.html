          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India finished the first day at 310-5 against England, anchored by a patient century from captain Shubman Gill. After England chose to bowl first, their bowlers fought hard on a flat pitch, with Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse taking early wickets. Despite an elegant 87 from Yashasvi Jaiswal, England managed to take key wickets in the afternoon, leaving India at 211-5 at one point. However, Gill's slow but steady century, combined with an unbeaten 99-run partnership with Ravindra Jadeja, ensured India ended the day in a solid, if not dominant, position.</p>

          <p>Researchers are launching a new mission to solve the 88-year-old mystery of Amelia Earhart's disappearance, spurred by a satellite image that may show her aircraft on a remote Pacific island. The image, taken over Nikumaroro in Kiribati, appears to show an object matching the size and material of Earhart's Lockheed Electra 10E. Purdue University, where Earhart taught, is organizing an expedition to the island in November to investigate the site and potentially recover the wreckage. While some experts are skeptical, proponents of the theory point to the location's proximity to her intended route and where emergency radio transmissions were believed to have originated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is escalating its efforts to combat the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite that poses a severe threat to livestock, wildlife, and potentially humans. The plan involves breeding billions of male screwworm flies, sterilizing them with radiation, and releasing them over Mexico and southern Texas. This technique, known as the sterile insect technique, causes wild females to lay unfertilized eggs, leading to a population collapse. The move is a response to the pest's recent appearance in southern Mexico, prompting the USDA to establish a new fly factory and distribution center to protect the American beef industry from devastating infestations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic conditions shift with falling inflation and anticipated interest rate cuts, savers with significant funds should carefully consider their options, such as a certificate of deposit (CD). Before committing $10,000 to a CD, it's crucial to evaluate whether a short-term or long-term CD is more beneficial, as current rate trends have inverted historical norms. Savers must also assess if they can afford to have a large sum of money inaccessible for the entire term, as early withdrawal penalties can be substantial. Finally, one should compare CD rates to alternatives like high-yield savings or money market accounts, which offer comparable returns with greater liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) and associated stocks experienced a rise in value, driven by renewed investor enthusiasm for the crypto asset, particularly around the concept of tokenization. Companies that have adopted ETH as a primary treasury asset, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, saw significant stock jumps. This surge in interest is linked to the growing use of stablecoins and the broader potential of tokenizing real-world assets on blockchain networks like Ethereum. The trend follows Robinhood's announcement of tokenized stock trading in Europe and BlackRock's tokenized money market fund, highlighting Ethereum's foundational role in this emerging financial technology.

After losing the first set, Norrie battled back to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 in a high-level, thrilling encounter on Court One. The victory marks the second consecutive four-set match for Norrie in the tournament and provides encouragement that he can make another deep run like his 2022 semi-final appearance. However, the day saw mixed results for British players, as Katie Boulter was unexpectedly knocked out by lucky loser Solana Sierra from Argentina.</p>

Adenot collaborated with renowned Michelin-starred chef Anne-Sophie Pic to develop a special menu that brings French haute cuisine to space. These "bonus meals" are designed to boost morale and help astronauts feel connected to Earth, providing a welcome change from the typical freeze-dried space food. The dishes had to be specially prepared to meet the strict ISS requirements, such as being crumb-free and having a long shelf life, in what the chef called an "exhilarating challenge."</p>

          <p>New research from Tufts University indicates that consuming coffee with minimal or no sugar and cream could be associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. The study's findings, as reported by the article, also show that individuals who drink their coffee black have a 14% lower risk of all-cause mortality when compared to those who do not drink coffee at all. This suggests that the potential health benefits of coffee might be most pronounced when it is consumed without the addition of common sweeteners and dairy products, which can add significant calories, sugar, and fat to the beverage.</p>

          <p>For the first time, researchers have successfully sequenced the entire genome of an ancient Egyptian, revealing new insights into the ancestry of early inhabitants of the Nile Valley. The DNA, extracted from a man who lived between 4,500 and 4,800 years ago, showed that 80% of his genetic material came from ancient North African populations, while a surprising 20% traced back to West Asia and Mesopotamia. This genetic evidence supports archaeological theories of cultural connections and migration between ancient Egypt and societies in the Fertile Crescent. The man's remains were unusually well-preserved inside a sealed clay pot, which protected the DNA from degradation.</p>

          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) system outages and a surge in summer travel, airlines and pilots are highlighting the multiple layers of redundant systems and training designed to ensure safety. Pilots are trained from their earliest days to handle lost communications with ATC, using backup radio frequencies, an emergency channel, and text-based messaging systems. All airliners are also equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) that automatically communicates with other aircraft to prevent mid-air collisions. While these protocols ensure safety, officials note that ATC disruptions will inevitably lead to flight delays and passenger inconvenience as traffic is limited in affected areas.</p>
