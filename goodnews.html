        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a rally after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The approval came with the condition that U.S. Steel and Nippon sign a national security agreement with the U.S. government, which they have now done. This agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions such as relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S. U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, with the transaction expected to be completed promptly.</p>

          <p>Florida has removed a record haul of invasive Burmese pythons in an effort to curb the population. Biologists have removed 20 tons of pythons from waters in and around the Everglades in little more than a decade. Experts concede that they will probably never be completely eradicated, but that progress is being made. Harnessing public fascination with pythons has been a significant tool aiding efforts to remove them, and that the efforts have been successful enough to see a demographic shift in the size of pythons in certain areas.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, which charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, has led to noticeably less traffic. The policy aims to reduce congestion and raise funds for the city's public transit system. Early results show a decrease in traffic and an increase in bus speeds, with public transit ridership reaching its highest level since the pandemic. The program, however, faces ongoing political opposition, particularly from conservatives, and is threatened by the Trump administration's efforts to revoke federal approval.</p>
