          <p>UCLA's softball team was defeated by Tennessee in a 5-4 extra-innings heartbreaker, ending their Women's College World Series run. Megan Grant hit a game-tying home run in the seventh, but Tennessee ultimately prevailed with a walk-off single in the bottom of the ninth. The Bruins struggled to capitalize with the bases loaded in the ninth, while the Volunteers delivered the decisive hit. Despite solo home runs from Alexis Ramirez and Sofia Mujica, UCLA's season concluded with a 55-13 record. The team's overall strong performance this season is a point of pride despite the disappointing ending.</p>

The story highlights the influence of institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and the Sydney Theatre Company. NIDA's rigorous training, which emphasizes skill, confidence, and a lack of self-indulgence, has produced stars like Sarah Snook, Cate Blanchett, and Hugh Jackman. The report also emphasizes the importance of Australian soap operas as a training ground and the unique Aussie attitude of taking the work seriously but not themselves.

          <p>A powerful geomagnetic storm is forecasted to make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The storm is caused by a coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Despite the potential disruptions, the event offers a rare opportunity to witness the aurora borealis in regions where it is not typically visible.

          <p>A law professor at USC, Angela Zhang, discusses how US tech curbs are pushing China to innovate, especially in artificial intelligence. Tariffs make it harder for Chinese tech products to compete in the US market, but also force Chinese companies to cut costs and scale up. Many Chinese tech firms started open-sourcing their AI models, which is a more cost-effective and collaborative way to keep developing advanced technologies when resources are tight. Chinese companies are looking more aggressively to other markets and deepening trade with Europe, including offering technology transfers in exchange for market access. Despite challenges, Chinese firms are going to keep pushing hard to make their products even more competitive.</p>
