          <h2>Conscious Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on years of studying parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests that parents can foster cooperation by using specific phrases that respect a child's autonomy and emotional safety. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering learning and cooperation. Instead of using threats or demands, parents should explain their reasoning, acknowledge their child's feelings, and invite problem-solving. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children. The author's research suggests that the real secret to getting kids to listen is not about controlling their behavior, it is about creating conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

Patients will receive wrap-around care, including exercise and diet support, though availability may vary by location. Pharmacy trade organizations are concerned that demand may exceed supply, and some GP practices are warning ineligible patients not to book appointments.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric, due to long-term planning and government funding. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. This has allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production and build the world's largest public charging network. While some Western countries view this as unfair business practice, Chinese EV executives insist that all companies have access to the same resources.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is hoping to establish a clinic by the end of the year to offer ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This development follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. While ketamine is primarily known as a medical anesthetic and recreational drug, there is growing interest in its potential to treat severe depression. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is often hard for people with overpayment problems to find lawyers to represent them because there is little financial incentive for attorneys to take on these cases. If you receive Social Security retirement benefits, one of the best ways to prevent overpayments is to check the earnings history Social Security has on record for you. If you're receiving Social Security disability benefits and decide to go back to work, you need to be extra careful. If you notice a mistake, whether it is with the earnings history Social Security has for you, or with the payments Social Security is sending, you must let the agency know about it as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>A magistrate judge in Tennessee has denied the government's motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the mistakenly deported Salvadoran native who was brought back to the United States earlier this month. In her order on Sunday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said the court "will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed." Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. A hearing has been scheduled to review the conditions of release.</p>

          <p>Minjee Lee of Australia secured her third major title by winning the PGA Championship with a three-shot victory. She shot a two-over-par 74 on her final round in Texas, holding off the chasing pack in windy conditions. Lee was one of only three players to finish below par for the weekend, adding the PGA Championship win to major victories at the 2021 Evian Championship and 2022 Women's US Open. Her performance was particularly impressive given the difficult conditions and high scoring averages.</p>
