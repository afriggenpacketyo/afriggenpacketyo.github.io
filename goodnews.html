          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences with business failure, highlighting the intense personal and professional challenges involved. Serial entrepreneur Ismael Dainehine and others describe the process as painful, often leading to a loss of identity and the difficult task of laying off employees. The article explores how founders transition back to corporate life, where they may face an "entrepreneurship penalty" from recruiters but can also be highly valuable employees due to their broad experience. Ultimately, reframing success around a deep sense of purpose is key to bouncing back.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its entry requirements for many travelers. The country now offers several visa-free options, including a transit program that allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days in many parts of the mainland. Recently, Beijing also extended its 30-day visa-free stay policy to include Russian citizens. These measures are designed to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have traditionally made visiting China more difficult for international tourists.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases more than just a battle for the title; it highlights the vast financial gap in the sport. England's team is fully professional, with players on full-time contracts backed by millions in funding. In contrast, the Canadian team relies on minimal national funding and had to launch a public fundraising campaign to cover its World Cup preparations. Despite the disparity, Canada has performed exceptionally, demonstrating that clever preparation and player dedication can challenge even the best-funded teams on the world stage.</p>

          <p>As England's women's rugby team competes in the World Cup final as full-time professionals, many players reflect on the careers they pursued before the game was professionalized. Hooker Amy Cokayne continues to serve as an officer in the Royal Air Force, while veteran Marlie Packer, part of the 2014 amateur winning squad, was a plumber who took unpaid leave to play. Other stars, like Lark Atkin-Davies and Hannah Botterman, were a primary school teacher and a painter, respectively. Their stories highlight the dramatic evolution of women's rugby and the dedication required before professional contracts became available.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is promoting an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, arguing it would benefit the nation's economy and growth prospects. The proposed scheme would allow young people aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, similar to existing agreements with countries like Australia and Japan. Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic benefits of such a deal into its forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposal faces criticism from conservatives who view it as a partial return to freedom of movement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are making significant strides in reducing the nation's dependence on U.S. semiconductor technology. Spurred by U.S. trade restrictions, Huawei has unveiled its latest Ascend AI chips and hardware, designed as powerful alternatives to Nvidia's processors. Simultaneously, DeepSeek, developer of a world-class AI model, announced a shift toward supporting these domestically produced chips. This growing confidence in home-grown technology aligns with Beijing's directive for its tech giants to stop purchasing Nvidia chips tailored for the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. However, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a standard Smartmatic must still prove to be awarded damages. Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, has vowed to continue his fight against voting machine companies.</p>
