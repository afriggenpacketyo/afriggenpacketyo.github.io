          <p>President Trump announced the conclusion of a major trade and military deal with the Philippines, which he claims includes a 19% tariff on Filipino goods while US exports remain tariff-free. The announcement, made on social media, followed a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has not yet confirmed the agreement. Marcos had highlighted the need to modernize his country's military due to Chinese aggression, stating the US is assisting in their self-reliance defense program. The White House and the Philippine Embassy have not provided further details on the proclaimed deal.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will introduce a version of its classic cola sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall, shifting from the high-fructose corn syrup used since the 1980s. This move follows the growing popularity of "Mexican Coke" and comes after President Trump expressed enthusiasm for the idea. Despite the change, research does not indicate that cane sugar is healthier than high-fructose corn syrup, and it is a more expensive ingredient due to US sugar tariffs. The company is also expanding its portfolio of lower-sugar options, such as Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This fall, PepsiCo will introduce a new prebiotic soda in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, catering to growing consumer demand for healthier, functional beverages. The new drink will contain prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and have 30 calories per serving, with no artificial sweeteners. This launch follows PepsiCo's recent acquisition of the prebiotic soda brand Poppi and reflects a broader industry trend toward gut-healthy alternatives. While overall demand for carbonated drinks remains high, this move aims to boost sales by appealing to health-conscious consumers in a rapidly growing market segment.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has conducted a significant reshuffle of her senior team, appointing former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary. In this role, Cleverly will directly challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner in Parliament. Badenoch stated the changes aim to bring more experienced "heavy hitters" to the front bench as the party enters a "new phase." The reshuffle also includes new appointments for the shadow transport and health secretaries, occurring as the Conservative party continues to poll poorly after its last election defeat.</p>

The 45-year-old, who underwent a procedure for uterine fibroids last year, expressed joy at simply being able to play again, noting a significant improvement in her health. Williams humorously joked that her sister Serena, with whom she won 14 major doubles titles, had been "in the way" of this new partnership. Her comeback continues with a singles match, highlighting her enduring passion and resilience in the sport.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Los Angeles International Airport discovered and seized a significant drug shipment of nearly 300 pounds of methamphetamine.

This seizure is the latest in a series of creative smuggling attempts thwarted at LAX, which have included drugs disguised as dog shampoo and hidden in soaked clothing. The agency highlighted the incident as another example of its daily efforts to intercept illegal narcotics trafficking through the airport.</p>

          <p>Howard Phillips, a 65-year-old man from Essex, has been found guilty of trying to spy for what he believed were Russian intelligence agents under the UK's National Security Act.

He had applied for a job with the UK Border Force as part of his plan and left a USB stick with information for his handlers. Phillips, whose ex-wife said he was "infatuated" with being like James Bond, was arrested in May after a sting operation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of working Americans with a side hustle has decreased for the first time since 2017, dropping to 27% from 36% last year, according to a new Bankrate survey. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, allowing people to feel less economic pressure. In previous years, many relied on second jobs to cover basic living expenses amid high inflation. Now, more are using extra income for discretionary spending, suggesting a reduction in economic anxiety, though this trend could reverse if inflation rises again.</p>

          <p>Dottie Dorion, a 91-year-old athlete and avid Peloton user, successfully campaigned for the fitness company to create new age categories for its oldest riders. After a 14-month effort involving letters and legal assistance, Peloton added 90+ and 100+ age brackets, allowing seniors to compete more fairly with their peers. Dorion, a veteran of over 250 marathons and triathlons, felt it was unfair to be grouped with "those young 80-year-olds." Her persistence highlights a commitment to fitness at any age and demonstrates the power of individual advocacy in shaping corporate policy.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is reportedly on the verge of finalizing a deal to sign Swedish striker Viktor Gyokeres from Sporting for a fee of around £63.5 million. While personal terms have been agreed upon, the completion of the transfer was slightly delayed by negotiations over add-on payments between the two clubs. Gyokeres, who had an impressive season scoring 54 goals in 52 games, has been a key target for Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. The signing is aimed at bolstering the team's offensive power after they finished behind Liverpool in the Premier League last season.</p>
