        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee reports increased adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, highlighting progress toward the nation's net-zero emissions goal by 2050. While electric car sales are nearly one-in-five new cars sold in 2024, heat pump sales remain below target despite recent growth. The committee emphasizes the need for government action to lower electricity bills, making clean technologies more affordable for households. Removing charges related to older renewable energy projects from electricity bills could significantly reduce costs for consumers, incentivizing further adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. The government continues to work on delivering clean power for families and businesses.</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral primary features a contest between left-wing Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo, reflecting an internal battle within the Democratic Party. Mamdani, endorsed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, campaigns on affordability issues, including free public transit and universal childcare. Cuomo, seeking a comeback after resigning amid scandal, is viewed as the moderate establishment candidate with strong ties to the city's political history. The election utilizes ranked-choice voting, potentially influencing the outcome as voters rank their top five candidates. Mamdani has been compared to Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and is focused on making the city more affordable.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding $5 billion in funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. Judge Tana Lin granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The Trump administration had suspended the funding, citing a review of the program's policies, but the Government Accountability Office found the withholding unlawful. During his campaign, Trump expressed opposition to electric vehicles, contrasting with his later appointment of Elon Musk to a government efficiency role.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire between Iran and Israel appears to be holding after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a truce. However, an initial intelligence assessment suggests that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a few months. The report indicates that only the entrances to the deeply buried facility in Fordow were destroyed, while the underground structures remained intact. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt criticized the publication of the report, calling it "flat-out wrong." Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has vowed a return to normal life and expressed openness to resuming nuclear negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, offering new insights into the Milky Way's past. Using data from the Gaia space telescope, researchers studied thousands of stars and found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

Recent moves include expanding the range of tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan.

          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived about 150 million years ago. This labrador-sized dinosaur was previously misclassified as a Nanosaurus. The discovery sheds light on the evolutionary history of early small dinosaurs and their transition into larger animals. Scientists concluded the creature was a new species based on unique features in its leg bones. The museum is formally erasing the category of Nanosaurus and believes other small dinosaur specimens from this period are likely distinct species.</p>
