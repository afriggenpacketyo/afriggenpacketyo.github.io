This article highlights the substantial economic impact of the yen's depreciation, which is effectively drawing in a wealthier demographic of tourists and providing a considerable boost to Japan's tourism and retail sectors.</p>

          <p>Dodgers catcher Will Smith has been diagnosed with a hairline fracture in his right hand, casting doubt on his return before the regular season concludes and making his playoff availability "up in the air." The injury, which initially did not appear on X-rays or MRIs, stemmed from a foul ball hit earlier this month. Despite Smith's significant batting average and home run contributions, the Dodgers have maintained strong performance in his absence, largely due to the unexpected emergence of journeyman catcher Ben Rortvedt. This article details the critical injury to the three-time All-Star and the team's cautious optimism for his recovery ahead of the postseason.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk predicts a future by 2030 where AI and robots will replace nearly all human jobs, leading to a "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance" for all, encompassing the best medical care, food, housing, and transport. He envisions intelligent humanoid robots far exceeding the human population, with individuals desiring their own personal robots. However, critics express skepticism about the financial viability and political feasibility of funding such a comprehensive universal income system, citing existing national debt and resistance to even modest basic income proposals. This article explores Musk's highly optimistic forecast for an AI-driven society, contrasting it with practical challenges and doubts (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Research Explores Creatine's Potential to Combat Brain Fog and Improve Cognitive Function</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a widely popular muscle-boosting supplement, is increasingly being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in addressing "brain fog." While primarily recognized for enhancing athletic performance by fueling high-intensity workouts, a growing body of evidence suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. The article explains that creatine helps cells produce energy, and increasing its stores in the brain, similar to muscles, could enhance cognitive function. Experts, however, caution that while it shows promise, especially for individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies, more extensive research is required before it can be considered a definitive solution.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a proposed deal for TikTok's US operations, which would grant American companies control over the app's powerful algorithm and allocate six of seven board seats to Americans. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt anticipates the agreement, involving tech giant Oracle for data and privacy management, could be signed "in the coming days," though Beijing has yet to confirm. This development follows repeated threats by the US to ban TikTok over national security concerns related to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
