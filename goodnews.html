          <p>Verizon has entered a definitive commercial agreement with AST SpaceMobile to provide direct-to-cell phone satellite connectivity across the continental United States, starting next year. The partnership aims to eliminate cellular dead zones by leveraging Verizon's low-band spectrum with AST's space-based network, ensuring coverage for Verizon customers in remote areas. Following the announcement, AST SpaceMobile's stock surged significantly, reflecting investor confidence in the company's technology, which it claims is the first of its kind to operate directly with standard mobile devices.</p>

          <p>In the second quarter of 2025, real estate investors purchased one-third of all single-family homes sold in the U.S., the highest proportion in five years. While the total number of homes bought by investors decreased compared to last year, their market share grew due to an overall slowdown in home sales. The data shows that small investors, owning ten or fewer properties, continue to dominate the market, while large institutional investors have been net sellers for six consecutive quarters. This trend indicates investors are providing crucial liquidity and inventory to a weakened housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-08 08:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tax strategy known as qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) is being described as a significant, yet underutilized, benefit for retirees. The move allows individuals aged 70½ or older to directly transfer up to $108,000 from a pretax IRA to a charity, satisfying their required minimum distributions (RMDs) without increasing their adjusted gross income. This exclusion from income is more beneficial than a standard deduction, as it can help retirees avoid higher Medicare premiums. Financial experts recommend this as an effective way for philanthropic retirees to maximize their giving and tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>German Cabinet Approves Law Allowing Police to Shoot Down Drones</h2>

          <p>The German government has approved new legislation that would grant federal police the authority to shoot down unmanned aerial systems, or drones, that pose a threat. The draft law states that police can use "appropriate technical means" against a drone, its control unit, or its connection if other methods are futile or more difficult. This move aims to enhance security capabilities against the growing threat posed by drones. The legislation comes as officials also debate the role of the German military in assisting police with drone defense, particularly in scenarios beyond their reach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees avoided elimination from the AL Division Series by mounting a dramatic comeback to defeat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-6. Trailing by five runs early in the game, the Yankees were sparked by Aaron Judge, who hit a game-tying three-run homer and drove in four runs total. The rally was aided by two costly errors from the Blue Jays and strong performances from the Yankees' bullpen, which held Toronto scoreless for the final six innings. The victory narrows the series to 2-1, forcing a Game 4 in New York.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend known as "locking in" has become popular among Gen Z, describing a period of intense focus on personal goals, often as a reaction to digital overload and economic anxiety. The movement, popularized on platforms like TikTok, involves eliminating distractions and dedicating oneself to self-improvement in areas like fitness or finances. This phenomenon reflects a generational shift from millennial "hustle culture," focusing more on personal well-being and work-life balance rather than traditional career advancement. It serves as both a coping mechanism and an act of resistance against an uncertain future.</p>

          <p>Championship club Watford has fired head coach Paulo Pezzolano after only 10 games and has brought back former manager Javi Gracia. Pezzolano was the club's 12th manager since Gracia's first tenure ended in 2019, reflecting a period of significant instability. Despite recent improvements in results, the club's board opted for a change, expressing confidence that Gracia's experience and leadership will bring stability and a stronger connection with supporters. Gracia was a popular figure during his first spell, leading the team to its best-ever Premier League finish and an FA Cup final.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, a mathematics professor diagnosed with autism in his 30s argues against the harmful narrative that treats autism as a tragedy to be cured. He recounts his personal struggles but also highlights how autistic traits like persistence and pattern recognition have been strengths in his career. The author draws parallels to the historical eugenics movement and the deaf community's concept of "deaf gain," insisting that neurodivergence is a valuable part of human diversity. He concludes that the world benefits from different ways of thinking and that conversations about eliminating autism are a dangerous debate.</p>
