          <p>Samsung Electronics has secured a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirming his company is the counterparty. The deal, which runs until the end of 2033, is for the production of Tesla's next-generation AI chips. Musk highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership, stating that Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to producing Tesla's AI6 chip. This development is significant for Samsung's foundry business, which has been trailing competitors in the AI chip market.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework agreement on trade, averting a larger conflict. The deal, which sets a 15% US tariff on many EU goods, is being hailed as a significant win for President Donald Trump, as the rate is higher than before his administration's tariff changes. However, it is also viewed as a partial success for the EU, as it is lower than the threatened 30% and offers stability amid sluggish European economic growth. The article suggests that President Trump's personal involvement was key to finalizing the agreement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material, as part of an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The network had amassed over 120,000 members and millions of illicit files, with at least 18 individuals convicted for their roles in leading and using the platforms. The operation, which began in 2020, led to the arrest of key figures, including one administrator described as a significant global purveyor of such material. Officials are hailing the takedown as one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's technology hub, have implemented new rules calling for leniency toward innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that researchers and units should not be punished or have their future funding prospects hindered if projects stall due to reasonable circumstances, such as technical difficulties or market changes, provided no misconduct was involved. The move is designed to encourage bold exploration in science and technology by creating a mechanism that protects innovators from the negative consequences of ambitious but unsuccessful research.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of a trade deal setting a 15% tariff on EU goods entering the US, European leaders have expressed a sense of relief, though with some reservations. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the agreement "positive" for ensuring stability, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed it for averting a damaging trade conflict. Leaders from Ireland and the Netherlands also acknowledged that while zero tariffs would have been preferable, the deal provides much-needed clarity and predictability for businesses. The reactions highlight a collective view that the agreement, while a compromise, is better than the threatened alternative of higher tariffs.</p>

          <p>The excavation of a 2,500-year-old urban settlement in Keeladi, Tamil Nadu, has ignited a fierce political and historical debate in India. The findings, which include elaborate brick structures and evidence of a literate society, challenge the long-held narrative that civilization spread from the north to the south. Some archaeologists and politicians in Tamil Nadu claim the site proves an independent and equally ancient southern civilization, possibly predating northern scripts. This has turned the site into a symbol of Tamil pride and identity, fueling tensions with the BJP-led federal government over historical interpretations.</p>

          <p>An investigative report details the remarkable search for a Skyvan PA-51 airplane used by Argentina's military dictatorship for "death flights," where political prisoners were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean. Journalist Miriam Lewin, a survivor of a detention camp herself, and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo spent years tracking the plane, eventually finding it in the U.S. and obtaining its flight logs. This crucial evidence documented the clandestine flights, identified the pilots, and became a key part of a historic trial that convicted dozens for crimes against humanity, bringing a measure of justice and truth.</p>
