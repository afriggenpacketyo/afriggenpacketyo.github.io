          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which anticipates price increases to offset tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports to reduce reliance on any single country outside the U.S. Home Depot reported mixed fiscal first-quarter results, missing earnings expectations but exceeding sales estimates, with executives attributing dampened home improvement spending to high interest rates and economic uncertainty.

          <p>Japan is reportedly considering easing its demand for a full removal of U.S. tariffs to strike a trade deal with the United States, potentially conceding lower duty rates due to President Trump's reluctance to fully respond to Japan's original request. Other key headlines include Prime Minister Ishiba's defense of the farm minister amidst criticism over insensitive rice comments, Honda's decision to cut its EV investment plan by 30% due to lower-than-expected market growth, and the government's proposal of 17 eligible sectors under a new foreign labor training plan to address labor shortages.</p>

          <p>For senior homeowners seeking to tap into their home equity, experts are weighing the pros and cons of HELOCs and reverse mortgages. HELOCs offer a flexible line of credit with lower interest rates compared to credit cards and personal loans, making them suitable for short-term financing needs like home improvements or debt consolidation. Reverse mortgages, on the other hand, allow seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, ideal for those with limited financial resources who want to age in place, but they come with higher costs and erode home equity over time.
