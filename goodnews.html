          <h2>Supreme Court Limits Scope of Environmental Impact Studies for Infrastructure Projects</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 14:41:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court ruled 8-0 to limit the scope of environmental impact statements required for major infrastructure projects under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Justice Kavanaugh, writing for the majority, stated that NEPA had been used excessively to hinder infrastructure development. The ruling arose from a case involving a proposed railway in Utah, where environmental groups argued that the impact study failed to consider downstream effects like oil spills and greenhouse gas emissions. The court's decision aims to expedite project approvals by focusing on direct impacts rather than broader, secondary consequences, with proponents claiming it will boost the economy by facilitating energy transport. Optimism is present due to the potential for faster economic development.</p>

The World Health Organization recognized snakebite envenoming as a neglected tropical disease in 2017, but progress has been limited.
