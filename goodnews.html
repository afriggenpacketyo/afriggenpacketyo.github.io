          <p>Pride Month is approaching, a period dedicated to honoring the history, impact, and resilience of the LGBTQ+ community. The word "pride" has transformed from denoting excessive self-esteem to symbolizing LGBTQ+ empowerment and strength. Originating from the Christian concept of the seven deadly sins, pride initially represented unchecked self-importance. However, influenced by the civil rights movement and pivotal events like the Stonewall Uprising, the LGBTQ+ community embraced "pride" to assert their worth and challenge negative stereotypes, with the rallying cry, "Say it loud, gay is proud." Despite progress, the LGBTQ+ community faces ongoing challenges, making "pride" a vital symbol of resilience.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive compensation, potentially up to ¬£1,000, due to the scandal involving the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are allocating over ¬£70 million in compensation and financial support to affected customers, following a review by Ofgem. The review revealed that suppliers often switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their agreement, particularly during the cost of living crisis. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent, and enforcement investigations are continuing for British Gas, Utilita and Ovo.</p>

The cameras aim to reduce shoplifting by identifying when items are not scanned correctly, showing a live-action replay to the customer. This move follows a record high in shoplifting in the UK in 2024, with retailers facing significant losses. While some welcome the tech as a way to improve the checkout process, others fear it could lead to more invasive surveillance measures.</p>

          <p>A German court in Hamm dismissed a climate case brought by a Peruvian farmer against energy giant RWE, who sought damages for potential flooding due to melting glaciers. Judges ruled that the damage to the plaintiff's property was not significant enough, denying an appeal. Despite the dismissal, Germanwatch, an NGO supporting the plaintiff, hailed the ruling as a "groundbreaking" and "historic landmark" that can be invoked by affected individuals worldwide. The case, initiated by Saul Luciano Lluiya, aimed to hold RWE accountable for its contribution to climate change and the melting of glaciers threatening his town.</p>

          <p>Auto giant Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, previously North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. This decision follows a months-long search to fill the company's leadership void after Carlos Tavares' unexpected resignation. Filosa will assume his new role effective June 23, succeeding Tavares at a pivotal time for the industry. Stellantis, which owns brands such as Jeep, Dodge, and Fiat, recently reported a downturn in revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>Antony's impact on loan at Real Betis has been so significant that the Spanish club's players are jokingly willing to go to extreme lengths to keep him.

          <h2>Japan Government Pledges Rice Supply to Rural Areas Amid Price Surge</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to provide lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas amid a surge in rice prices. This decision comes after the government suspended taking orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller ones. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries plans to allocate 100,000 tons of reserve rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. The government is working to ease the burden on households facing doubled retail rice prices, with reserve rice likely sold at around 1,800 yen per 5 kilograms.</p>
