          <p>The article explores the evolving debate surrounding universal basic income (UBI) and direct cash transfers, highlighting recent studies that found limited long-term improvements in mental health or financial well-being among recipients. This research has invigorated critics on the right, who argue against no-strings-attached aid, and sparked nuanced discussions on the left about cash's role versus other social services. Despite some dampened enthusiasm, the movement for cash assistance continues, with advocates emphasizing its proven effectiveness in reducing poverty, ensuring housing, and supporting families through emergencies. New, larger-scale experiments are still being explored, indicating the policy remains a significant area of focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is poised to report its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating adjusted earnings per share of $1.01 and revenue of $46.02 billion, marking a projected 53% year-over-year growth. This explosive growth is largely fueled by the company's data center business, which accounts for 88% of total sales, driven by insatiable demand for GPUs in the generative AI era. Key areas of focus for analysts include the sales performance of Nvidia's new Blackwell chips and the evolving state of its business in China, particularly in light of export controls and China's push for domestic chip usage. The company forecasts approximately $53 billion in sales for its fiscal third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Separately, O'Leary expressed strong skepticism about the UK's sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate, calling it "nonsense" due to a lack of supply and predicting a material drop in oil prices over the next decade.

          <p>This article analyzes how three major retailers—Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below—are implementing distinct strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Abercrombie diversifies its global supply chain and avoids widespread price increases, despite facing higher-than-anticipated tariff costs. Best Buy strategically front-loaded its freight but has less reliance on Chinese products. Five Below, while heavily exposed to Chinese tariffs, benefits from its flexible inventory and opportunistic purchasing to manage costs. The article emphasizes that the effectiveness of these strategies varies based on a retailer's product categories, supply chain structure, and consumer price sensitivity, with larger retailers potentially better able to absorb costs.</p>
