          <p>The UK's Green Party is undergoing a leadership election that highlights a strategic crossroads for the organization. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for a bold, "eco-populist" approach to connect with voter anger, contrasting with the more traditional, broad-appeal strategy of his opponents, Adrian Ramsay and Ellie Chowns. This contest occurs after the party achieved record success in the last general election, prompting a debate on whether to embrace a radical new direction or stick with their proven formula. The outcome will determine the party's path as it navigates a fragmented political landscape and the emergence of a new left-wing party.</p>

Scheffler's final-round 67 took him to 15 under par for the tournament, capitalizing on a difficult start for MacIntyre, who posted back-to-back bogeys. Despite some late-round nerves from both players, Scheffler sealed his 18th PGA Tour victory with a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole. MacIntyre finished in second place at 13 under, continuing a strong season that includes a runner-up finish at the U.S. Open.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has won the LIV Golf individual season-long championship for the second year in a row, earning the top prize of $18 million. His victory was confirmed despite losing a playoff to Sebastian Munoz at the event in Indiana. Rahm finished the tournament at 22 under par, which was sufficient to edge out Joaquin Niemann for the overall title. The result also had positive implications for European Ryder Cup veterans Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both performed well enough to avoid relegation from the LIV tour for the 2026 season.</p>

          <p>Jing Qian, a managing director at the Asia Society's Centre for China Analysis, provides insight into the recent U.S.-China trade talks, characterizing them as a continuation of principles established at the Geneva summit. He notes that when negotiators met in May, a shared interest in de-escalation was paramount due to rattled markets and a dim global economic forecast. The discussions involved high-level officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice-Premier He Lifeng. Qian's analysis explores the complex interplay between the domestic political landscapes of both nations and their foreign policy strategies, framing the rivalry as potentially manageable.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that while balances in traditional checking and savings accounts are declining, Americans' total cash reserves are growing, particularly in higher-yield options like money market funds and certificates of deposit (CDs). This trend, most pronounced among lower-income households, helps explain the continued strength of consumer spending despite inflation. Households are strategically moving funds to accounts offering better returns, such as high-yield savings accounts and brokerage accounts, to preserve and grow their capital. This shift reflects a broader adaptation to economic pressures, where savers are becoming more sophisticated in managing their money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russia has agreed in principle to allow the U.S. and Europe to provide Ukraine with "robust" security guarantees as part of a potential peace agreement. Witkoff stated that this concession, made during the Alaska summit, could involve "Article 5-like language," referencing NATO's collective defense clause, which could serve as an alternative to full NATO membership for Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the offer "historic" ahead of his meeting in Washington with President Trump and European leaders. The specifics of these guarantees and territorial concessions, including the status of the Donbas region, are set to be major topics of discussion.</p>

          <p>Dr. Colleen Crowley, an American psychologist, describes her family's move from a comfortable life in Montecito, California, to northern Spain as a transformative experience that has significantly increased their happiness and quality of life.

Despite challenges like integrating into a close-knit local culture and navigating slower bureaucracy, they have found the change refreshing, with a better work-life balance and a lower cost of living.
