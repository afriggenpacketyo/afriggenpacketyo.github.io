          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 07:04:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines practical steps for homebuyers to obtain better mortgage terms as the average 30-year fixed rate approaches a one-year low. Key recommendations include improving one's FICO credit score by paying bills on time and reducing revolving debt, which can significantly lower interest payments over the loan's lifetime. Additionally, the article suggests making a larger down payment of 20% to reduce risk for lenders and considering alternatives to traditional 30-year fixed loans, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>India is actively rebalancing its foreign policy, strengthening ties with China and Russia while facing new trade frictions with the United States under the Trump administration. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent high-profile interactions with leaders Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin signal a strategy of "multi-alignment" rather than a definitive shift away from Washington. Foreign policy experts suggest this is a pragmatic approach to maintain strategic autonomy in a volatile global environment, leveraging relationships across different power blocs to serve India's national interests without fully committing to any single alliance.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates are continuing a sharp downward trend, with the 30-year fixed rate falling to 6.12% ahead of a widely expected interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline is linked to falling Treasury yields, with the 10-year Treasury note, a key benchmark, dropping a quarter point in just one week. The narrowing spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields suggests a favorable trend for homebuyers, as the market appears to be preemptively reacting to the Fed's anticipated monetary policy adjustment aimed at stimulating the economy.

          <p>Dr. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, observes that historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are seeing a surge in applications during the Trump era. She attributes this trend to Black students seeking affirming educational environments "where their history isn’t being erased," in response to a broader political climate attacking diversity initiatives and historical education. While this increased interest is a positive development for HBCUs, Tatum notes that these institutions face the challenge of providing sufficient financial aid to meet the needs of their growing applicant pools.</p>

          <p>In his book "Raising A Nation," researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should shift their focus from purely economic arguments to a moral one. He contends that framing child care simply as a service that allows parents to work is insufficient and that it should be presented as a fundamental American value, akin to the right to public education. Haspel suggests that a more compelling case can be made by highlighting its broader benefits for family well-being, community stability, and even national security, which could build widespread support for transformative policy change.</p>
