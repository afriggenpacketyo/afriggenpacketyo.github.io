While comparable sales decreased by 1.7% year-over-year due to weather impacts, the company noted growth in online sales and among home professionals. Lowe's expects comparable sales to be flat to up 1% year over year and earnings per share to range from approximately $12.15 to $12.40.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners seeking to restrict public access. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public the right to access the commons for open-air recreation, a right the judges said includes camping. This decision is expected to fuel further debate regarding public access to land in England. The Dartmoor National Park Association expressed delight at the ruling, emphasizing the importance of responsible access and respect for landowners and farmers.</p>
