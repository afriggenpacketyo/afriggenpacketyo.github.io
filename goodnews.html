          <p>The National Park Service is issuing strong warnings for visitors to refrain from feeding black bears, citing a recent increase in such incidents, particularly in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Officials emphasize that feeding bears is not only illegal, with penalties up to $5,000, but also dangerous, as it can lead to bears becoming conditioned to human food and more aggressive. This habituation ultimately endangers both visitors and the bears themselves, which may need to be euthanized if they become a threat to public safety.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presenting a valuable opportunity for savers, with top accounts offering interest rates that exceed the rate of inflation. The article notes that online banks typically provide the most competitive rates, especially for short-term CDs, due to a phenomenon known as an inverted yield curve. Financial experts suggest that savers can lock in these high returns to protect their money’s buying power, making CDs a safe and effective savings vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold continues to be a key indicator for investors, currently trading at $3,360.37 per ounce amidst a complex global economic landscape. The article explains that gold's value is influenced by multiple factors, including supply and demand, inflation rates, central bank policies, and geopolitical instability. Often considered a safe-haven asset, gold's price tends to rise during times of uncertainty as investors seek to hedge against currency devaluation and market volatility, reinforcing its historical role as a store of value.

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 12-year-old student from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for her invention designed to help the homeless. She conceived of a solar-powered blanket that charges during the day to provide warmth at night, an idea which an engineering firm then developed into a working prototype. This innovative and compassionate project not only won a national competition but has also resulted in 35 units being distributed to a local homeless charity, showcasing a powerful example of youth-led social impact.</p>
