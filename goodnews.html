          <p>A potential acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery by the newly formed Paramount Skydance would create a media giant with an unparalleled portfolio of content and sports rights. The merger would combine Paramount's franchises like "Star Trek" and exclusive UFC rights with Warner's assets, which include DC superheroes, "Game of Thrones," and broadcast rights for the NHL and MLB. Such a consolidation would significantly bolster its competitive position against rivals like Disney. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a weather-disrupted first round at the BMW PGA Championship, English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick experienced a strange turn of events that he believes ultimately helped his score. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes, he believes his ball was stolen by two spectators. When play resumed, this allowed him to take a penalty drop rather than play his provisional ball, a situation Fitzpatrick called "a good result" that likely saved him a stroke.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, with the average 30-year fixed rate dropping to 6.35%, its lowest level in nearly a year. The decline is attributed to a cooling 10-year Treasury yield and widespread market expectation that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week. This downward trend may provide a window of opportunity for prospective homebuyers and homeowners considering a refinance. (not investment advice)</p>
