        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains the role of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency that analyzes the budgetary impacts of proposed legislation. Republicans have criticized the CBO's projection that their signature legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective information, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. While CBO cost estimates are advisory and don't make policy recommendations, critics on both sides of the aisle have questioned the agency's accuracy, but many defend its nonpartisanship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's AI strategy is under scrutiny as its initial response to generative AI, Apple Intelligence, has been underwhelming compared to competitors like OpenAI and Google. Investors are urging Apple to make significant strides in AI, especially after executives suggested AI could replace the iPhone in the future. The rollout of Apple Intelligence features has been rocky, with delays and the removal of a text summarization tool due to inaccuracies. The company is also facing class-action suits from customers who claim they were misled into buying new iPhones based on advertised AI features, and its best chance to quickly catch up may be to acquire a company, and turn it into a killer feature.</p>

          <p>England secured a 21-run victory against the West Indies in the first T20 international match held in Chester-le-Street. Liam Dawson marked his return to international cricket with four wickets, while Jos Buttler contributed a superb 96 runs. England successfully defended a total of 189, with the West Indies collapsing from 91-2 to 115-6 due to Dawson's skillful bowling. This win extends England's successful start under new captain Harry Brook, who replaced Buttler, and the team now aims to clinch the T20 series in the upcoming match in Bristol.</p>

          <p>"We Are Guardians" is a documentary that examines the ongoing deforestation crisis in the Amazon and the efforts of Indigenous people to combat illegal logging and mining. The film follows Mar“´al, a family man from the Arariboia territory, and Puyr Temb√©, an activist working to increase Indigenous women's political representation. It also features perspectives from a logger and a landowner, highlighting the complexities of the issue. While the documentary effectively underscores the problem and the push-back efforts, it is more of a highlighting of issues than a documentary journey.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the author's experience at Harvard with President Trump's view of the institution. Growing up in West Germany, the author viewed Harvard as a symbol of high-level knowledge and academic excellence. Invited as a visiting scholar, the author experienced Harvard's mission to bridge differences through academic inquiry, transcending politics and culture. The Trump administration's attempts to eliminate visa programs threaten Harvard's ability to maintain its international academic community, and the reality of Harvard is far from Trump's perception.</p>

Despite his success, Cuco remains grounded and appreciative of his fans, the "Cuco Puffs," who supported him from his early days on Soundcloud. His latest album reflects his artistic growth, blending classic sounds with his unique psychedelic style, and the night was a celebration of both his music and heritage.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, has invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the upcoming G7 summit in Alberta, signaling a potential thaw in strained Canada-India relations. Relations between the two countries deteriorated after former PM Justin Trudeau accused India of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil. While India strongly rejected the allegations, the invitation to the G7 summit suggests a willingness to re-engage in dialogue. The decision has been condemned by some members of Canada's Sikh community, who view it as a betrayal.</p>
