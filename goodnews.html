          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol has acknowledged the company was "mismanaged for a couple of years" and is now implementing a new "green apron service model" to drive a turnaround. The strategy focuses on enhancing hospitality and efficiency, featuring a "smart queue" to reduce order times and encouraging more personalized customer interactions. This plan is part of Niccol's broader "Back to Starbucks" initiative, aimed at reversing a trend of falling same-store sales. Analysts express confidence in Niccol's strategy, citing his successful turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell as evidence of his ability to reinvigorate the brand.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lesser-known consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages, the "95% rule," offers significant relief to heirs wishing to retain a family home. This rule stipulates that if the loan balance exceeds the home's market value, heirs can settle the debt by paying 95% of the property's current appraised value, with the FHA's mortgage insurance covering the difference. This provision provides peace of mind for senior homeowners, ensuring their families won't be burdened with a debt greater than the home's worth. The rule makes estate planning more predictable and reduces the risk of foreclosure for heirs who want to keep the property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of four spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting booked in four separate matches to influence betting markets and faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While cleared of the main charges, the commission found him guilty on two counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation, with a sanction for those breaches to be decided later. Paqueta expressed his relief, having maintained his innocence throughout the ordeal that reportedly cost him a major transfer.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they take significant steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. He threatened to use "every tool in our arsenal" if they fail to comply, urging them to offer medicines to Medicaid patients at the lowest price available in other developed nations. This move revives his "most favored nation" policy, aiming to align U.S. drug costs with lower international prices. The president's demands include guaranteeing these lower prices for all new drugs and creating models that sell directly to consumers to eliminate middlemen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension for reaching a comprehensive trade deal with Mexico, maintaining the current tariff structure during the negotiation period. The decision came after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with Trump citing the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship, particularly concerning the border. During this extension, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on fentanyl, cars, and a 50% tariff on certain metals. The move provides temporary stability but keeps the pressure on Mexico to finalize an agreement while other countries face a looming deadline for punitive import duties.</p>

          <p>In the first round of the Women's Open at Royal Porthcawl, Japanese golfers Eri Okayama and Rio Takeda share the lead with a score of five-under-par 67. English favorite Lottie Woad, playing in just her second professional tournament, finished with a level-par 72, placing her five shots behind the leaders. Despite a mixed round with several bogeys, Woad managed to stay in contention with key birdies, including one on the final hole. Other notable players like world number one Nelly Korda shot a solid two-under 70, while defending champion Lydia Ko finished at one over par.</p>

          <p>Amazon is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with investors keenly focused on the impacts of U.S. tariff policies and the company's investments in artificial intelligence. Analysts are watching to see if tariff concerns have dampened consumer demand, though some believe Amazon may have gained market share from Chinese e-commerce rivals affected by new duties. Another key area is the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has faced capacity constraints despite a pledge to spend up to $100 billion on AI-related infrastructure. The report will provide insight into how the tech giant is navigating economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pre-retirees considering their financial strategy amid economic uncertainty may be weighing the option of rolling over their 401(k) into an annuity. Annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, offering a buffer against inflation and market volatility, and current high interest rates make their payout rates attractive. However, this move comes with trade-offs, including high fees, surrender charges, and limited liquidity, which can restrict access to funds and limit growth potential. The decision should be based on individual retirement needs, risk tolerance, and timeline, with experts suggesting a partial rollover might offer a balance of security and flexibility.

However, Brazil also moved to increase the import tariff for EV kits to 35% by January 2027, earlier than planned.

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, in a rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia, which is believed to be the nation's heaviest insect. The creature measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered high in the canopies of the remote Wet Tropics region, a habitat that likely contributed to it remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an adaptation to the colder, high-altitude conditions, and its distinctive eggs helped confirm it as a new species.</p>

Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the withdrawal as a "win for Los Angeles," while Newsom's office stated that the president's "political theater backfired," as the troops had little to do once protests subsided.
