          <p>Aravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, stated that the company's new AI-powered browser, Comet, can significantly boost worker productivity, potentially eliminating the need for companies to hire more staff. He suggested the productivity gains could be worth $10,000 annually per user and contribute trillions to GDP growth. While some, like Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, see potential for economic benefit, they also caution against over-investment in AI infrastructure, highlighting a bubble risk amid massive spending by tech giants. The browser, previously available to paid subscribers, is now free for public use worldwide.</p>

          <p>Super Bowl-winning coach Bruce Arians has publicly questioned why Cleveland Browns' third-string quarterback, Shedeur Sanders, is receiving media interviews, suggesting it's purely for "media clicks." This follows a viral clip where Sanders pantomimed an interview, seemingly in response to criticism from former coach Rex Ryan. Arians argued that Sanders, who has not yet proven himself on the field, should not be available to the press, especially during a week where the team is transitioning to a new starting quarterback. He advised Sanders to focus on practicing hard and being prepared for when his opportunity comes.</p>

          <p>Shares for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis saw a significant increase following reports that the Trump administration is considering tariff relief for vehicles produced in the United States. The proposed changes could eliminate many of the costs incurred from the 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, which has been a major financial burden on the auto industry. According to Republican Senator Bernie Moreno, the plan would reward companies for final assembly in the U.S., potentially benefiting both domestic and foreign automakers with major American operations. The industry has been actively lobbying for such relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Portland, Oregon, are pushing back against President Trump's characterization of their city as a "war zone" by showcasing its tranquil and vibrant aspects on social media. Despite Trump's claims of widespread unrest and his order to deploy National Guard troops, locals are posting videos of scenic trails, thriving businesses, and peaceful daily life. Many business owners and residents express frustration, stating that the president's portrayal is "100% false" and that the real disturbance comes from military helicopters overhead. Protesters are using humor and peaceful tactics to counter the narrative and avoid escalating tensions.</p>

          <p>The estate of the late singer George Michael has given its enthusiastic approval to Taylor Swift for her new song, "Father Figure," which incorporates an interpolation of Michael's 1987 hit of the same name. In a statement, the estate expressed that they had "no hesitation" in agreeing to the association between the two artists, believing Michael would have felt the same. Swift's track, featured on her new album "The Life of a Showgirl," explores the complex dynamic of a mentor-protégé relationship. The lyrics have fueled speculation among fans that they may refer to her past professional relationship with music executive Scott Borchetta.</p>

          <h2>With Official Jobs Report Delayed by Shutdown, Alternative Data Suggests a Stable Labor Market</h2>

          <p>The federal government shutdown prevented the release of the official September jobs report, but alternative high-frequency data suggests the labor market remained relatively stable. Economists had forecasted a modest growth of 51,000 nonfarm payrolls and a steady unemployment rate of 4.3%. Data from sources like the Chicago Federal Reserve and job posting sites indicate that while job growth is slow, the market is not collapsing. These alternative metrics show softening conditions and an uneven market, with sectors like healthcare thriving while others lag, but they do not point to an imminent crisis.

          <p>Actress Rose Byrne is receiving critical acclaim for her performance in the film “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You,” where she plays a therapist and mother caring for a severely ill child. In a recent interview, Byrne described the role as walking a "tightrope" between tragedy and dark humor, exploring radical and uncomfortable themes of maternal shame and failure. The film's director, Mary Bronstein, chose Byrne for her beloved status, which helps audiences connect with a character who makes difficult and sometimes cringeworthy choices. Byrne, known for her comedic roles, embraced the dramatic challenge, which has earned her a Silver Bear.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has raised its price target for Amazon, expressing confidence in the company's future despite concerns about slowing growth for its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). While acknowledging AWS may lose market share, analysts believe it can return to over 20% topline growth, citing its strong backlog and partnership with AI startup Anthropic. The report also highlights that investors may be overlooking the significant profit potential of Amazon's advertising business, which is expected to become its highest-margin segment. This analysis contributed to market movements as the S&P 500 hovered near a record close. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Physical Music Formats Like Vinyl Records Are Exempt from US Import Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinyl records, CDs, and cassettes are protected from recent US import tariffs due to a Cold War-era law known as the Berman Amendment. This legislation prevents the regulation of "informational materials," which has shielded the booming vinyl market from price hikes that could have resulted from the Trump administration's rollback of an exemption for low-value imports. The protection is a relief to fans and the music industry, particularly as artists like Taylor Swift drive massive sales with collectible vinyl editions. However, some US-based record manufacturers argue that tariffs would help domestic businesses by making overseas pressing less competitive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $15,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable, though the change is minimal. A 10-year loan at current rates would cost approximately $185 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $145 per month. While these loans offer a more stable, fixed-rate alternative to high-interest personal loans or credit cards, homeowners are advised to compare them with Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). HELOCs currently have lower variable rates that could fall further with future Fed cuts, potentially offering better long-term value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise Most Retirees to Consider Supplemental Coverage to Fill Gaps in Original Medicare</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Original Medicare covers many healthcare costs for retirees, it leaves significant gaps, such as deductibles and a 20% coinsurance, with no out-of-pocket maximum. This can lead to unpredictable and substantial medical bills, especially for those with chronic conditions or major health events. Consequently, most experts recommend that retirees purchase Medicare supplemental coverage, also known as Medigap, to manage these costs and provide financial stability. While these private plans have monthly premiums, they offer predictable expenses and broader provider flexibility compared to Medicare Advantage plans, which often have network restrictions.</p>
