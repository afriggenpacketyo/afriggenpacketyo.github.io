Zhao, becoming the second Asian player to reach the final, demonstrated exceptional skill and temperament, compiling significant breaks to overcome O'Sullivan's attempts to rally. O'Sullivan acknowledged Zhao's superior play, admitting he "never gave him a game," and cited his own struggles with his cue as contributing to his performance.

          <p>The U.S. Army is organizing a large-scale parade in Washington, D.C., scheduled for June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade is expected to include approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The event has sparked speculation about Trump's influence, reminiscent of his previous attempts to hold a grand military parade.

          <p>The Three Brothers Diner in Danbury, Connecticut, a family-run business for 50 years, is facing economic uncertainty due to declining consumer sentiment. Owner Stanley Kallivrousis has observed a decrease in customer traffic and changes in eating habits, with people sharing meals and taking leftovers home. Despite these challenges, the diner remains a community hub, supported by loyal customers. While the price of food has remained steady, Kallivrousis has paused expansion plans, and some cooks have left for more flexible work in the gig economy.</p>

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is launching a device called the Orb in the U.S. to verify human identity amid the rise of bots and AI. The Orb scans a person's retina to create a digital ID, distinguishing them from AI programs. The startup, World, aims to address issues like bots impersonating people in finance and online dating. Concerns about privacy have arisen, but World claims the Orb doesn't store biometric data and that the data is stored on the user's device.</p>

          <p>A review of the remake of Fran√ßoise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" notes that while the film captures the dreamy seaside setting and attractive cast, it suffers from an over-intellectualization of motive, which undercuts the narrative's briskness. The director's effort to dig deeper into the characters' circumstances results in dialogue that feels clinical rather than revelatory. Chlo√´ Sevigny's performance is praised for embodying emotional susceptibility, but overall, the film's turmoil is not fully felt despite its well-made nature.</p>
