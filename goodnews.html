          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition after undergoing a craniotomy following his IBF minimumweight title match. Shigeoka lost a split decision to Filipino champion Pedro Taduran and suffered a right subdural hematoma, leading to the surgery. Due to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will have to retire from the sport because boxers who have had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license. His gym has received many messages of support from around the country, and Shigeoka is currently recovering in the hospital.</p>

          <p>France is set to ban smoking in numerous outdoor public spaces starting July 1, including beaches, parks, gardens, bus stops, and areas near schools. Violators could face fines up to $153, with enforcement primarily handled by regular police and public self-regulation. The ban excludes outdoor caf√© seating areas, preserving the French tradition of enjoying a cigarette with coffee. This move expands existing anti-smoking laws, aiming to reduce tobacco-related illnesses, which cause over 75,000 deaths annually in France, and the government hopes to continue to see declines in daily smoking.</p>
