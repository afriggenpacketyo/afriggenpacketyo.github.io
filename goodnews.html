          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix, setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history with a time of one minute and 18.792 seconds. He narrowly beat McLaren's Lando Norris, who had briefly held the top spot, by just 0.077 seconds. Verstappen's performance, at an average speed of over 164 mph, surprised even himself after he had struggled for pace during practice sessions. The result sets the stage for a competitive race, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri starting third.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former senior aides and political allies, has been established to oversee the project, which aims to be a center for history, learning, and civic engagement. While Biden has deep roots in Pennsylvania, Delaware was selected as the state that launched and sustained his extensive political career. The fundraising effort for the library faces challenges in a divided political climate, with costs for such projects often running into hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>

          <p>A new conservation chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes National Seashore after a landmark agreement led to the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a five-year ecological restoration project. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants and help native species recover. While the transition is seen as a major environmental opportunity, it has also created tension within the local community over the loss of multigenerational ranches.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in an official Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event many saw as a symbol of growing acceptance within the Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Participants credited the late Pope Francis with fostering a more welcoming tone, a shift from the more rigid stances of his predecessors. While church doctrine has not changed, this official recognition in the Vatican's calendar marks a significant moment of hope and celebration for the community.</p>

          <h2>Schools Nationwide Adopt Locked Pouches to Enforce Classroom Cellphone Bans</h2>

          <p>As numerous states implement rules limiting cellphone use in schools, many districts are turning to Yondr pouches, a lockable case that secures a student's phone during the school day. The system, which requires magnets to unlock the pouches at school entrances, aims to reduce classroom distractions and help students engage more with their learning and peers. While some educators and students report positive changes in the school environment, the solution has been met with mixed reactions, including student attempts to bypass the system and debates over the cost for districts.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its long-running anti-corruption campaign to encompass the financial and stock market sectors, a move an analyst suggests could eventually attract more overseas investment. While the immediate effect on confidence may be muted due to current economic uncertainties, the drive is seen as a step toward cleaner governance. The investigation of high-profile figures within the financial industry aligns with the demands of international institutions for a more transparent and less corrupt market. Over time, this could create a more stable and appealing environment for foreign corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal conflicts. The discovery, described as the "ultimate cold case," has launched a major effort to identify these forgotten soldiers using forensic genealogy. By building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones, researchers have found thousands of living genetic matches and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA samples. This project aims to restore the identities of some of America's first soldiers, who were buried hastily on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second national test of the emergency alert system this Sunday, sending a message to millions of mobile phones. The system is designed to warn the public of life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks.

Officials have stated that users can opt out of the system through their phone's settings, though they are strongly encouraged to remain opted-in for safety reasons.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has presented a detailed plan to the board of PepsiCo, aimed at reaccelerating growth and improving the company's underperforming stock. The plan calls for major strategic shifts, including refranchising the bottling network of its beverage business and divesting from underperforming brands like Quaker. Elliott, which holds a $4 billion stake, argues that these changes will free up capital for reinvestment in iconic brands and restore the company's premium valuation. The proposal emphasizes long-term growth through reinvestment rather than short-term measures like share buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

Joy argues that by renting, she has freed up both capital to invest in the market and the mental energy to focus on growing her businesses, which she credits with accelerating her wealth accumulation more effectively.</p>

          <p>A new book is bringing to light the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document American jazz musicians and their audiences, but it was abandoned after she came under suspicion for leftist politics during the McCarthy era. Her images capture not only the rapture of the audience but also the deep wariness and pain of the musicians, who faced racism and persecution despite their cultural importance. The collection offers a poignant look at a pivotal era in American music.</p>

          <p>Susan Stamberg, a pioneering voice at NPR for over 50 years, is retiring from broadcasting. As the first woman to anchor a daily national evening news program in the U.S., she helped define NPR's distinctive sound and personality when she began co-hosting "All Things Considered" in 1972. Her curious, insightful, and often delightful interviewing style transformed the network from a fledgling operation into a national institution.
