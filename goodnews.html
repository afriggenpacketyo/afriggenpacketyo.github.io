          <h2>India Resists England After Ben Stokes Century in Fourth Test</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the fourth Test at Old Trafford, India mounted a strong resistance against England, closing the fourth day at 174-2. This effort was led by an unbroken 174-run partnership between Shubman Gill and KL Rahul, who defied an English attack missing the bowling of Ben Stokes. Earlier, Stokes had scored his 14th Test hundred, a knock of 141, to help England post a massive total of 669. Despite England remaining favorites to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting six "longevity foods" she wishes were more common in American stores. She was impressed by the incredible variety of traditional Japanese items available in bulk, including a wide selection of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal Japanese produce. The article notes that the store also offered many healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a vast assortment of green tea. The nutritionist emphasized the health benefits of these staples in the Japanese diet.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, and the failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance. Supporters of the recall had criticized the opposition for obstructing key legislation and passing reforms seen as favoring Beijing.</p>

          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after safely navigating the penultimate stage of the race. The overall leader maintained his significant advantage, meaning he will likely secure victory during the final processional stage into Paris. Stage 20 was won by Australian sprinter Kaden Groves, who launched a successful solo attack with 16 kilometers remaining to claim his first-ever Tour stage win. Groves' victory marks a milestone, as he has now won stages in all three of cycling's Grand Tours: the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a España.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has secured pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly outpacing his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris set his fastest time on his first run in the final session, and while Piastri improved on his second lap, a late mistake cost him the top spot. The result sets up an intriguing race, especially with rain forecast for Sunday, which could neutralize the slipstream advantage for the cars starting behind Norris. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, just ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen, who was disappointed with his fourth-place qualifying performance.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant gave him a second chance at life. Years earlier, a routine pre-surgery X-ray incidentally revealed he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal lung disease, despite him having no symptoms. After medications failed and his lung function degraded, doctors gave him less than a year to live but offered the transplant as a final, curative option. Now recovering with 98% lung capacity, Kennedy is back to training therapy dogs, naming his next puppy "Encore" to celebrate his new lease on life.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, U.S. President Donald Trump is keen to visit China this autumn, though a previously rumored September trip is off the table. Beijing and Washington are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November. The trip could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, which is scheduled to be held in South Korea. This potential high-level engagement follows a recent meeting between the U.S. and Chinese foreign ministers, which was described as a positive and essential step toward a potential presidential summit between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A provision in the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act is encouraging more employers to offer student loan reimbursement benefits to their workers. The law makes the tax exclusion for employer contributions (up to $5,250 annually) a permanent feature, removing uncertainty that had caused some companies to hesitate. With federal loan repayment options narrowing, workplace benefits are becoming an increasingly important lifeline for employees burdened by debt. Companies see these programs as a key tool for attracting and retaining talent, especially recent graduates who are most likely to have significant student loan debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has released a global action plan for artificial intelligence just days after a similar announcement from the U.S., escalating the technological competition between the two nations. At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Premier Li Qiang called for international cooperation and proposed a global AI organization. The plan emphasizes China's "AI plus" strategy to integrate the technology across industries and offers to assist other nations, particularly in the Global South. This move is seen as an effort by China to build a multilateral coalition in contrast to the U.S. approach of building its own camp of allies.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's new song "Daisies" has emerged as a potential "song of the summer," offering a welcome contrast to an otherwise stale pop chart. The song, from his surprise album "Swag," has reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The article argues the album's success stems from its soothing, R&B-influenced, and gauze-wrapped production, which resonates with the current cultural mood more than upbeat party anthems. Departing from his previous pop sound, Bieber's new music is described as downtempo yet detailed, capturing a sense of gentle melancholy that seems to be on trend in a world grappling with widespread stress.</p>
