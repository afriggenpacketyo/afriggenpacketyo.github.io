          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just one 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and vision for creating natural-sounding AI voices. ElevenLabs, which specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning, has since achieved a valuation of $6.6 billion. Reina emphasizes his strategy of investing in founders with deep technical knowledge in pre-seed companies before their industries become popular. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with key stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for high-stakes diplomatic and trade meetings. A central focus will be his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aimed at de-escalating the ongoing trade war. Before departing, Trump also stated he would be 'open' to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019, though US officials have downplayed any current plans for such a summit. The trip includes attending the ASEAN and APEC summits.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers 11-4 in Game 1 of the World Series, fueled by a massive nine-run rally in the sixth inning. The game-changing inning featured a pinch-hit grand slam by Addison Barger, the first in World Series history, which broke the game open. Despite an early 2-0 lead for the Dodgers and a late two-run home run from superstar Shohei Ohtani, Toronto's offensive explosion proved insurmountable. The series continues in Toronto for Game 2, with the Blue Jays taking an early 1-0 lead.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is set to tackle pressing regional security issues, including the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord between the Thai and Cambodian governments. However, diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Myanmar have been largely ineffective, with the bloc divided on how to handle the military junta and its planned elections. The summit will also formally welcome Timor-Leste as the bloc's 11th member.</p>

          <p>On the eve of early voting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed fellow Democrat Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers as reasons for his support. The endorsement is a significant boost for Mamdani, a Democratic socialist assemblyman, and helps unify the Democratic party ahead of the general election. The move comes a day after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, received the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a 'symbolic restart' for diplomatic relations, which have been strained in recent years. While major immediate breakthroughs are not expected, the visit itself is a carefully calibrated move toward de-escalation and rebuilding trust. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time that represented a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations and resulted in a free-trade agreement. The current talks are expected to navigate a more complex geopolitical landscape.</p>
