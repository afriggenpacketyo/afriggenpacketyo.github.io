          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department will increase its presence around synagogues, schools, and community centers as the Jewish High Holy Days commence with Rosh Hashanah. This proactive measure is a response to a notable rise in antisemitic attacks across the nation, aiming to deter crime and provide reassurance to the Jewish community. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass affirmed that antisemitism is unacceptable and thanked the LAPD for its efforts to protect Jewish Angelenos during this significant period. Local institutions like the Wilshire Boulevard Temple have also confirmed their robust security protocols are in place to ensure safe and peaceful holiday observances.</p>

          <p>Arsenal salvaged a 1-1 draw against Manchester City thanks to a dramatic 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli, dealing a blow to both teams' Premier League title hopes. After Erling Haaland gave City an early lead, manager Pep Guardiola employed an unusually defensive 5-5-0 formation in the second half to protect the advantage, a tactic that nearly succeeded. City's possession dropped to a record low for a Guardiola-managed team, but Arsenal's persistence paid off with Martinelli's late goal. The result leaves both clubs trailing league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a significant five-point advantage at the top of the table.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government says is a "no-brainer for growth." The project involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the airport claims the expansion will create jobs and boost the economy, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners. Critics argue the expansion will increase air and noise pollution and undermine the UK's climate change commitments, calling instead for investment in sustainable transport.</p>

          <p>At the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, McLaren driver Lando Norris only managed to gain six points on his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, despite Piastri having an uncharacteristically error-filled weekend. Piastri crashed in qualifying and again in the race, yet Norris could only secure a seventh-place finish. While Norris blamed his qualifying position on a strategic decision to run first on a damp track, team principal Andrea Stella suggested Norris made a misjudgment and failed to deliver on the car's potential. The result highlights a missed opportunity for Norris to significantly close the gap in the Formula 1 World Championship standings.</p>

This achievement surpasses the three MVP wins held by legends Sheryl Swoopes, Lisa Leslie, and Lauren Jackson. In her eighth season, Wilson delivered a dominant performance, finishing in the top five in points, rebounds, blocks, and steals, while leading the league in scoring for the second consecutive year. WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert praised Wilson as a "global icon" and one of the greatest players in the league's history for her leadership and skill.</p>

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series victory over Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, winning the final match by six wickets. Chasing a target of 155, England's victory was anchored by a crucial 55-run innings from Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad. Earlier, England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, effectively restricted Ireland's scoring on a slow pitch. Despite an early injury scare, Cox chose to bat and guided his team to a comfortable win, which was sealed by Tom Banton with 17 balls to spare. The result capped a successful series for the English side under stand-in captain Jacob Bethell.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a half-mile stretch of the iconic Oxford Street, calling it the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The long-term goal is to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The proposal has been met with support from many pedestrians who enjoyed the safer, more relaxed atmosphere. However, it faces opposition from some local councillors and residents who raise concerns about traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>Remarkable footage shared by The Big Cat Project showcases the raw power and ferocity of two Amur tigers as they are released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive predators, a brother and sister pair, snarling and aggressively attacking the doors of their transport cages just before being set free. The tigers had been rehabilitated by the Amur Tiger Center, and the intense footage serves as a potent reminder of their wild nature. Amur tigers are the largest tiger subspecies and are endangered, with conservation efforts focused on protecting them from poaching and habitat loss.</p>

          <p>U.S. runner Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter final at the World Championships in Tokyo with a spectacular finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but unleashed a powerful surge to overtake the field and win in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1,500-meter semifinals earlier in the competition for jostling. He stated after the race that he felt "robbed" in the earlier event and was determined to end the championships on his own terms.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the American team could face pressure from its own home crowd at Bethpage. He pointed to the controversial decision for U.S. players to each receive a $500,000 payment for participating, while European players continue to compete for free. Donald speculated that if the paid American team underperforms, the New York gallery—facing high ticket prices—might turn on them. He emphasized that the European team is motivated by purpose and the tradition of the event, not monetary rewards, and that this shared value is a source of their strength.</p>

          <p>To avoid the production quality issues that have plagued other aircraft manufacturers, China's C919 passenger jet is being assembled in a futuristic "smart factory." This advanced facility utilizes a hybrid network of 5G and time-sensitive networking to connect every tool, robot, and worker on the final assembly line. According to a recent study, this integrated system unifies data collection, communication, and control into a single intelligent loop. The goal of this high-tech approach is to create a seamless and error-proof manufacturing process, ensuring that no oversight, like a missing bolt, can slip through the cracks of manual inspection.</p>
