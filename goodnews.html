          <h2>Reform Party's Local Election Triumph Reflects Brexit Divide and Discontent with Major Parties</h2>

          <p>According to Sir John Curtice, the Reform party performed exceptionally well in recent local council elections, securing the most votes and seats. The article notes that while their overall vote share was around 31%, their success in key areas indicates a deeper trend. Reform's support is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit and feel left behind by globalization. This presents a challenge for both the Conservatives and Labour, as Reform's appeal cuts across traditional party lines in specific demographics and regions, especially in areas with fewer university graduates and a conservative outlook on immigration.</p>
