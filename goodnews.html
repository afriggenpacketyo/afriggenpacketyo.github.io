The U.S. State Department has been revoking visas of Mexican musicians for playing music that glorifies cartel violence. Grupo Firme said the visas of the band and its team are under "administrative review by the U.S. Embassy." The band has taken steps to distance itself from music glorifying criminal groups, announcing it would not sing such music in concerts.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are a pain point, but they never get downsized, and while corporate cheerleaders want you to think buzzwords create a culture of inclusion, studies have shown that using jargon impedes trust. Employees who feel like they're lower-status tend to use more jargon. There's jargon that won't die, like "synergy," but new words buzz all the time. Buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are ‚Äî metaphors.

Parenting is an area of adult life where it really is okay to follow a hunch and do what feels right. Any culture that has survived more than a couple of hundred years has robust child-rearing traditions. Children learn best when they are happy and relaxed, and engaged in playful activities with people who care about them.</p>

Her initial concerns about female-led comedies potentially limiting opportunities for other women prompted her to create 'Catastrophe' with Rob Delaney.
