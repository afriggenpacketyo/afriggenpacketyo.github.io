          <h2>England to Extend Free School Meals to Additional Students by 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 04:05:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government in England plans to extend free school meals to an additional 500,000 pupils by September 2026, regardless of their parents' income under Universal Credit. This initiative aims to alleviate financial burdens on families and potentially lift 100,000 children out of poverty, saving parents approximately ¬£500 annually. While the Education Secretary acknowledges the two-child benefit cap is under review, the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests alternative measures might be more cost-effective in reducing child poverty. The education sector and anti-poverty organizations have largely welcomed the announcement, though some advocate for more comprehensive action, including auto-enrollment for eligible children. The government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund this change until 2029, along with ¬£13 million for food charities. The optimism score is a reflection of the positive impact this will have on the families who need it most.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. Weight-loss jabs may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese individuals, due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to conceive. Concerns have been raised about the safe use of these drugs amid their growing popularity, with many women potentially not receiving adequate advice.</p>

The evacuation included homes, hotels, schools, a hospital, and transportation hubs, with authorities ensuring the area was clear before the defusal operation.
