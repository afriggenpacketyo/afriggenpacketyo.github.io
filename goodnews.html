          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers with significant funds can choose between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts for reliable growth. This article compares the potential interest earned on a $50,000 deposit in both account types over different terms, highlighting the trade-offs involved. While CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed return, high-yield savings accounts provide more flexibility but have variable rates that can change with market conditions. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and risk tolerance for interest rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, has been successfully rescued after surviving for nine days while lost in a remote region of British Columbia, Canada. Barber utilized his wilderness knowledge to build a shelter from moss and sticks and drank pond water to survive. He also created distress signals, including carving "HELP" on a rock and drawing an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. He was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data for July, policy experts are projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025 and is in line with the 20-year average. The official COLA is calculated based on the average inflation rate for July, August, and September, so the final figure could change. The calculation uses a specific inflation measure, the CPI-W, which rose 2.5% over the last 12 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has stated in a recent interview that he is actively trying to move away from his public image as a "party guy." The 35-year-old football star, whose profile has risen due to his relationship with Taylor Swift, explained that he wants to be more strategic about his public portrayal. He clarified that while he enjoys attending events with Swift, his focus is on enjoying unique experiences rather than just partying. Kelce emphasized his desire to be respected for his work and to leave a positive legacy, values he says he shares with Swift.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million in its first quarterly earnings since going public. The growth was driven by a 90% increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin, which now stands at $61.3 billion. Despite the strong revenue, the company posted a net loss due to non-cash charges related to its IPO. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed the positive market sentiment to growing recognition that stablecoins and blockchains are foundational to the future of the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Paraguay Considers Local Assembly of Chinese Goods Amid Global Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Paraguayan officials are proposing a new law to allow for the local assembly of electronic goods using imported parts, primarily from China. The plan aims to create jobs and diversify the economy by shifting from importing fully assembled products to manufacturing them domestically under a "Made in Paraguay" label. Ministers argue that current global trade tensions, including U.S. tariffs on Chinese and Brazilian goods, create a unique opportunity for Paraguay to become an attractive assembly hub. The proposal is being debated as the country also considers its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan versus mainland China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages offer a way for homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, providing a potential income boost in retirement. While most of these loans are federally regulated and insured, they are not without risks. Homeowners must continue to pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failure to do so can lead to default and foreclosure. The loan's balance grows over time, which can significantly deplete the equity left for heirs, making it a complex financial decision that requires careful long-term planning.

          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made an unsolicited bid to acquire Google's Chrome browser for $34.5 billion. The offer comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested that Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal, which is higher than the startup's own valuation. Google has previously called the DOJ's divestiture proposal a "radical interventionist agenda" and has not yet commented on Perplexity's offer.</p>
