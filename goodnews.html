          <p>A new Pew Research Center study indicates that Islam is the fastest-growing religion globally, primarily due to natural demographic growth. While Christianity also grew, it declined as a percentage of the world's population, remaining the largest religion with 2.3 billion believers. The study analyzed data from 201 countries, examining religious affiliations, fertility rates, mortality rates, and age distribution to measure demographic changes. The religiously unaffiliated population is now the third-largest group, particularly in Europe and North America, where many raised Christian no longer identify with any religion.</p>
