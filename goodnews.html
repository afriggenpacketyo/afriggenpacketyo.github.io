        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift towards public ownership. The initial nationalized service departed from Woking to London Waterloo on schedule. While the government heralds this as a "new dawn for rail," they are tempering expectations regarding immediate fare reductions, prioritizing service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment. Concerns have been raised by unions about potential outsourcing of security and cleaning, while the Conservatives are urging Labour to fulfill their promises for the railway system. The first service featured the new GBR livery, signaling integration into Great British Railways. </p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China concerning electric vehicles, which has sparked a debate on whether to embrace Chinese investment in the sector. Chinese company Windrose Technology is planning to establish a ‚Ç¨175 million factory in northern France, with ambitious goals to produce 4,000 electric lorries annually by 2027. While some view Chinese investment as a potential job creator, others fear it could undermine the European EV industry. The founder of Windrose is optimistic about bringing the whole ecosystem to France, with plans to list the company on a U.S. stock exchange and potentially a secondary listing in France. </p>

          <p>A virologist from the University of Nottingham is advising the public to remain calm despite the recent detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, marking the first time the virus has been found in the country. While acknowledging that mosquito-borne diseases are likely to increase in range due to climate change, the expert emphasizes that the risk to the general public is low. Surveillance projects are underway to monitor mosquito activity, and precautions such as covering up and using insecticide are recommended to avoid bites. The expert suggests that the discovery of West Nile virus in Nottinghamshire is something to be aware of but not overly concerned about. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching is anticipated to occur after the All-Star break, according to manager Dave Roberts. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters in a simulated game for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. Given the need to gradually build up a starter's endurance, Roberts believes it is unlikely Ohtani will pitch before the break. The Dodgers initially considered an earlier return, but prioritized his hitting during spring training. </p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu, California, has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend after being closed due to the Palisades Fire in January. The closure had isolated Malibu, but the reopening marks a step towards recovery, though charred landscapes and debris remain visible. While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful for a boost in the summer season. The reopening signifies progress in the community's healing process. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 23:56:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has issued an apology for inaccurately describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study materials. The company corrected the inaccurate phrasing and removed the lesson video after facing strong public criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. The incident highlights the importance of accurate information in educational resources and the sensitivity surrounding the Minamata mercury-poisoning disease. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning. </p>
