          <p>Some Chinese academics are pushing for a reevaluation of World War II history, suggesting that the start date should be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. They argue that the current Western-centric view diminishes China's significant role in fighting against fascism. This proposal comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. The article states that Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, further highlighting China's involvement in the war.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an AI-generated likeness of Christopher Pelkey, a man killed in a road rage incident, during the sentencing of his killer. The video, featuring a digitally recreated version of Pelkey delivering a message of forgiveness, impressed the judge, who gave the maximum sentence. While some legal experts raised concerns about the potential for manipulation and emotional influence, others argued that the use of AI was appropriate in the sentencing phase.
