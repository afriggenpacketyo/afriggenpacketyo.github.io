          <p>Larry Pickett Jr., a sophomore and football player at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is being hailed as a hero for his role in a dramatic roadside rescue. He and his father pulled an injured driver from a crashed car just moments before it was engulfed in flames in Orange County, New York. The driver had struck a utility pole, and the Pickett family came upon the scene while driving to campus. Video of the rescue shows them navigating downed power lines to save the man, who reportedly sustained only minor injuries.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has completed a significant deadline-day signing, bringing in French striker Randal Kolo Muani from Paris St-Germain on a season-long loan. The 26-year-old forward, who has been a target for several Premier League clubs, adds a new dimension to Spurs' attack as they prepare for a return to the Champions League. Kolo Muani is known for his versatility, technical skill, and goal-scoring record at previous clubs like Eintracht Frankfurt and Juventus. His arrival provides valuable depth and a different stylistic option to complement Tottenham's existing forwards.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's attempt to sign Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi on the final day of the transfer window has collapsed despite the clubs agreeing on a fee of at least £35 million. The deal fell through because Crystal Palace was unable to secure a suitable replacement for the 25-year-old captain before the deadline. Guehi had been a key defensive target for Liverpool, which was looking to strengthen its backline after some early-season vulnerabilities. The failure to complete the signing marks a significant setback for Liverpool's transfer plans on a busy deadline day.</p>

To qualify, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in Omani property, bonds, or businesses that create local employment. This initiative is part of a broader trend where countries compete to attract wealthy individuals seeking financial security and greater mobility. Proponents suggest such programs offer an "insurance policy against uncertainty" and signal the region's growing integration into the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film 'The Smashing Machine,' directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. Based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, the movie explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is noted as a physical fit for the role, supported by Emily Blunt as his girlfriend, Dawn. While the film effectively portrays Kerr's moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore the emotional depth of his relationships.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has confirmed the departures of two of its high-profile attackers, Rasmus Hojlund and Antony, who failed to make a significant impact at the club. Hojlund has joined Italian champions Napoli on a season-long loan, which includes a £38 million obligation to buy. Meanwhile, Antony has completed a permanent £21.65 million move to Spanish club Real Betis, where he had a successful loan spell last season. These transfers represent a significant financial loss for United on players who were acquired for much larger fees.</p>

          <p>The Texas-based convenience store chain Buc-ee's has evolved into a cultural phenomenon and a must-visit destination for American travelers.

Brand experts describe Buc-ee's as the "Disneyland of the convenience store industry," emphasizing its focus on creating a joyful and overwhelming sensory experience. The company's success is attributed to a simple formula of friendliness, cleanliness, and keeping products in stock, turning a simple pit stop into a memorable part of the journey.</p>

          <p>An article examines and debunks long-standing, unfounded claims circulating on social media that former First Lady Melania Trump worked as an escort before meeting her husband. These allegations, which first gained prominence in 2016, led to successful defamation lawsuits against the Daily Mail and a blogger, both of whom retracted their stories and paid damages. The article also refutes the related claim that the Trumps met at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell, citing multiple sources that state they were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli. The analysis concludes there is no credible evidence to support these viral assertions.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has finalized his team for the upcoming match at Bethpage, warning the US team not to expect a simple "rinse and repeat" of Europe's victory in Rome. The team features 11 of the 12 players from the 2023 winning squad, including wildcard picks Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm. Despite the continuity, Donald stressed that playing on American soil presents a different challenge that will require a new strategy and different player pairings. He urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story in protest of a new book ban policy in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has resulted in the removal of her iconic novel, 'The Handmaid's Tale,' from some schools. Her new story satirizes the directive by describing "very, very good children" who grow up without any biological realities. This act of creative protest highlights the growing controversy over book bans in Canada, a trend that has migrated from the United States.</p>

          <p>European stock markets started the month on a positive note, with the defense sector showing significant gains. The rally was largely driven by the announcement of a £10 billion warship export deal between the United Kingdom and Norway, the UK's largest ever by value. Shares of BAE Systems, the builder of the warships, rose alongside other defense firms. The health-care sector also contributed to the upward trend, with Novo Nordisk shares climbing after releasing favorable trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity caused the body sizes of wild and domestic species to evolve in opposite directions starting in the Middle Ages. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding for agricultural purposes. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

Both leaders emphasized their "special and privileged" partnership, discussing regional stability and trade.

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national train operator, has launched a trial program eliminating peak-time fares, meaning passengers no longer have to pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is a response to post-pandemic shifts in travel patterns, with officials noting that there is now sufficient capacity on the network to accommodate more passengers during these times. This initiative has sparked a debate about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on whether it would lead to overcrowding on busy routes.</p>
