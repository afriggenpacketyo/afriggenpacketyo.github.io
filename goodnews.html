          <p>President Trump announced plans for a comprehensive missile defense system, dubbed the ‚ÄúGolden Dome,‚Äù aimed at protecting the United States from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats. The project, a priority since Trump took office, seeks to create a system similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome but faces significant logistical and financial challenges. While Trump estimates the cost at $175 billion, the Congressional Budget Office suggests it could range from $161 billion to $542 billion. General Michael Guetlein of the Space Force will oversee the project, which aims to be fully operational before the end of Trump's term.</p>

          <p>Chengdu, an inland city in southwestern China, is experiencing a surge in population and a booming real estate market as young people turn away from the hypercompetitive work culture of coastal megacities. Known as ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs happiest city,‚Äù Chengdu offers a more relaxed lifestyle with a vibrant arts scene, LGBTQ community, and lower cost of living. While jobs in Chengdu may pay less, the city's affordability and cultural attractions are drawing transplants and returnees, leading to increased housing prices. Chengdu's economy, driven by the service sector and entertainment industry, is relatively insulated from the trade war with the United States.</p>

          <p>Veterinary students are in high demand due to a shortage of professionals caused by high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership. California shelters are facing a lack of animal medical care, leading to overcrowding and euthanasia. Despite the demand, veterinary students face significant tuition costs, leading to large student debt, and the profession is known for high suicide rates due to the emotional toll of caring for animals and dealing with pet owners.

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out large bonuses to senior executives linked with securing its ¬£3bn rescue loan, following criticism over its performance. The company had been accused of trying to circumvent rules to ban water companies from paying bonuses. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, which could have led to them getting ¬£1m on top of their annual salaries and regular bonuses. Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable".</p>
