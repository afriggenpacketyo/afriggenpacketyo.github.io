          <h2>US and China Report Progress in Trade Talks, Details to Follow</h2>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made 'substantial progress' in de-escalating the trade war after high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. These discussions, the first since President Trump levied steep tariffs in January, have sparked optimism for a potential trade truce that could lift financial markets and ease global economic concerns. While details remain undisclosed until Monday, both sides have hinted at a willingness to lower tariffs, which currently stand at 145% on Chinese imports and 125% on some US goods, disrupting global supply chains. The article notes that Washington would not lower tariffs unilaterally, and China would need to make its own concessions.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's recent BBC interview expressing a desire to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has reignited attention on the ongoing rift within the royal family. This has overshadowed King Charles's public engagements, including marking the 80th anniversary of V-E Day and preparing for a trip to Canada. The palace has pushed back against Harry's claims regarding his security arrangements in Britain, and the article suggests that resolving this family division could be crucial for King Charles's reign and the monarchy's image. Prince William is taking on a more prominent public role amid his father's illness and the estrangement of Prince Harry.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the United States and China made 'substantial progress' in trade talks held in Geneva, with details expected to be released soon. This development offers hope for easing tensions in the global economy, which has been strained by tariffs imposed by both countries. While the specifics of any agreement remain unclear, it signals a potential de-escalation of the trade war initiated by President Trump, who has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax.</p>

          <p>The US and Iran have completed a fourth round of talks in Oman regarding Tehran's nuclear program, with both sides agreeing to meet again in the near future. US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff described the discussions in Muscat as encouraging, while Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called them 'difficult but useful.' The US insists Iran must abandon its uranium enrichment activities, while Iran maintains it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons. Araghchi said the talks were more serious than previous occasions but noted that contradictory positions taken by the US in the media are not acceptable.</p>

          <p>A recent Saturday Night Live sketch featuring Walton Goggins as a waiter excessively flirting with middle-aged mothers has sparked debate about the show's portrayal of motherhood and sexuality. While the sketch aimed to challenge the stereotype that mothers are undesirable, some critics argue that it reinforced the idea that older women are the butt of the joke. Another sketch during Weekend Update further solidified the view that motherhood is antithetical to sexuality, undermining the idea that women's sex lives continue after giving birth. The article suggests that SNL missed an opportunity to offer a more expansive and refreshing view of motherhood.</p>
