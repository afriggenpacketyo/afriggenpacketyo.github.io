          <p>Despite a U.S. port fee aimed at ships connected to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards due to their unmatched competitiveness. MSC's senior vice-president stated that the port fee wouldn't deter them from ordering more vessels from China, emphasizing China's competence and capability in shipbuilding, especially for vessels needed for the energy transition. While acknowledging the U.S.'s efforts to revive its shipbuilding sector, she noted that it would require state subsidies and the retention of strategic assets and would not happen overnight. The International Maritime Organisation wants the global shipping industry to achieve net-zero emissions in the next 25 years or so.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the victory of a horse named Journalism at the Preakness Stakes, highlighting the importance of patience and strategic timing. Journalism, initially trapped on the rail, demonstrated composure and resilience by waiting for an opportunity to advance. After a hard bump, the horse found a narrow opening and surged ahead to win by a half length, proving that victories can be earned through calculated moves rather than reckless speed. Journalism is now headed to the Belmont Stakes, where the horse's performance will be etched into memory.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 points, bringing it to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, where the economy expanded 7.4% year-on-year. However, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, reflecting concerns about a potential slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The RBI had previously highlighted growth concerns amidst the threat of tariffs from the United States, and the rate cut also comes as India's inflation is largely on a downtrend.</p>

          <p>Ayami Sato, a top female baseball player, is making history in Canada as the first woman to play in a professional men's league. The 35-year-old Japanese right-hander debuted as the Toronto Maple Leafs' Opening Day starter, pitching two scoreless innings. Sato has received significant media attention in Canada and has become a fan favorite, but she remains focused on self-improvement rather than proving she can compete with men. Her trailblazing efforts coincide with the exciting development of a new U.S. women's pro league set to launch in 2026, where she will serve as a special advisor.</p>

          <p>North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported that it has successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer after a failed launch in May. The ship is now moored at a pier in the northeastern port of Chongjin, where experts will inspect its hull. Kim Jong Un, who viewed the destroyer as a crucial asset, had previously criticized the failed launch as a "criminal act caused by absolute carelessness," leading to an investigation and the arrest of four officials. The ship is Pyongyang's second known destroyer and is reportedly capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles.</p>

While Japan continues to demand the elimination of the higher tariffs, they are also considering accepting a cut in the rates, as the United States resists a full removal of the duties.

It comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard on Thursday accusing President Donald Trump of waging a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech.

          <p>Elon Musk initially stated that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft due to threats from President Trump to cancel government contracts, but later reversed his decision after a user on X urged him to reconsider. The shift occurred amidst an escalating dispute between Musk and Trump following Musk's criticism of the Republican tax bill. Musk's initial tweet responded to Trump's statement about potentially terminating Musk's governmental subsidies and contracts. The Dragon spacecraft is crucial for transporting crew to and from the International Space Station, and Musk's change of heart followed advice to "cool off and take a step back."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend towards consuming food products with fewer ingredients is emerging, driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods (UPF). More retailers and food brands are offering items with simpler ingredient lists, influenced by the increasing awareness of UPF highlighted by Dr. Chris Van Tulleken's book. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on ingredient count can be misleading, as it may lead to the exclusion of fortified nutrients. This debate underscores the complexities of navigating food choices and the need for a balanced perspective on processed versus unprocessed foods.</p>

          <p>China has tested the core components of quantum-based network technology in space flight to assess their ability to withstand the rigors of space travel. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a Yuanxingzhe-1 rocket to an altitude of 2.5km. The test marks a key step in China's transition towards building a fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC skips the key-sharing step and sends the actual message directly through a quantum channel making the system more efficient and secure.</p>
