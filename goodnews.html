          <p>A significant archaeological finding in China's Qinghai province is providing new insights into the reign of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor to unify China. A researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has analyzed a stone carving found near Zhaling Lake, which is believed to be the only such carving from the emperor's era still at its original site. The inscription details a journey to the source of the Yellow River, which scholars suggest could be linked to the emperor's famed and obsessive quest to find an elixir of immortality.</p>

          <h2>Political Analyst Views Trump's Scotland Trip as an Invaluable Opportunity for UK's Starmer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 20:40:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC political analysis suggests that U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's meeting with President Trump during his private visit to Scotland provided invaluable access and face time with the U.S. leader. Despite the unusual diplomatic setting of Trump's golf courses, the interactions are seen as crucial for strengthening the U.S.-U.K. relationship. The article notes the free-wheeling nature of the discussions, which covered a wide range of topics from Gaza to trade. For Starmer, these moments are seen as key opportunities to align on important issues and navigate the unpredictable style of the Trump presidency.</p>

          <h2>Expert Explains Why Hangovers and Alcohol's Effects Worsen with Age</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 20:31:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A geriatrician and dementia expert explains that the body's ability to process alcohol diminishes significantly with age, leading to more severe effects from drinking. In your 20s, the liver and brain are more resilient, but habits formed then can cause future problems. As people enter their 40s and 50s, health risks like obesity and hypertension increase, and alcohol can exacerbate these conditions, also raising the risk for certain cancers and disrupting sleep. By the 60s, many people lose the enzyme needed to metabolize alcohol effectively, meaning even one drink can feel ill-effects the next day.</p>

          <p>Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in a bid to gain eligibility to play for the USC Trojans this season. After transferring to USC for his final year, the NCAA denied his waiver request and subsequent appeal, citing its rule that athletes have five years to complete four seasons of competition. The lawsuit challenges the legality of this rule, arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury. Wingfield claims the NCAA's decision is costing him a significant NIL opportunity and a chance to enhance his career.</p>

Would-be campers can enter a free drawing for a chance to book a site seven months in advance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that recent major trade deals, including the one with the European Union, failed to spark a market rally because investor focus is currently elsewhere. He argues that Wall Street is preoccupied with this week's Big Tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data, which are seen as more impactful than tariff news. Cramer also points to a sense of "tariff ennui," as investors have grown accustomed to a pattern of high tariff threats followed by negotiated deals, and are waiting for resolutions with other major partners like China, Canada, and Mexico.

Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, has emerged as a potential fit.
