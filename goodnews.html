          <p>Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), is preparing for a leadership election in September, but faces a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Failure to contain the recall challenge could disrupt the KMT's leadership transition and fracture the party. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan signaled his intention to step down and hinted that Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen could be a promising successor. The KMT aims to announce the party chair race in July, hold internal voting in September, and install a new leader by October. </p>
