          <p>Teenage forward Rio Ngumoha is creating considerable buzz among Liverpool supporters following a standout pre-season performance where he scored one goal and assisted another. At just 16 years old, Ngumoha is the club's second-youngest player ever and has consistently impressed throughout the summer friendlies. Given recent changes to Liverpool's attacking options, including the tragic death of Diogo Jota and the sale of another winger, there is growing speculation that the young talent could earn a place in the first-team squad this season.</p>

          <p>Following its $8.4 billion acquisition of Paramount Global, David Ellison's Skydance Media has revealed a new leadership team, signaling a major overhaul of the legacy entertainment company. Ellison will serve as Chairman and CEO, with former NBCUniversal chief Jeff Shell appointed as President. The new structure retains only one current top Paramount executive, with most key positions filled by Skydance veterans and other industry hires. This transition follows a politically contentious FCC approval process for the high-profile merger.</p>

          <p>After a decade of investigation, scientists have identified the cause of a devastating disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast. A new study pinpoints a bacterium, *Vibrio pectenicida*, as the culprit behind the gruesome sea star wasting disease. This breakthrough solves a long-standing marine mystery and provides a crucial foundation for developing conservation strategies to help restore critically endangered starfish populations and the kelp forest ecosystems that depend on them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rapid development of artificial intelligence is fueling a massive construction boom for data centers across the U.S., as tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta dramatically increase their infrastructure spending. An analysis reveals that Northern Virginia and Arizona's Maricopa County are the primary hubs for this growth, which is often incentivized by significant local tax breaks. This unprecedented expansion is also raising serious concerns about the immense environmental impact, particularly the vast consumption of electricity and water by these facilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "60% rule" is a critical regulation affecting seniors who use a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) to access their home's value. This Federal Housing Administration guideline limits borrowers to withdrawing a maximum of 60% of their total available loan amount within the first year. The rule is intended to protect homeowners from rapidly exhausting their equity, but it can create difficulties for those who need a larger lump sum for immediate financial needs, requiring them to wait a full year to access the remaining funds.

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, delaying a response that was scheduled to take effect this week. This pause is intended to create time for both sides to finalize and implement the broader trade agreement reached in late July between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The move is viewed as a de-escalation that aims to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
