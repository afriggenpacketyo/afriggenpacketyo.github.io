          <h2>Self-Managed Abortion Gains Acceptance Amidst Shifting Medical and Political Landscapes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR report explores the increasing acceptance of self-managed medication abortion, a method involving abortion pills without direct doctor supervision, driven by factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The FDA's decision to ease restrictions on mifepristone has expanded access through telehealth, though some states still maintain barriers. Clinicians initially expressed concerns about safety but were swayed by research demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of self-managed abortion. Despite increasing restrictions in some states, self-managed abortion is becoming more widespread, with the World Health Organization recognizing it as a safe method in the first trimester.</p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, highlighted Beijing's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with Central Asian countries. China signed 58 agreements worth nearly $25 billion with regional partners, including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Kazakhstan also announced that China National Nuclear Corporation would lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in the country. While the EU and Russia also maintain interests in the region, these developments indicate China's growing influence in Central Asia.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign male DNA. The San Diego County District Attorney's Office recommended her conviction be overturned due to the new evidence, but initially decided to retry her. However, just as jury selection was about to begin, prosecutors dropped the charges, citing insufficient evidence to prove her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Find Spleen May Play Role in Diabetes Treatment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform the organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. They also found that the spleen could be engineered into a transplant hub with the help of nanoparticles, offering a more promising long-term survival site than the liver. The research suggests that the spleen could become an ideal organ for islet transplantation if safety and effectiveness are demonstrated through clinical studies.</p>
