          <p>West Ham United and England footballer Jarrod Bowen offers a candid reflection on his journey from a four-year-old playing for Leominster Minors to a European trophy winner. He emphasizes the profound impact of his parents and a pivotal youth coach at Hereford, alongside overcoming an early rejection from Cardiff that fueled his appreciation for the game. Bowen also shares the immense joy of his Europa Conference League triumph and the "carnage" of balancing a demanding career with being a new father to twin girls.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a frustrating 3-0 shutout loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks, managing a meager three hits and only one runner in scoring position. This defeat halted their recent four-game winning streak and underscored persistent offensive challenges, especially against a pitcher like Zac Gallen who had been having a dismal season. Starting pitcher Blake Snell struggled with a noticeable drop in fastball velocity, conceding three runs including a crucial two-run home run. This outcome marked a significant missed opportunity for the Dodgers to expand their division lead, as both they and the San Diego Padres failed to capitalize on favorable schedules against lower-ranked opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants within the United States. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the administration's policy likely infringes on individuals' due process rights, arguing that even those who entered illegally are entitled to a fair process under the Fifth Amendment. This decision is a significant setback for President Trump's campaign promise of increased deportations, although it does not question the constitutionality of expedited removal at the border. The ruling emphasizes the necessity of due process for a large group of people not previously subject to such fast-track removals.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Townsend, despite being ranked outside the top 100 in singles, achieved a stunning upset at the US Open, defeating No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 to reach the fourth round. This career-highlight victory follows a controversial period where Townsend publicly addressed alleged "no class" comments from a previous opponent, Jelena Ostapenko, sparking accusations of racism. Townsend stated her stand was "bigger than me," focusing on representation and authenticity within the sport, and has garnered significant public support from figures like Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka. Her resilience is further underscored by past challenges, including a USTA fitness controversy in 2012, making this triumph a powerful statement.</p>

          <p>Britain's Cameron Norrie was defeated by 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the US Open fourth round, marking Norrie's seventh loss against the Serb. Despite briefly taking a lead in the third set, Norrie ultimately lost 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3, ending British singles interest in the tournament. Djokovic, who is aiming for a record 25th major title, overcame a lower back injury during the match, demonstrating his enduring top-level performance. Norrie reflected on being "a little overconfident" but expressed satisfaction with his overall season, having rebounded from a difficult start to the year.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have successfully established a new world record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Their incredible 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was completed in an impressive 139 days, five hours, and 52 minutes, significantly surpassing the previous record of 162 days. Throughout their arduous voyage, the brothers confronted violent tropical storms, including a harrowing incident where Lachlan was swept overboard, and faced the challenge of rationing dwindling supplies. This remarkable feat has also raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar, adding a substantial charitable dimension to their achievement.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile stretch of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures and pavement collapse, further exacerbated by the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides crucial access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding, though fire danger warnings are heightened for the area during the holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, upholding a lower court ruling. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior TPS extension, emphasizing that Congress designed the program to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. This decision offers a significant win for plaintiffs, who argued the administration overstepped its bounds. While the ruling's immediate effect on those whose protections already expired is unclear, it provides a legal path to challenge the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, has gone viral due to her animated responses and a lawyer's questions about her appearance. Cardi B denied attacking Emani Ellis, claiming the guard invaded her privacy and filmed her during a private pregnancy appointment. The trial saw lawyers inquire about her changing hairstyles and nail length, leading to humorous exchanges that some social media users found amusing, while others questioned the relevance and potential racial or misogynistic undertones of the questioning.

          <p>The Pentagon is evaluating ways to accelerate the reinstatement process for former service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Defense Department officials are considering granting honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal, excluding individuals with additional disciplinary issues. This initiative aims to address frustrations among veterans who describe the return-to-service process as slow and arduous. The move follows President Trump's executive order to reinstate these troops, rescinding the Biden-era vaccine mandate, and seeks to offer incentives like duty station preferences and back pay to facilitate their return.</p>
