          <p>Authorities in Spain's Catalonia region lifted an order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes after a fire at an industrial estate released a toxic cloud of chlorine.

Fire services reported no casualties and stabilized the blaze, allowing residents to resume normal activities.

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party claims that the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has withdrawn its classification of the party as "confirmed right-wing extremist," but this is false. The BfV complied with the AfD's request to follow a "standstill commitment," which means that the agency is putting its official reclassification of the AfD as a right-wing extremist party on hold. The classification "confirmed right-wing extremist" was not withdrawn.</p>

          <p>A wayward Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space. The spacecraft, which became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a booster malfunction, splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Cold War-era space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which aimed to explore Venus. While the United States focused on the moon, the Soviets achieved several milestones in Venus exploration, including the first probes to enter its atmosphere and land on its surface.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have stated that she is being drawn into a legal conflict between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to generate "tabloid clickbait." Swift was summoned to a U.S. court after allegations that she encouraged Baldoni to accept script rewrites by Lively for the film *It Ends With Us*, which is the subject of a sexual harassment case. Swift's representatives deny her involvement in any casting or creative decisions related to the film, emphasizing that she never saw an edit or made any notes on the project.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of Schedule I substances and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize Schedule I substances. The bill is simple to enact and would allow research to catch up with the US‚Äôs increasing cannabis consumption.</p>

          <p>The Detroit Opera is staging "The Central Park Five," an opera about the wrongful conviction of five Black and brown teenagers in 1989. The opera includes the character of Donald Trump, who at the time took out full-page ads demanding the death penalty for the accused. The director chose to focus on the story of the Five, rather than Trump, but said that the opera tells an uncomfortable truth about power and race. The opera features a range of American musical idioms, including jazz, blues, bebop, and R&B.</p>
