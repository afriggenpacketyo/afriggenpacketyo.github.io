          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 draw has set up an all-British first-round match between Emma Raducanu and 17-year-old wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, ranked 38th, narrowly missed a seeding and faces a challenging path, potentially meeting 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in the second round and world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third. Two other British teenage wildcards, Hannah Klugman and Mika Stojsavljevic, also received tough draws against seeded opponents Leylah Fernandez and Ashlyn Krueger, respectively.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei stock index closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, driven by easing concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and reduced tensions in the Middle East. The rise was supported by news that the Trump administration might extend a pause on new reciprocal tariffs. The market also saw gains in heavyweight semiconductor stocks, buoyed by optimism for artificial intelligence demand. Despite the four-day rally, some analysts caution that the market's footing remains unstable and may not fully reflect underlying economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing hub of Guangdong province is planning to create a domestic version of the renowned Canton Fair to help its export-focused companies pivot to the internal market. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to enhance China's economic self-reliance amidst weak global demand and trade uncertainties. The plan aims to involve 20,000 export-oriented businesses in promotional events and will include support like fee reductions for setting up online stores on e-commerce platforms.

          <p>Hotels are increasingly dealing with guests exhibiting overly casual behavior, such as walking barefoot in lobbies or wearing pajamas to breakfast. According to a Hotels.com survey, these actions are widely disapproved of by other travelers. Rather than using a heavy-handed approach, many establishments are opting for subtle cues to encourage better decorum. These methods include staff speaking in quieter tones to discourage loud phone calls or providing etiquette guidelines in pre-arrival emails. While some luxury hotels are relaxing traditional standards, others maintain stricter dress codes, especially in specific areas like golf courses.</p>

          <p>NATO members have agreed to more than double their defense spending targets to 5% of GDP by 2035, a move that is expected to benefit space and defense companies. This increased financial commitment is complemented by NATO's new commercial space strategy, which recognizes space as a critical operational domain. The alliance's focus on space capabilities for communication, navigation, and surveillance is creating new opportunities for commercial partners, as evidenced by a recent NATO contract with satellite imagery provider Planet Labs. This shift could also fuel European efforts to develop alternatives to services like SpaceX's Starlink for strategic independence. (not investment advice)</p>

China, which dominates the global supply, had imposed export restrictions on these critical minerals as a retaliatory measure against U.S. tariffs, disrupting supply chains for numerous industries.

This new court, likely based in The Hague, aims to close a legal loophole, as the International Criminal Court (ICC) cannot directly prosecute Russian officials for the decision to wage war. The tribunal will seek to hold high-ranking figures, potentially including President Vladimir Putin, accountable for initiating the conflict. While trials may occur in absentia, the effort is seen as crucial for gathering evidence and setting a precedent for international law.</p>
