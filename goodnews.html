        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, reported strong U.S. sales growth in April, driven by consumer purchases ahead of anticipated price increases due to new tariffs. Over 90 nations, including Japan, advocated for preserving memories of atomic bombings during a U.N. meeting, marking the 80th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan Airlines (JAL) reported record revenues, while Prime Minister Ishiba vowed to protect national interests in ongoing tariff negotiations with the U.S. A rare woodpecker sighting was confirmed on Japan's main island, and a court finalized a ruling for compensation in an asbestosis case.</p>

          <p>Zhao Xintong delivered an impressive performance, establishing a commanding 12-4 lead against Ronnie O'Sullivan in their World Championship semi-final. Zhao secured all eight frames on Friday morning, becoming only the fourth player to achieve an 8-0 session win against O'Sullivan at the Crucible. O'Sullivan, who has openly discussed difficulties with his cue, made changes after Thursday's session, but these adjustments did not yield the desired results. Zhao, competing as an amateur, showcased clinical potting skills, suggesting he could become the first Chinese player to win the title in Sheffield.</p>

The image, captured using an iPhone during a trip to Cumbria earlier this year, was shared on social media channels with a celebratory message. Princess Charlotte is the second child of Prince William and Kate and is third in line to the British throne, so she is still quite young to be so high up in the line of succession.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense and addressing U.S. concerns over rare earth mineral access amid trade disputes with China. The agreement, described as an equal partnership, involves the development of mineral, oil, and gas projects, with the U.S. providing financial or military assistance and Ukraine contributing royalties from future licenses. The deal covers 55 minerals, including rare earth elements, titanium, lithium, and uranium, but excludes resources currently generating revenue for Ukraine. Experts note that Ukraine possesses the workforce and metallurgical expertise to develop these resources, contrasting with the long-term infrastructure development required in places like Greenland.</p>

          <p>With higher education facing threats from the Trump administration, including funding cuts and intervention in admissions and curriculum, David Kirp suggests that universities must unite to defend academic freedom. While Harvard can withstand financial penalties due to its large endowment, other institutions are more vulnerable. Kirp argues that universities should band together, issuing a clear message against assaults on academic freedom and launching a campaign to demonstrate their value to society. Wealthier universities should also support less affluent institutions with legal assistance, creating a ‚ÄúNATO for higher education‚Äù to deter government overreach.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook has been named in the England squad for the upcoming Test against Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge, potentially marking his debut for the national team. The 27-year-old seamer earns his opportunity due to injuries affecting several key players, including Chris Woakes and Mark Wood. Cook joins an inexperienced attack, with Josh Tongue also returning to the squad after nearly two years. The likely combination of Atkinson, Tongue, and Cook in the XI would have only 13 caps between them, the fewest for England's pace attack at home since Zimbabwe's last Test in the country 22 years ago.</p>

          <p>A lynx born in a zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, but this is dependent on the lynx's ability to adapt to the wild. The female lynx was moved to Germany, where it will spend the next few months being monitored in an enclosure to see if it's up to the challenge. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests but efforts are being made to introduce new cats to increase their genetic diversity particularly in central Europe. The key question in relation to the Newquay lynx is likely to be its relationship with humans.</p>
