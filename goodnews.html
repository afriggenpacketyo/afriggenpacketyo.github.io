          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 02:14:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the complicated relationship between birth control pills and women's sex drive, highlighting diverse experiences from women globally. Many reported a significant drop in libido, often without prior medical warning, while some experienced no change or even an increase due to reduced pregnancy anxiety. Research suggests the pill can increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which reduces free testosterone levels, potentially dampening desire. The article also discusses other side effects like vaginal dryness and mood swings, while acknowledging that libido is influenced by multiple factors beyond just the pill, urging for more open dialogue and awareness.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has approved plans for a £2.2bn privately-financed second runway at London Gatwick Airport, aiming to boost economic growth and create thousands of jobs. The project involves repurposing the Northern Runway and expanding terminals, potentially increasing flights to 389,000 annually by the late 2030s. Despite government enthusiasm and support from some Labour figures, the expansion faces strong opposition from climate campaigners and the Green Party, who deem it a "disaster for the climate crisis" due to concerns over pollution and emissions. The article details the conditions and benefits outlined by the airport to address these concerns.</p>

          <p>World Athletics president Sebastian Coe suggests a potential "re-engineering" of the global Olympic sports calendar, particularly for endurance events, due to the increasing challenges posed by climate change. Following the Tokyo World Athletics Championships, where athletes contended with extreme heat and humidity, Coe indicated events like the marathon might need to be held at different times of the year. Research shows 70% of athletes report climate change affecting their training and competition. The sport is otherwise in good shape, with record-breaking performances and plans for a new Ultimate Championships in Budapest, demonstrating a proactive approach to future challenges.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Rep. Adam Smith, held a rare meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing, primarily advocating for increased military-to-military dialogue between the two nations.

Premier Li warmly welcomed the "icebreaking trip," underscoring the profound importance of continued exchanges and cooperation between the world's two most influential countries.

          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs secured their first win of the season, defeating the New York Giants 22-9, after overcoming a notably sluggish and error-prone first half. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes ultimately found his rhythm in the second half, connecting with Tyquan Thornton for a crucial touchdown and setting up another score that changed the game's momentum. Tight end Travis Kelce also refocused his efforts after a visible sideline exchange with Coach Andy Reid, contributing to the team's improved performance. The Chiefs' defense played a pivotal role, holding Giants quarterback Russell Wilson to just 160 passing yards, securing a much-needed victory that moves Kansas City to a 1-2 record.</p>
