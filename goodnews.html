          <p>Comedian Jim Gaffigan humorously suggests expanding Father's Day into a month-long celebration, following Mother's Day. Gaffigan envisions a system where fathers receive presents on even days and enjoy a communication-free 'Ramadad' on odd days. While acknowledging the impracticality of celebrating fathers for 35 consecutive days, he emphasizes the importance of honoring dads. The article is a lighthearted take on the traditional Father's Day holiday, with Gaffigan using his signature wit to explore the concept of a 'Father's Day Month'.</p>

          <p>Li-Young Lee's poem 'Infant Longing' explores themes of loss, connection, and the cyclical nature of life and death. The poem reflects on the speaker's relationship with his mother, who provided sustenance and comfort amidst suffering. The poem uses the image of a kiss to convey the idea of sealing and opening, closing and opening eyes, highlighting the ambiguous nature of love and longing. The speaker questions the difference between these kisses and seeks to understand what comes before the beginning and after the end, finding an infinite longing that moves over the face of the deep.</p>
