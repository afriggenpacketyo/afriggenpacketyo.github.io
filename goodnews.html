          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged nearly 80% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. The potential deal would give the U.S. government direct ownership in a critical mineral supply chain, mirroring a previous investment in rare earth miner MP Materials. The move aims to reduce risk for taxpayers while supporting a project vital to U.S. interests. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During his address to the UN General Assembly, President Trump directed harsh criticism toward Russia for its role in the Ukraine war while adopting a comparatively softer tone on China. He threatened Russia with powerful new tariffs if it does not agree to a peace deal, identifying China and India as primary funders of the conflict through their oil purchases. This focus on Moscow, coupled with his administration's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, has led some observers to suggest Washington may be pulling back from its more confrontational stance toward Beijing. The shift in rhetoric could signal a realignment of U.S. foreign policy priorities.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi has unveiled its new 15T series of smartphones at an international launch event in Munich, signaling a direct challenge to market leader Samsung. The devices are priced competitively while offering high-end specifications, such as advanced camera systems and large displays, positioning them against Samsung's popular A and S series phones. Beyond smartphones, Xiaomi also announced the global launch of its Mijia brand of home appliances, including refrigerators and washing machines. This expansion mirrors Samsung's broad product ecosystem and reflects Xiaomi's ambition to grow its market share in Europe, where it is already the third-largest smartphone vendor.</p>

          <p>Six-time Grand Slam champion Boris Becker has stated that he regrets his historic 1985 Wimbledon victory at the age of 17, citing the immense pressure it created for the rest of his life. He became the youngest men's singles champion ever but found that all his subsequent achievements and personal challenges were measured against that early success. Becker, who recently served time in prison for financial offenses, reflected on how becoming a world sensation as a child made it difficult to mature and find his footing. He believes that while he is happy with his career, winning his first major title at such a young age was ultimately detrimental.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who claimed his 2018 termination for sending anti-Trump text messages was unconstitutional. The court ruled that the FBI's interest in maintaining the appearance of impartiality in its investigations outweighed Strzok's First Amendment right to express his political opinions on his government-issued phone. The judge also dismissed his Fifth Amendment due process claim, stating there was no evidence to support his argument that he had a property interest in his tenure. Strzok was a key figure in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell indicated that the league might begin renegotiating its massive media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion deal has an opt-out after the 2029-30 season, but Goodell noted the rapidly changing media landscape provides an incentive for both the league and its partners to renegotiate sooner. An earlier deal could secure billions in additional revenue for the NFL, potentially increasing the salary cap and team valuations. The league would need agreement from its current partners, including Disney, Comcast, Paramount, Amazon, and Fox, to begin discussions.</p>

          <p>Gold remains a significant commodity for investors, often viewed as a safe-haven asset during periods of economic instability and a hedge against inflation. The price of gold, which stood at $3,770.97 per ounce on September 24, is subject to constant fluctuation based on a variety of factors. Key drivers include supply and demand dynamics, global economic health, inflation rates, and central bank policies. Geopolitical turmoil and movements in the U.S. dollar also play a crucial role in determining its value, as uncertainty often drives investors toward the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study by the Lowy Institute indicates that China has become the leading external partner in Southeast Asia, overtaking the United States in overall influence. The report's index, which measures economic relationships, defense networks, and diplomatic and cultural sway, shows China as the most influential power in six of the region's eleven countries. China's economic dominance is cited as its strongest asset, as it is the region's top export market and source of imports. While regional nations are diversifying to avoid over-dependence, China's deep engagement continues to solidify its prominent position.</p>

          <p>Addie E. Citchens's debut novel, "Dominion," is reviewed as a compelling portrait of a fictional Mississippi town where Black church culture and high-school football dominate community life. The book follows two women, a mother and a girlfriend, connected by their love for a troubled teenage boy named Wonder, as they navigate a society that seeks to suppress sexuality. The review praises the novel's depiction of how these repressive forces can lead to destructive outcomes, particularly after Wonder has a queer encounter that sends him spiraling. While the narrative is described as brisk and powerful, the reviewer suggests some characters could have been more deeply explored.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts emphasize the importance of asking a simple question to determine if a financial advisor can be trusted: "Are you a fiduciary?" A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in their client's best interest, whereas other professionals may only be held to a "suitability" standard, meaning their recommendations only need to be appropriate, not necessarily optimal. Working with a non-fiduciary can lead to being sold high-cost products that benefit the advisor more than the client. Consumers are advised to verify an advisor's status through the SEC and seek professionals who commit to being a fiduciary at all times.</p>

          <p>A cost comparison highlights the financial benefits of driving an electric vehicle like a Tesla over a traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, such as a Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck. Due to higher efficiency, charging a Tesla is often significantly cheaper than fueling an ICE vehicle, with savings becoming more pronounced the more miles are driven. The analysis is based on average residential electricity rates for home charging, which is where the majority of EV charging occurs. The article illustrates that even for average monthly mileage, the fuel savings for a Tesla owner can be substantial.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung has initiated a campaign to amend the constitution to allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year term limit. Proponents argue the change would create political stability by aligning presidential and parliamentary election cycles, fostering policy continuity. The reform, which requires a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly, faces likely opposition from conservative parties. The proposal also includes introducing a run-off round in presidential elections and updating constitutional language on minority rights and relations with North Korea.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump as productive, following a notable shift in Trump's public stance on the war with Russia. After their discussion, Trump posted on social media that he believes Ukraine is in a position to "WIN all of Ukraine back," a significant pivot from his previous skepticism about Kyiv's military prospects. Zelenskyy noted that Trump now seems better informed about the details of the conflict. While the statement was met with cautious optimism in Kyiv, it remains unclear if this rhetorical change will translate into a concrete U.S. policy pivot.</p>
