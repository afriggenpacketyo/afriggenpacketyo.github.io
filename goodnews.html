Despite this criticism, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, who has delivered conservative votes on key issues such as overturning Roe v Wade and expanding gun rights. The analysis suggests that while there are rumblings of discontent, Barrett remains a conservative force on the bench, but she is a jurist rather than an activist.</p>

This discovery raises questions about how such a small star could host such a large planet. The planet is also unusually cold, which may allow for atmospheric observations to reveal the presence of ammonia.</p>
