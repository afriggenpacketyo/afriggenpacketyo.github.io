          <p>Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist and primatologist whose groundbreaking work revolutionized the understanding of chimpanzees, has died at 91. The Jane Goodall Institute announced she passed away from natural causes while on a speaking tour in California. Goodall began documenting chimpanzee lives in Tanzania in the 1960s, famously discovering their use and making of tools, which reshaped scientific views on human-animal distinctions. She founded her institute in 1977, continued vital research at Gombe, and later served as a UN Messenger of Peace, tirelessly advocating for environmental protection and inspiring generations.

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique, silent response when questioned by reporters about remaining the team's No. 3 quarterback.

Sanders, a former college star for Colorado and son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, had been considered a potential first-round pick before dropping to the Browns in the fifth round. His mute response may be a reaction to recent critical remarks from former NFL coach and current analyst Rex Ryan, adding a layer of intrigue to the team's dynamics.
