          <p>Hong Kong has passed a stablecoin bill to expand its cryptocurrency licensing regime, requiring stablecoin issuers to obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. The law focuses on fiat-referenced stablecoins and includes requirements for asset reserve management and segregation of client assets. This policy aims to foster financial stability and encourage financial innovation within the virtual asset sector. The government anticipates the stablecoins policy will take effect this year, allowing sufficient time for industry understanding. </p>

          <p>Nike is set to increase prices on select trainers and clothing starting June 1, following Adidas's warning of price hikes due to US tariffs. The sportswear giant cited regular "price adjustments" as the reason, though almost all of Nike's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region affected by President Trump's tariffs. Most Nike shoes costing over $100 will see price increases of up to $10, while clothing and equipment will rise by $2 to $10. Nike's finance chief previously noted the company was navigating external factors, including tariffs, that create uncertainty. </p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has announced a breakthrough in developing a hypersonic engine powered by ordinary jet fuel, potentially enabling sustained hypersonic cruise from Mach 6 to 16. The team successfully tested an oblique detonation engine (ODE) chamber burning RP-3 aviation kerosene, simulating flight conditions at Mach 8. This achievement has reignited global debates over the viability of the technology, which was first proposed by US military researchers in 1958 but faced skepticism due to technical hurdles. </p>

          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high above $111,000, driven by positive momentum, optimism around U.S. crypto regulation, and institutional buyer interest. The price rise occurred despite a drop in U.S. stock markets, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt also contributed to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a bitcoin skeptic, announced the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring the use of airborne DNA to track global biodiversity. By analyzing DNA collected from air filters, researchers can identify hundreds of species of insects, plants, fungi, birds, and mammals. This approach allows for large-scale monitoring of biodiversity and can help track the impact of conservation efforts. The technique could be integrated into existing air quality monitoring networks, turning them into global wildlife monitoring systems. </p>
