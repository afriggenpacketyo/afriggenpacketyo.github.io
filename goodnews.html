          <p>Swiss author Dorothee Elmiger has been awarded the prestigious 2025 German Book Prize for her novel "Die Holländerinnen" ("The Dutch Women").

The jury praised the work as a "fascinating journey into the heart of darkness." The prize, endowed with €25,000, is one of the most significant literary awards for German-language authors.</p>

The guidance comes as the NCSC reports an increase in "nationally significant" incidents, where hacks can halt operations, as seen in recent attacks on major retailers. The agency urges a focus on "resilience engineering," ensuring that organizations can continue to function and communicate without their IT systems in the event of a successful breach.</p>

          <p>Shares of U.S.-based rare earth mining companies rallied significantly after President Trump threatened China with 100% tariffs in response to Beijing's new export controls on the critical minerals. Companies like Critical Metals and MP Materials saw substantial premarket gains, extending a rally from the previous session. The market volatility reflects investor concern over a renewed trade dispute, as China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths, which are essential for many modern technologies.

          <p>Hu Xijin, the influential former editor-in-chief of the state-owned Global Times tabloid, has publicly called for more tolerance for free expression on Chinese social media. In a widely circulated post, Hu warned against a "collective silence" from public figures, stating that a decline in societal tolerance has made expressing opinions online increasingly risky.

          <p>This opinion piece argues in favor of a new California law that will make it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to conceal their identity with a mask during public enforcement actions. The author, a former police commander, asserts that accountability requires visibility and that hiding an officer's identity erodes public trust and blurs the line between a lawful arrest and an abduction. The article dismisses criticisms that the law is "political theater," stating it reinforces professionalism and the principle that state power must be answerable to the public.</p>

          <p>This essay explores the fracturing definition of American patriotism, arguing that both the political right and left have abandoned a healthy, active form of civic devotion. The author contends that the Trump-led right has embraced a "blood-and-soil" nationalism that excludes those who don't fit a narrow identity, while the progressive left has become cynical and alienated, viewing patriotism as an embrace of a flawed history. The piece calls for a return to a patriotism rooted in the nation's founding democratic ideals and the active participation of all citizens in realizing them.</p>
