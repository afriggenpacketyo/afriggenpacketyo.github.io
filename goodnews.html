          <h2>Archer Aviation Stock Drops After $850 Million Share Sale</h2>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a roughly 15% decrease following the company's announcement of an $850 million share sale. The electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) company intends to use the funds to bolster its infrastructure, introduce an AI-based aviation software platform, and support its Launch Edition program, including a partnership for air taxi services at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. CEO Adam Goldstein highlighted the company's strengthened financial position, noting it has the resources to expand both domestically and internationally. The stock offering occurred after President Trump established a pilot program to foster eVTOL vehicle development and deployment in the U.S., and the United Arab Emirates is slated to be Archer's first launch market. The optimism score for this article reflects the company's continued growth despite a temporary setback in stock price.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the costs of borrowing $100,000 using a home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC) in the current economic climate. While rates are nearly identical as of mid-June 2025, HELOC rates are variable and could fluctuate significantly depending on market conditions. The article highlights that HELOCs could become cheaper if interest rate cuts are issued, and borrowers won't incur refinancing costs as rates adjust automatically. It advises homeowners to carefully consider the pros and cons of each option and assess their financial needs to determine affordability, as the home serves as collateral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Portrait Gallery, resigned two weeks after President Trump stated he was firing her for being partisan and supporting DEI. The Smithsonian is not part of the executive branch, and the president does not choose its Board of Regents, leading to questions about Trump‚Äôs authority to fire Sajet. The Board of Regents affirmed the institution's independence and directed Secretary Bunch to ensure unbiased content in Smithsonian museums. Sajet stated that stepping aside was the best way to serve the institution, and the Smithsonian faces the task of remaining nonpartisan following Trump‚Äôs executive order directing the removal of ‚Äúimproper ideology.‚Äù The optimism score reflects the uncertainty surrounding the Smithsonian's future direction amidst political pressures.</p>

          <p>The article explains how to adjust privacy settings on the Meta AI app to prevent prompts from being shared publicly. The app, launched in April, has faced criticism and privacy concerns over prompts being shared publicly from user accounts, and users can adjust settings to protect their privacy. The steps include clicking on the profile photo, navigating to data and privacy settings, and toggling off the sharing of prompts on Facebook and Instagram, and Meta has invested heavily in AI to compete against rivals like Google and OpenAI. The optimism score is fairly high, as the article provides clear steps to address privacy concerns, reflecting a proactive approach to user protection.</p>
