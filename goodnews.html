          <p>Members of the USA Swimming team are contending with an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis while competing at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. The team's medical staff is actively treating affected athletes and implementing preventative measures, though the specific cause and number of swimmers impacted have not been disclosed. Despite the health challenges, which caused some Olympians to miss individual events, the team has shown resilience. Both the men's and women's 4x100m freestyle relay teams secured medals, demonstrating their determination to perform to the best of their abilities for the remainder of the competition.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most European goods, a figure lower than the 30% rate previously threatened by President Trump. The agreement, announced following discussions with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, also reportedly includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest an additional $600 billion. While European leaders expressed relief at avoiding a more severe trade conflict, some voiced caution about the economic impact of the new tariffs, which will make transatlantic trade more expensive.

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area has the potential to become a premier destination for sustainable, low-carbon tourism. Policymakers are already implementing green initiatives, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transport system. The piece suggests that this focus on smart infrastructure and climate innovation should be leveraged to create an integrated green tourism corridor. By combining advanced hardware with coordinated policies and unique travel experiences, the region can cater to the growing demand for environmentally conscious travel and establish a new model for the tourism economy.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland, with discussions expected to focus on the Gaza ceasefire and transatlantic trade. Starmer aims to press for further reductions in U.S. tariffs on UK goods, building on a previous trade agreement. The meeting also highlights the delicate diplomatic position the UK holds, balancing its relationship with the U.S. against the stance of European allies, particularly after France announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The talks will navigate these complex foreign policy differences while seeking progress on both fronts.</p>

          <p>The new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union allows both sides to claim a victory, though significant questions about its implementation persist. For the EU, the 15% tariff is preferable to the threatened 30%, while the U.S. anticipates substantial tariff revenue and a $600 billion influx of investment. However, this analysis notes that the specifics regarding the timing and allocation of these investments are still undefined. The agreement marks a pivotal moment in the U.S. strategy of renegotiating major trade relationships, setting a precedent for upcoming talks with China. (not investment advice)</p>
