          <p>Adobe reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, surpassing analysts' expectations for both earnings and revenue. The design software company's revenue grew by 11% year-over-year, and it provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, also exceeding market predictions. This positive performance led to a rise in Adobe's stock price during extended trading, offering a bright spot for a stock that had underperformed its tech peers throughout the year. The company also raised its full-year growth forecast for its digital media business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent interviewing several candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce its economic footprint and organically shrink its large bond portfolio without disrupting markets. This process occurs as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for an interest rate cut, with a decision widely expected at the upcoming committee meeting. The leadership transition could significantly alter the Fed's direction in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen to their lowest point in almost a year, with the average 30-year term now at 6.35%. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. The article advises potential borrowers to assess why rates are falling and whether to act now or wait for a further potential drop, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again. It emphasizes that for a refinance to be worthwhile, the new rate should be significantly lower to offset closing costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American-based projects funded by a $550 billion Japanese investment. This arrangement is part of a new trade deal where Japan faces a 15% baseline tariff. Once Japan recoups its initial investment, the profit-sharing model will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. The deal is intended to boost domestic manufacturing in sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, using Japanese capital for projects selected by the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock fell 6% after a record-setting rally, following concerns that its projected growth is predominantly tied to a single major client, OpenAI. The company's stock had surged nearly 36% after announcing massive new contracts and forecasting a fourteen-fold expansion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. However, a subsequent report revealed that OpenAI is expected to pay Oracle $300 billion over five years, tempering investor enthusiasm. This development highlights the market's sensitivity to customer concentration risk, even amidst the booming demand for AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A debate is growing in Germany over whether classic literature by authors like Goethe should be replaced with more contemporary and diverse works in school curricula. Students and reformers argue that current reading lists, dominated by white male authors, fail to reflect the country's modern multicultural society and are not relevant to young people's lives. While education officials have made some moves to include more female and modern authors, systemic change is slow. Proponents of the classics maintain they are essential for understanding history and developing critical thinking, suggesting the issue lies more with teaching methods than the texts themselves.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has launched a new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras that has quickly sold out online, indicating strong consumer demand. The small, stylish cameras are marketed as fashion accessories and tap into Gen Z's appetite for vintage aesthetics and the "blind box" purchasing trend. This early success provides a potential bright spot for Kodak, a company that has been facing significant financial struggles, including a recent warning about its ability to continue operations. The popularity of the Charmera suggests a successful pivot into nostalgia-driven consumer electronics.</p>

          <p>Belarus has released 52 political prisoners, including journalists and activists, as part of a deal with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. The release was described by authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko as a humanitarian gesture, though over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated following a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2020. The deal represents a diplomatic negotiation aimed at improving relations and potentially reopening the U.S. embassy in Minsk.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would be a modest increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. While any increase is helpful, retirees remain concerned that rising costs for essentials, particularly Medicare premiums, could outpace the adjustment. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of third-quarter inflation data is calculated by the Social Security Administration. (not investment advice)</p>
