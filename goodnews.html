          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 12:26:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has announced plans to ease cuts to winter fuel payments, a policy U-turn following mounting political pressure. The move comes after more than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The income threshold for pension credit, the main benefit to qualify to continue to receive winter fuel payments, is currently ¬£11,800 for individuals and ¬£18,023 for pensioner couples. Age UK welcomed the change in approach but said any new system should ensure pensioners on "low and modest incomes" would be able to keep the payments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is directing Pfizer and Moderna to broaden warning labels on their COVID-19 vaccines concerning the potential risk of heart inflammation side effects, particularly among young males aged 16 to 25. The updated warnings are based on recent data indicating a higher incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in this demographic following vaccination. This action follows earlier warnings specifying ages 18 to 24 for Moderna's vaccine and 12 to 17 for Pfizer's, and the new warnings ordered by the FDA add that the "highest estimated incidence was in males 16 through 25 years of age," with a rate of 38 cases per million.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers and a de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The cryptocurrency's price has been steadily climbing in May, up 16% for the month, with cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking the price of bitcoin surpassing $40 billion last week. The cryptocurrency has benefited from both liquidity in the stock market giving a boost to risk assets, as well as recent risk-off scenarios related to concerns about tariffs and deficits in the U.S. that have driven gains in gold as well as bitcoin.

          <p>NFL owners have voted against banning the "tush push," a signature short-yardage play successfully used by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal to ban the play failed to receive the required 75% support from NFL owners. The play, also known as "The Brotherly Shove," involves pushing the quarterback forward in short-yardage situations. The Eagles have been particularly successful with this play, leading to discussions about player safety and the play's impact on the game.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after World War II, efforts are underway to revitalize Dutch synagogues, particularly those that served Jewish communities devastated by the Holocaust. The Uilenburger synagogue in Amsterdam, once a hub for poor Ashkenazi Jews, has been restored as a venue for events and cultural activities. Similarly, the synagogue in Sliedrecht, the only one built on a dike, now hosts musical events and guided tours, preserving the memory of its former Jewish community. These restorations symbolize a rebirth of Jewish life and culture in the Netherlands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bipartisan "no tax on tips" bill, potentially allowing workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028. Sen. Ted Cruz stated the bill will give "real relief to hard-working Americans." The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates that roughly 4 million U.S. workers are in tipped occupations. Alex Muresianu of the Tax Foundation notes the policy could incentivize tipping in new occupations or misclassification of income as tips, and that, "For the lowest income tipped workers, it provides no marginal benefit" but "It would benefit moderate to middle income workers substantially."</p>
