Sweden's comedy trio KAJ is favored to win with their song about saunas, but the event is marked by controversy due to Israel's participation and pro-Palestinian protests.

          <p>President Trump is reportedly pushing for a nuclear deal with Iran, despite resistance from U.S. conservatives who demand a complete halt to uranium enrichment. Trump's efforts are supported by Gulf Arab states seeking regional stability. Negotiations are ongoing, led by Steve Witkoff, but significant gaps remain, as Iran insists on its right to civilian enrichment under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Trump is using the threat of military action to pressure Iran, while exploring creative solutions to bridge the divide over enrichment, including long-term freezes and phased program adjustments.</p>

Since 2019, UAE-aligned firms have announced $110 billion worth of deals in Africa, dwarfing pledges from other countries. This is part of a broader plan to diversify the UAE's economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains. While the U.S. is reducing its presence, the UAE's investments are raising concerns about its strategic and political interests in the region.</p>

He contrasts this with a more grievance-focused approach to Black history, advocating for a celebration of Black achievements and a complex understanding of historical figures like Booker T.

Henderson stretched out a hand outside the box to divert the ball away from Manchester City striker Erling Haaland. VAR checked the incident and allowed play to continue without any sanction. The explanation given was: "The direction in which Erling Haaland was going made it possible, but not [denying] an obvious goal scoring opportunity." Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney said on the BBC One coverage that it was "100% a red card" and called to "get rid of VAR".</p>
