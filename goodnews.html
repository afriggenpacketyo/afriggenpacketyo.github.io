          <p>WNBA star Brittney Griner made her first return to Phoenix since joining the Atlanta Dream, leading her new team to a 90-79 victory over her former club, the Mercury. Before the game, the Mercury paid tribute to Griner with a video, celebrating her 11 seasons and 2014 championship with the team. Griner, who was a nine-time All-Star with Phoenix, expressed that seeing former teammates like Diana Taurasi courtside felt good and ignited her performance. She finished the game with a strong 17 points and nine rebounds for Atlanta.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England established a commanding position on the second day of the fourth Test against India, driven by a powerful performance from both its bowlers and opening batsmen. Captain Ben Stokes secured his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helping to dismiss India for 358. In response, England's openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett launched an aggressive assault, scoring 166 for the first wicket at a rapid pace. Despite their eventual dismissals for 84 and 94 respectively, England ended the day strongly at 225-2, trailing by only 133 runs.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched the public beta for iOS 26, allowing iPhone users to preview the most significant software redesign since 2013 before its official fall release. The new interface, called "Liquid Glass," introduces translucent, animated buttons and menus for a more fluid user experience across Apple devices. Key updates include a revamped Phone app that consolidates calls and voicemails, along with enhanced spam filtering. However, major promised updates to the Siri voice assistant are notably absent and are not expected until at least 2026.</p>

          <p>Democratic Governor Tony Evers of Wisconsin has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the key battleground state in 16 years. Citing a desire to spend more time with his family after five decades in public service, the 73-year-old's decision opens the door for a competitive 2026 election. Evers' tenure was marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, and by his push for new legislative maps that are more favorable to Democrats.</p>

          <p>Job postings that mention artificial intelligence have risen dramatically, indicating a growing demand for an AI-capable workforce, according to a Brookings Institution report. Over the past year, such postings increased by over 100%, with an average annual growth rate of nearly 29% over 15 years. This trend is driven by more companies integrating AI into their operations, with roles ranging from specialized AI engineers to general positions requiring AI skills. These jobs often command higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles without an AI requirement.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Shares Surge in Meme Stock Rally Sparked by Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 13:27:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters jumped significantly, becoming the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge appears linked to the announcement of a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney for the company's denim line. With over 13% of its available shares sold short, the stock became a target for retail investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This activity can create a "short squeeze," artificially inflating the stock price as short sellers buy shares to cover their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has denied claims that he plans to undermine Elon Musk's businesses, such as Tesla and SpaceX, by revoking their substantial government subsidies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated he wants Musk and all American businesses to "THRIVE like never before," directly countering speculation fueled by their recent public disagreements. The statement comes after the White House suggested it did not want federal agencies working with Musk's xAI and after the Trump administration reviewed SpaceX's critical government contracts.

          <p>Despite high preseason expectations, the Los Angeles Dodgers are approaching the MLB trade deadline with clear needs, particularly in their bullpen. While the team's lineup and starting rotation possess immense talent, recent struggles and injuries have exposed vulnerabilities. The front office is expected to acquire a high-leverage relief pitcher but faces a more complex decision on whether to pursue other major upgrades. The organization appears to be betting on its established, high-priced stars to return to form rather than making drastic roster changes, viewing their potential resurgence as an internal solution.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has walked back its plan to phase out paper checks, confirming it will continue issuing them to beneficiaries who have no other way to receive payments. The reversal follows concerns raised by lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who highlighted that hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly seniors and the unbanked, rely on physical checks. The agency had previously announced a switch to all-electronic payments after September 30, citing cost savings and security. The SSA will now continue to offer checks while still encouraging recipients to switch to electronic deposits.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has sent a revised anti-corruption bill to parliament after an earlier version sparked widespread protests and condemnation from the European Union. The initial bill was criticized for giving the government more power over anti-corruption bodies, seen as a major step backward for the country's rule of law. The controversy led to the first large-scale unrest in Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion. Zelenskyy stated the new bill guarantees the independence of these crucial institutions, a key requirement for Ukraine's ambitions to join the EU and maintain Western support.</p>

          <p>The 27th season of 'South Park' opened with an episode that sharply satirized both President Donald Trump and its parent company, Paramount. The premiere came just a day after the show's creators signed a new $1.5 billion deal with the media giant. The episode, "Sermon on the Mount," directly referenced recent controversies, including Trump's lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of Stephen Colbert's show, and the power the president wields over media companies. The defiant episode was seen by media observers as a bold move, criticizing its new business partners in its signature provocative style.</p>
