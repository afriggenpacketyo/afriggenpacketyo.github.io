          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley achieved his first French Open victory by defeating Swiss veteran Stan Wawrinka in straight sets. Fearnley, making his Roland Garros debut, won 7-6 (8-6), 6-3, 6-2, against the 2015 champion, who is currently ranked 138th in the world. The Scot, who was only three years old when Wawrinka debuted at the French Open in 2005, secured the win in just over two hours. This marks a significant milestone for Fearnley, who had never played an ATP Tour match on clay before this year, and signals a passing of the torch moment in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania, seeking support from ethnic Hungarians in the region. Magyar's 11-day, 300-kilometer walk aimed to address the concerns of Hungarians and signal the end of Viktor Orban's era, amid accusations from Orban that Magyar is working for the Ukrainian secret service. The article highlights the historical significance of ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries as an important voter group and the political missteps by Orban that have created an opportunity for Magyar. Recent polls suggest Magyar's party could defeat Orban's in the next parliamentary election, focusing on corruption and infrastructure issues.</p>
