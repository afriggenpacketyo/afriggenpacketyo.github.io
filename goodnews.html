          <p>Sir Tom Farmer, the Edinburgh-born founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, has died peacefully at his home at the age of 84. He built Kwik Fit into the world's largest independent tyre and automotive chain, eventually operating in over 2,000 locations across 18 countries, before selling it to Ford for ¬£1 billion in 1999. Beyond his automotive empire, Sir Tom also held a majority stake in Hibernian FC for 28 years. Knighted in 1997 for his contributions to the automotive industry, he was also recognized for his extensive charitable work with the Carnegie Medal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates are a serious issue that progressives should address, despite the politicization of pronatalism. The author asserts that an aging and shrinking population will lead to a decrease in the quality of life, with fewer people to support the elderly and contribute to society. It refutes the idea that fewer people would be better for the environment, arguing that richer societies are better equipped to combat climate change. The author suggests that policies like less expensive housing, universal pre-K, and affordable healthcare could help people have more children if they want them, while also aligning with progressive values.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, described the conclave to choose the new Pope Leo XIV as an "immensely peaceful" experience. He explained that the cardinals were sealed off from the world in the Sistine Chapel, with no communication permitted until the election was complete. Cardinal Nichols noted the absence of politicking or rancor during the proceedings, emphasizing the calmness and prayerfulness of the process. He added that the experience allowed him time for reflection and patience, free from the distractions of his mobile phone, following the death of Pope Francis on April 21st.</p>

          <p>The article details the story of the Langenhop family, whose three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare immune disorder. The family enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals, which proved successful in enabling the children's immune cells to fight infections. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are healthy and thriving, with none of them requiring hospitalization since the treatment. The therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration, with the goal of making it a licensed product available to treat other patients with LAD-1.</p>

          <p>An order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes in Spain's northeastern Catalonia region was lifted after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The blaze started at a swimming pool cleaning products firm in Vilanova i la Geltru, prompting authorities to issue the confinement order. Fire services stabilized the fire, reporting no casualties and monitoring the area for toxic levels. The warehouse owner suggested a lithium battery may have caused the blaze, and authorities lifted the emergency measure once the toxic cloud began to dissipate.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is claiming a victory after the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV) put its classification as "confirmed right-wing extremist" on hold due to a lawsuit. However, this article states that the BfV has not withdrawn the classification but merely paused it to allow the court time to review the case. The BfV issued a "standstill commitment," meaning it will refrain from designating the AfD as such until the proceedings conclude, giving judges time to work through the extensive report. The article emphasizes that this is standard administrative procedure and does not indicate the AfD's likelihood of success in the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, re-entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after 53 years in space. The spacecraft became stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket booster failure, serving as a reminder of the Cold War space race. While the United States focused on the moon, the Soviet Union pursued Venus through its Venera program, achieving several firsts in planetary exploration. This event highlights the legacy of early space exploration and the ongoing presence of space debris orbiting Earth.</p>
