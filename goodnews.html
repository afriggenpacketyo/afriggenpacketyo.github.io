          <p>After almost a century, Germany has reached an agreement with the House of Hohenzollern, the noble family of the last German Emperor, Wilhelm II, resolving a long-standing dispute over art objects and compensation claims. The agreement establishes the "Hohenzollern Art Foundation" to manage approximately 3,000 art and cultural objects, ensuring they remain in public museums. The settlement addresses claims for expropriated palaces and inventory, with the public benefiting from access to the collections. The dispute centered on whether the Hohenzollerns aided the Nazis, impacting their compensation rights, but negotiations ultimately led to a mutually beneficial resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A $400,000 annuity purchased at age 75 can provide substantial monthly income, ranging from approximately $3,173 to $3,415 for a single individual, depending on gender, and around $2,736 for a joint-life option. Factors such as gender, interest rates, and the annuity structure affect the monthly payments. While annuities offer guaranteed income, they eliminate access to the principal and potential for higher returns from other investments. Deciding whether to invest in an annuity at 75 requires considering one's financial situation, health, and legacy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

Amendments were added to address corruption concerns and protect consumers, requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings and directing the Treasury to monitor suspicious transactions.
