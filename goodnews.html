          <h2>US Transportation Secretary Announces Flight Reductions at Newark Airport Due to Controller Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 10:37:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to reduce flights at Newark Liberty International Airport due to radar outages and a shortage of air traffic controllers, aiming to ensure that booked flights will reliably fly. Duffy intends to meet with airlines to determine the reduction, which will be larger in the afternoons when international flights increase traffic. The FAA experienced a 90-second radar outage at the facility, and a separate equipment outage caused a ground stop for Newark flights. Duffy also plans to raise the mandatory retirement age for air traffic controllers from 56 to 61 and offer a 20% bonus for those who stay on the job, as the Trump administration plans a multibillion-dollar overhaul of the air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ruled her due process and First Amendment rights were likely violated. Ozturk was detained for six weeks after co-authoring an op-ed about Israel's war with Hamas in the Tufts student newspaper, leading to the revocation of her student visa by the Trump administration. Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley welcomed Ozturk back to Massachusetts, emphasizing the importance of protecting due process and free speech rights. Ozturk's lawyers argued her detention was based solely on the expression of her opinion, and her asthma worsened during her time in detention.</p>

          <p>Despite the hype around artificial intelligence, experts suggest that AI is not yet capable of replacing human workers in most industries. A recent survey found that many businesses that laid off employees expecting AI to take over their roles now regret that decision. The current AI platforms are more like enhanced search engines and are not reliable enough to handle core business operations without human oversight. The cost and complexity of building AI systems, along with concerns about data privacy, further limit their adoption by smaller companies.</p>
