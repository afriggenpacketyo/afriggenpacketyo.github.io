          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David H. Souter, appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1990, passed away at his home in New Hampshire at the age of 85. Souter, initially appointed as a Republican, became a key member of the court's liberal wing, often siding with liberal justices on issues such as abortion and church-state relations. He retired in 2009, allowing President Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor, the court's first Latina justice, to fill his seat.

          <p>The Trump administration has reached a preliminary trade deal with the United Kingdom, reducing tariffs on British-made cars and eliminating duties on steel and aluminum. The agreement opens the UK market to American farmers but maintains the UK's ban on US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. The deal is not a comprehensive trade agreement but an outline that requires further negotiations and approval by the US Congress. While Trump hailed the deal as a breakthrough, US automakers voiced concerns about increased competition from UK vehicles.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge back to Earth uncontrolled after 53 years in orbit. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, never left Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts predict the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, but the risk to humans is considered low. The landing capsule, weighing over 1,000 pounds, may survive reentry due to its design for withstanding Venus's atmosphere.</p>
