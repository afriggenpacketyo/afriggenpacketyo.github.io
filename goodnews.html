          <p>A federal judge in Boston has temporarily halted the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students, hours after the university filed a lawsuit challenging the ban. The suit came after the Department of Homeland Security revoked Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, alleging the school tolerated anti-American agitators. The judge stated that Harvard demonstrated it would sustain immediate and irreparable injury without the restraining order. The ban affected over 7,000 current visa holders, including Princess Elisabeth of Belgium.</p>

          <p>Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that the intense criticism aimed at Harvard has become excessive, labeling it "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges the university's ailments but cautions against destroying an institution that has made significant contributions.

He notes that while problems exist, Harvard is not the extremist institution its critics claim, and the government's actions, such as cutting research funding, are harmful and misguided.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that robotaxis will hit the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June. Experts advise investors to approach this emerging technology with caution, just like any other investment opportunity. Consider thematic ETFs to gain exposure to the autonomous vehicle sector, but carefully examine their holdings. Investors should also limit their risk by allocating a small portion of their portfolio to such speculative investments.</p>

          <h2>Judge Affirms Trump's Tariff Authority but Transfers Lawsuit to Another Court</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida suggested that President Trump has the authority to impose tariffs, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. The judge based his ruling on a precedent from a 1970s court case involving a Japanese zipper company. However, the judge ultimately transferred the case to the Court of International Trade in New York. The decision marks the first time a federal judge has suggested Trump's imposition of tariffs falls within his authority.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are using two planes for road trips this season, one for players and another for coaches and staff. The decision, driven by the players' desire to spend more time together, aims to promote team chemistry and provide more comfortable seating for rest and recovery. The system also provides a contingency plan in case of mechanical delays. Players have praised the change, citing benefits such as increased personal time and improved recovery on off days.</p>

          <h2>Enhanced Mammography Found More Tumors in Women with Dense Breasts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 11:23:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large study found that mammography enhanced with iodine-based dye (contrast-enhanced mammography) can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound. While M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors than standard mammograms, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective. However, its use for breast cancer screening has not been approved by the FDA due to concerns over allergic reactions to the contrast agent. The study suggests contrast-enhanced mammography should become the standard of care for women with dense breasts.</p>

          <p>A man in Port Macquarie, Australia, was attacked by a kangaroo in floodwaters, with witnesses reporting the animal appeared to try and drown him.
