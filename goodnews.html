          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic expedition to study the evolution of oceans and the forces behind climate change. A total of 25 members from both countries will spend 45 days aboard a research ship in the Bering Sea and northwestern Pacific. This ninth joint expedition focuses on the effects of a changing climate on deep-sea environments and signals renewed scientific cooperation. The mission is also seen by some as strengthening their strategic partnership, particularly concerning ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:33:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision, declaring the executive order to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional. The ruling from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocks the administration's attempt to deny citizenship to many individuals born on U.S. soil. This legal battle challenges a core principle of the 14th Amendment, which was established in 1868 and grants citizenship to nearly everyone born in the country. The case is now positioned to potentially advance to the Supreme Court for a final determination.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps May Be a More Attainable Health Goal Than 10,000</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 23:27:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in The Lancet Public Health indicates that walking 7,000 steps a day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This finding challenges the widely promoted but less evidence-based goal of 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. Researchers suggest that this more realistic and achievable target could encourage more people to engage in daily physical activity for tangible and substantial health benefits.</p>

          <p>An Australian federal court has ruled that five women who were subjected to invasive searches at Doha's airport in 2020 can proceed with their lawsuit against Qatar Airways. The women were removed from a flight and examined to determine if they had recently given birth after a baby was found abandoned in an airport terminal. This appeal overturns a previous ruling that the state-owned airline was protected from such lawsuits under international travel laws. The decision allows the women's case for damages to advance to trial.</p>

          <p>During a summit in Beijing marking 50 years of diplomatic ties, Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the EU and China to deepen trust and cooperation in a turbulent world. However, the meeting was overshadowed by significant disagreements over trade imbalances, uneven market access for EU firms, and China's stance on the war in Ukraine. Despite the rhetoric of partnership, the relationship remains complex and strained, with the European Union viewing China as both a critical partner and a systemic rival on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A Scripps Institute of Oceanography researcher has discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically found in the area. These pelagic snails float on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft and are usually located in warmer, tropical seas. Their appearance, the first confirmed sighting by Scripps in a decade, coincides with unusually warm offshore waters. This has prompted researchers to consider it a potential indicator of climate change's impact on marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>After making his debut at first base for the San Francisco Giants, Rafael Devers made a surprising admission, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This contrasts with his time at the Boston Red Sox, where he reportedly resisted a move from DH duties. Devers explained that being on the field keeps him more engaged in the game and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This marks a notable change in perspective for the three-time MLB All-Star.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the first, a figure that surpassed expectations and allowed the country to avoid a technical recession. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly semiconductors and petroleum products, as some firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that domestic demand is still sluggish and that future growth could be hampered by global trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the U.S. housing market is still largely considered a seller's market, there are emerging signs of a minor shift that could provide some relief to buyers. An increase in the number of homes for sale is giving buyers more options and slightly increasing the time houses sit on the market. However, median sale prices hit a new record high in June, driven by tight inventory from homeowners locked into low mortgage rates. This continues to make affordability a major challenge for many prospective purchasers. (not investment advice)</p>
