          <p>England's rugby team defeated the United States with a decisive 40-5 score in a match significantly delayed by lightning in Washington D.C. The game was paused for nearly two hours due to severe weather, but England maintained control, scoring six tries to complete their tour with an undefeated record. Despite the disruptions, several players made their debut for the English side, which had made numerous changes from its previous game. The victory showcased the team's depth and resilience under unusual circumstances at Audi Field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass attacks by individuals who are not driven by a specific ideology. The legislation will empower police to intervene and charge suspects who are found preparing for mass killings, closing a legal gap that currently distinguishes them from terror suspects. This move comes in response to incidents like the Southport attack, where the perpetrator lacked a clear ideological motive, making pre-emptive prosecution difficult under existing terrorism laws. The goal is to treat the planning of such violent acts as seriously as terrorism.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Potential Benefits and Drawbacks of Shorter Summer School Holidays</h2>

          <p>A debate is growing in the United Kingdom over the merits of shortening the traditional six-week summer school holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare and financial burdens on working parents, and help combat "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, believe the long break is essential for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers impacts on travel costs and whether the school calendar should adapt to changing climate patterns.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for a cultural shift to encourage more citizens, particularly women, to invest in stocks and shares rather than relying solely on low-interest cash savings accounts (ISAs). Reeves argues that savers are missing out on potential long-term rewards because risk warnings often overshadow the benefits of investing. The government plans to launch an ad campaign and have banks notify customers with large savings about investment options. However, some experts caution that pushing inexperienced individuals into volatile markets could backfire if not handled carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, exclusive members-only clubs is gaining popularity in India, catering to the country's "nouveau riche" of tech entrepreneurs and creative professionals. These clubs, such as Soho House, offer a more relaxed and contemporary alternative to the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which often have long waiting lists and cater to old-money families. While still exclusive and expensive, the new clubs prioritize personal accomplishment and creative merit over family legacy for membership. This trend reflects India's changing economic landscape and the rise of a new, self-made elite.</p>

          <p>Germany is actively pivoting its foreign policy to foster a closer security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, a partnership now known as the "E3." This strategic shift, spearheaded by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty regarding the United States' long-term commitment to European defense under a potential Trump presidency. The cooperation, which includes a new bilateral treaty with the UK, aims to bolster Europe's own defense capabilities, with the French and British nuclear deterrents seen as a potential supplement to the US security guarantee.</p>
