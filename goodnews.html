          <p>Germany is set to celebrate its first official Veterans Day on June 15, honoring members of the German military with a large civic celebration and events nationwide. This marks a shift in German society, which has historically lacked a strong tradition of honoring veterans due to the legacy of Nazi Germany. The decision to establish Veterans Day follows increasing deployments of German soldiers abroad and growing recognition of the sacrifices made by veterans. However, the event has also sparked protests from left-wing groups criticizing the "glorification of the Bundeswehr."</p>
