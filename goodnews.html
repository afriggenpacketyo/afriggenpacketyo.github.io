          <p>The article explores the challenges of maintaining friendships after having children, noting that assumptions about availability and shared interests can lead to distance between parents and non-parents. Experts emphasize the importance of open communication, compassion, and flexibility in bridging the gap. Parents are encouraged to invite child-free friends to family events, while non-parents should be understanding of the logistical hurdles parents face. Ultimately, the article suggests that evolving friendships can still provide valuable balance and support, even if they look different than before.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his nomination of Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer known for her "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as the next US Surgeon General. Means, who has a medical degree from Stanford but is not board-certified in a medical specialty, has been vocal about her views on nutrition, vaccines, and the healthcare system. Her perspectives often align with those of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., focusing on tackling chronic disease and promoting a healthier food supply. Her appointment has sparked controversy due to her skepticism about vaccine safety and criticism of conventional medical practices.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government, under President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for complying with a decree issued by former US President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mexico asserts that Google should only apply the name "Gulf of America" to the portion of the gulf within US territory and retain "Gulf of Mexico" for the areas bordering Mexico and Cuba. Google's decision aligns with its policy of following official US government geographic designations, but Mexico argues this disregards the historical and territorial significance of the Gulf's name.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a music conductor diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS). After medications became less effective, Laycock opted for DBS, a procedure involving an implanted device that delivers electrical currents to specific areas of the brain. He later transitioned to adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS), a more advanced form of therapy that fine-tunes stimulation in real-time based on brain activity. As a result, Laycock's tremors are now minimal, allowing him to continue his career as a conductor.</p>

However, ongoing unrest and uncertainty in the region complicate the messaging, making business deals a more tangible measure of success for the president, who currently lacks major policy achievements in the Middle East.</p>

Kukoyi, who has been a fan since childhood, recalls how the show captured his imagination and provided a sense of hope. The episode is also significant because it features a cast and crew that can authentically portray African stories and cultures, addressing the show's historical lack of representation of the continent. Despite the show's limited accessibility in Nigeria due to streaming service requirements, Kukoyi anticipates a dedicated group of Nigerian fans will watch the episode.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere by the end of this weekend after a rocket malfunction left it stranded in orbit. Experts are uncertain about where the spacecraft will land, but the area is between 52 degrees north and south latitude, which covers most populated areas. The spacecraft was designed to survive atmospheric entry, so it's possible parts of it will remain intact when it hits the surface. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple has returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to its rightful owner, a Japanese temple, after years of dispute over its ownership. The statue was stolen from Japan in 2012, and while recovered by South Korean authorities, Buseoksa Temple claimed it was looted from them by Japanese pirates centuries ago. After a lengthy legal battle, the South Korean Supreme Court ruled that the statue should be returned to Kannonji Temple in Japan, ending the dispute.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is demanding an apology from the Football Association (FA) after being banned for comments made to a transgender woman opponent. Vaughan questioned the player's gender and raised concerns about fairness and safety with the referee. Although the FA's appeal board later found that Vaughan had received an "unfair" hearing and dropped the case after the complainant withdrew, Vaughan claims the experience has negatively impacted her life. The case sparked debate about the FA's gender eligibility policy.</p>
