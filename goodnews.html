          <p>Firefighters have made significant progress on the 5,370-acre Canyon fire near the Los Angeles-Ventura county line, reaching 28% containment. Evacuation orders for thousands of residents have been downgraded to warnings or lifted, though air quality advisories remain in effect due to smoke. The blaze, which started during a heat wave, destroyed two small structures and injured three firefighters. Favorable overnight weather helped crews, but challenging conditions with high heat and dry fuel persist.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is seeing a boom as people spend on small indulgences and larger experiences to boost morale during uncertain economic times. This behavior, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," involves consumers cutting back on daily essentials but splurging on items like makeup or major events like concerts. Analysts note this trend is driven by a re-evaluation of personal well-being and the perception that traditional life milestones like homeownership are less attainable, indicating a prioritization of immediate, guilt-free joy.

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership that helped guide the crippled spacecraft and its crew safely back to Earth in 1970 after an oxygen tank explosion. He was also part of the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the Moon, and famously described Earth as a "grand oasis in the vastness of space." NASA praised his courage, which turned a potential tragedy into a "successful failure."</p>

The blaze, which may have been caused by an electrical short circuit, was controlled before it could cause major damage to the iconic structure. The building, a jewel of Islamic architecture from the 8th century, was converted into a cathedral in the 13th century.</p>

          <p>Walmart has agreed to a $5.6 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit alleging it overcharged customers in California for certain products. The lawsuit, brought by several county district attorneys, claimed the retailer sold items, particularly weighted goods like produce and baked items, for more than their advertised or correct price. As part of the settlement, Walmart will pay $5.5 million in civil penalties and has agreed to implement measures to ensure accurate pricing in its California stores. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the settlement between Disney and actress Gina Carano, who was fired from "The Mandalorian" over controversial social media posts, was the right decision. The author contends that while Carano's posts were ill-conceived, Lucasfilm's decision to fire her was an overreaction and an act of pandering to a "social media mob." The piece suggests the initial firing was a more significant capitulation than the eventual settlement. The settlement is seen not as a sign of corporate weakness but as a reasonable resolution to an extreme initial response.</p>

The two have bonded over shared experiences, including challenging childhoods and their Christian faith, meeting several times since Lammy was in opposition. This personal relationship is seen as potentially important for UK-US relations, particularly given the personalized nature of diplomacy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times is unsubstantiated. Investigations show there is no evidence to support the claim, and key details discredit it. Epstein's island, Little St. James, did not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane like Trump's to land there; visitors arrived by helicopter or boat. Furthermore, the Facebook user who originated the claim used a profile picture with a pilot costume pin available on Amazon.</p>
