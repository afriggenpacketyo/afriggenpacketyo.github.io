          <p>BeOne Medicines, a global drug company with mainland China origins, is set to significantly expand its presence in Hong Kong by introducing more cancer medications and increasing production. This strategic move leverages Hong Kong's recent drug approval reforms, which have streamlined the process for pharmaceutical companies. The company plans to seek approval for additional medical indications by the end of the year, building on its existing three cancer drug launches. Its Guangzhou facility, currently producing large molecule therapies like PD-1 inhibitors for various Asian markets, is slated to expand capacity and begin supplying Hong Kong, while the Suzhou plant ensures a steady supply of small-molecule drugs. This expansion, following a profitable first half for BeOne, underscores a commitment to meeting growing demand and tapping into greater market opportunities in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sixth episode of "The Celebrity Traitors" delivered high drama, beginning with a cliffhanger and concluding with another, as the game's stakes escalated significantly. Host Claudia Winkleman expressed palpable frustration with the Faithfuls, whose repeated failures to identify Traitors have left them at a severe disadvantage, with only nine players remaining, three of whom are Traitors. A dramatic split banishment vote led to a decision by the "Chest of Chance," while a surprising act of sabotage by a Faithful, Nick Mohammed, to protect others, only fueled further suspicion. The episode culminated in the banishment of Sir Stephen Fry, a prominent Faithful, leaving the remaining players to confront mounting pressure and the Traitors' growing confidence in their brutal game.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton has issued a stern warning to McLaren's title contenders, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" approach as the season enters its crucial final five races. Drawing from his intense 2021 battle with Verstappen, Hamilton emphasized that the McLaren drivers must adopt a similarly ruthless mindset to defend their championship lead. Verstappen, currently 40 points behind Piastri, is seen as having the advantage of being the "hunter," with less to lose. Despite McLaren's strong car and the freedom for their drivers to race each other, consistency will be key to fending off Verstappen's recent surge in form and securing the title amidst high pressure.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai predict that increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China will foster substantial advancements in the cryptocurrency sector. Despite the mainland's years-long ban on various crypto-related activities, both regions possess complementary strengths that could drive mutual growth. Hong Kong is recognized as a leader in crypto regulation and virtual asset trading, while mainland developers are at the forefront of digital payments and artificial intelligence innovation. Organizations like the Solana Foundation are actively investing in China's developer ecosystem, underscoring the potential for deeper cooperation in areas such as decentralized payments and AI, leveraging China's massive payments industry and large population.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are approaching their quest for a third World Series title in six seasons with a remarkable sense of composure, driven by a deeply ingrained organizational ethos. Despite the historical significance of cementing a modern-day dynasty, the team's on-field celebrations for winning the National League pennant were notably subdued, reflecting a singular focus on the championship. Manager Dave Roberts and veteran players emphasize a "one day at a time" mindset, which has enabled them to navigate an injury-plagued regular season and a dominant postseason march. This consistent, disciplined approach, fueled by a culture of sustained success and strategic player acquisitions, allows the Dodgers to embrace their opportunity for history without succumbing to external pressures.</p>

          <p>Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of Microsoft AI, has publicly declared that Microsoft will not develop artificial intelligence services that provide "simulated erotica," clearly distinguishing its ethical approach from that of long-time partner OpenAI. Suleyman emphasized that such services are not aligned with Microsoft's values, even as other companies might pursue them. His statement follows OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's indication that ChatGPT could be used for erotica by verified adults. Suleyman previously advocated against creating "seemingly conscious" AIs that could give the impression of suffering, viewing erotica-focused services as a dangerous manifestation of this concerning trend in AI development.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserted that bullish investors typically triumph in the long run, advising individuals to remain invested despite prevailing market anxieties. He addressed several current concerns, including the ongoing government shutdown, U.S.-China trade tensions, and initial earnings season results, arguing that historical market resilience and company fundamentals often outweigh short-term fears. Cramer noted that stocks have performed surprisingly well during the shutdown, and the impact of tariffs appears to have been largely factored into corporate reports. He urged investors to avoid "catastrophizing" over incoming economic data, reinforcing his conviction in the market's enduring upward trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A panel of U.S. judges has unanimously rejected the Trump administration's effort to delay court rulings on disability benefits claims for veterans, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, notably led by a Trump appointee, found that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs failed to demonstrate sufficient justification for such a sweeping delay across nearly all cases. Veterans groups strongly criticized the administration's request, arguing it exploited the shutdown as a pretext to deny timely access to crucial benefits for those who have often waited decades. This decision represents another instance of federal judges pushing back against Trump administration actions, effectively upholding veterans' rights to prompt judicial review.</p>

This consistent ranking has triggered questions among some Chinese internet users regarding the index's methodology and overall authority. The GII, now in its 18th edition, is a widely recognized international ranking of innovation economies. The ongoing debate highlights differing perspectives on how innovation is effectively measured and the potential for inherent biases within international comparative assessments, prompting a deeper look into the criteria used.</p>
