          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the world's happiest country, a distinction Finns attribute more to contentment than overt joy. The World Happiness Report's ranking is based on citizens' overall life satisfaction, which in Finland is bolstered by a strong social safety net and robust public services. Examples like Helsinki's central library, which offers free access to advanced technology and creative spaces, highlight a societal focus on providing equal opportunities for all residents, supported by a collective acceptance of higher taxes for the common good. The country's emphasis on nature and cultural practices like saunas also contributes to this sustained sense of well-being.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó described the relationship between Hungary and the United States as a "golden age" under the Trump administration, contrasting it with a "hostile approach" from the previous Democratic White House. Speaking at the United Nations, Szijjártó highlighted the two governments' aligned political views, including Hungary's move to declare Antifa a terrorist organization, following the American model. He also affirmed Hungary's support for President Trump's call for increased NATO defense spending and positioned Trump as the "only hope" for achieving peace in the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup victory was built on a foundation of strong team culture and a conscious effort to create an inclusive and supportive environment. Learning from a previous campaign where some players felt isolated, the team, known as the Red Roses, incorporated regular bonding activities like movie nights and themed dinners. Players also developed personal routines, from getting commemorative tattoos to playing board games, to manage the pressure of being tournament hosts and favorites. This focus on unity was visible on game days, with non-selected veterans supporting from the sidelines, demonstrating a collective mindset that ultimately propelled them to the championship.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its publication, Judy Blume's novel "Forever" is remembered as a cultural touchstone that offered a rare depiction of female sexuality and teen relationships from a woman's perspective. For many young readers, obtaining and sharing the book was a rite of passage, providing validation for their own anxieties and desires. The article reflects on the unique power of art discovered during adolescence, which can help young people feel seen and understand complex emotions. Such novels serve as a crucial space for teens to explore what their future lives might be like and to see their private thoughts reflected in a public narrative.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has died at the age of 92. A trailblazing journalist, Davis began her career in the 1960s, a time when the industry was dominated by white men, and became a trusted and respected figure in Bay Area news. She covered some of the region's most significant events, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight Emmy Awards for her work. Colleagues and public figures remembered her as a mentor who opened doors for a generation of journalists and reported with courage, integrity, and grace.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has confirmed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway sold the remainder of its long-held stake in the company earlier this year. A BYD executive described the move as a "completely normal" part of investing, expressing gratitude for the 17 years of support from Buffett and the late Charlie Munger. Berkshire's initial investment in 2008 grew significantly, reportedly earning a 20-fold profit. Despite BYD's calm public response, its shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong this week amid signs of cooling growth, including a recent cut to its 2025 sales target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II after joining the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1944. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, breaking racial barriers while serving with distinction. Hardy also served in the Korean and Vietnam Wars and later became a champion for the legacy of his fellow airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan states that the lower cost of living allows him to escape the "survival mode" he felt in America, where he believed he was constantly struggling financially despite working hard. He describes Vietnam as exceptionally safe and calm, enabling him to focus on personal happiness and goals rather than monetary pressures, a lifestyle he plans to continue indefinitely.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings (CCO), arguing that the company is now an attractive acquisition target. Following a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners, CCO has divested its European and Latin American businesses, transforming into a U.S.-focused company and reducing its debt. Despite these moves, CCO's stock has underperformed its peers. Anson, which has deep familiarity with the company, believes a sale is the best path forward, citing strong private equity appetite for the out-of-home advertising industry and the challenges CCO faces as a standalone public company.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the American housing affordability crisis. By constructing homes in a 110,000-square-foot factory, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional on-site building. The company recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires. While modular construction is still a small fraction of the U.S. housing market, Fading West's model addresses key issues like labor shortages and material waste, offering a scalable path to more affordable home ownership.</p>
