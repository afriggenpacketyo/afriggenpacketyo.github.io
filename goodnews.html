          <p>The Consulate General of India has secured a 10-year lease for a full floor in downtown Los Angeles' AON Center, marking its second office in California. This expansion signals increased cooperation between Los Angeles and India, particularly as Southern California prepares for global events like the 2028 Olympics. The new consulate, which will also serve Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada, aims to make essential services more accessible to the large Indian-American community and foster trade and cultural connections.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured a commanding 69-17 victory over the United States in their World Cup opener, played before a record crowd of 42,723.

Despite the thrashing, head coach John Mitchell emphasized areas for improvement, noting some midfield passes went astray and urging greater clinicality, as the team aims to build pressure and refine their defense for tougher challenges ahead in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and divers have recovered ancient artifacts, including a sphinx statue and Roman coins, from the Mediterranean Sea in Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria, Egypt. These relics, dating back over 2,000 years to the Ptolemaic and Roman eras, likely originate from an extension of the ancient city of Canopus. The damage to the statues, missing heads and feet, suggests destruction by a natural disaster like a tsunami or earthquake, confirming the site was once a fully integrated residential city before Alexandria was submerged.</p>

          <p>Ether (ETH) achieved its first new record since 2021, surging after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual Jackson Hole address hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's comments, suggesting policy adjustments might be warranted, caught traders off-guard, leading to significant short liquidations in ETH and a panicked repositioning in the market. This momentum shift, coupled with regulatory tailwinds boosting institutional interest in stablecoins, which heavily rely on Ethereum, reinforces ether's position as a leading crypto market asset.
