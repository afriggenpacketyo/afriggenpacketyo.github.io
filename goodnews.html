          <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel coalition signed a peace declaration in Doha, committing to a permanent ceasefire and negotiations. The agreement calls for the restoration of state authority in rebel-held areas and sets a timeline for a comprehensive peace accord by early August. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the lack of enforcement mechanisms and immediate disagreements over rebel withdrawal. Past failures to implement similar agreements cast doubt on whether this new pact will bring lasting peace to the conflict-ridden region.</p>

          <p>UK Environment Secretary Steve Reed has committed to a new target of halving the number of sewage discharges by water companies by the year 2030. This pledge follows a 60% rise in serious pollution incidents in 2024 and widespread public anger over the state of the nation's waterways. Reed stated that the water sector is broken and that its regulator, Ofwat, is failing, signaling that significant changes are imminent. He ruled out nationalizing the industry but emphasized that he expects to be held accountable for delivering improvements by the next election.</p>

          <p>Anna Rutherford, a 43-year-old lawyer and mother-of-three from Scotland, won an inaugural 100-mile ultra-marathon with a remarkable time of 17 hours and 23 minutes. She finished more than two hours ahead of the closest male competitor and five hours ahead of the next woman. Running from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh, she led for the final 50 miles by herself, singing Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up. Her dominant performance was so significant that she was already home in bed by the time the rest of the field began to cross the finish line.</p>

          <p>In a commentary piece, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that in a politically polarized country, the search for "common ground" may be less fruitful than finding "neutral ground." Recounting his experience learning to surf with his politically different brother-in-law, Litt argues that shared activities can build friendships and foster genuine discussion, even when deep disagreements persist. He posits that these neutral spaces, where differences are not the focus, are essential for maintaining relationships and bridging divides. The piece encourages people to be open to unlikely friendships and to learn from those they don't fully understand.</p>

          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection, which is the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article argues that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's feelings, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their inner voice, leading to anxiety and insecurity later in life. Cultivating self-connection through validating emotions and allowing autonomy helps build resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. This skill is presented as a crucial foundation for a child's long-term mental and emotional well-being.</p>

The potential meeting could happen either before the summit, possibly with a visit by Trump to China, or on the sidelines of the event itself. This development follows recent high-level talks between the two nations' top diplomats, aimed at stabilizing relations. Since Trump's return to office, the U.S. and China have worked to de-escalate tensions, reaching a preliminary trade deal earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>The small desert community of Newberry Springs, California, a near-ghost town on the historic Route 66, is hoping for a comeback as the famous highway's 100th anniversary approaches in 2026. Once a bustling stop, the town declined after being bypassed by a new interstate in the 1970s. Now, local residents and business owners are planning events and preservation projects to attract the anticipated influx of tourists and caravan drivers celebrating the centennial. They hope the anniversary will breathe new life into their community while preserving its unique, 'frozen in time' rural character.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that traditional U.S. labor market metrics, such as job creation numbers and the unemployment rate, are becoming obsolete in the modern economy. With the rise of the gig economy, remote work, and the 'over-employed' holding multiple jobs, the article suggests that focusing on 'jobs' is no longer relevant. Instead, it proposes a shift to measuring income, suggesting a new key metric could be the percentage of the working-age population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold. This approach would provide a more accurate picture of economic health in an era of diverse income streams. (not investment advice)</p>
