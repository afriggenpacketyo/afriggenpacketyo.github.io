          <h2>Historical Four-Year Bitcoin Price Cycle Shows Signs of Breaking</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that Bitcoin's traditional four-year price cycle, which has historically revolved around its "halving" events, may be ending due to fundamental market shifts. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has introduced significant institutional investment, altering typical price discovery patterns and causing Bitcoin to hit an all-time high before the last halving, not after. Experts also point to a more supportive regulatory environment and increased accumulation by long-term holders as factors that are dampening volatility. This shift could mean that the massive 70-80% price crashes seen in previous cycles are a thing of the past. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the original company's bankruptcy and liquidation, its intellectual property was acquired and is now being used to resurrect the retail chain. The new store's operator, The Brand House Collective, plans to open several more locations in Nashville and potentially convert dozens of its existing Kirkland's Home stores in the coming years. In a nod to its legacy, the new store will honor all old Bed Bath & Beyond 20% off coupons, regardless of their expiration date.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the purchase of 40 shares of Texas Roadhouse, citing the stock's recent pullback as a buying opportunity. The steakhouse chain reported mixed second-quarter results, with strong comparable sales growth offset by rising commodity costs, particularly beef, which led to downward revisions of future earnings forecasts. Despite the margin pressure from inflation, the club highlights the restaurant's strong traffic and brand loyalty as key strengths. The analysis suggests that while beef inflation is a near-term problem, the company's consistent sales performance and plans for accelerated unit growth in 2026 make it an attractive investment.

          <h2>Analysts Suggest Gold Prices Could Decline Amid Cooling Inflation and Geopolitical Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-08 11:29:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant surge over the past two years, the price of gold could be poised for a temporary decline, offering a potential buying opportunity for investors. Key factors that could contribute to a price drop include cooling inflation, which is now approaching the Federal Reserve's target, and an easing of geopolitical tensions. Historically, gold prices rise during periods of economic uncertainty and conflict, so a stabilization in these areas could reduce demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset. While timing the market is difficult, monitoring these macroeconomic indicators could help investors identify a more affordable entry point into the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the clearest image to date of 3I-Atlas, the third known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. The comet, discovered last month, is traveling at 130,000 mph and poses no threat to Earth, as its trajectory will keep it farther away than Mars. Hubble's observations have helped refine the size of the comet's icy core to no more than 3.5 miles in diameter and revealed a teardrop-shaped dust plume and tail. The comet will make its closest approach to the sun in late October and should be visible to telescopes again in December after passing behind the sun.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists from East Carolina University may have discovered the remains of La Fortuna, a Spanish privateer ship that exploded during an attack on a North Carolina port in 1748. The discovery was made at the Brunswick Town/Fort Anderson State Historic Site, where the team found four shipwrecks in total. Wood samples from one wreck suggest it was built with materials from Spanish Caribbean colonies, and its location is near where a cannon believed to be from La Fortuna was recovered in 1985. The team has recovered over 40 timbers from the site for conservation and further study to confirm the ship's identity.</p>

          <p>Following the launch of the advanced GPT-5 model, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will prioritize growth and investment in training and computing power, even if it means operating at a loss for the foreseeable future. Despite being on track for over $20 billion in annual recurring revenue, the company remains unprofitable due to the high costs of developing its AI models. Altman explained that as long as the models continue to improve on a distinct curve, it is rational to run a loss. OpenAI is reportedly in talks for a new stock sale at a valuation around $500 billion, indicating strong investor confidence in its long-term strategy.</p>

          <p>Byron Allen's Allen Media Group has agreed to sell 10 of its television stations to Atlanta-based Gray Media for $171 million. The deal includes network-affiliated stations in markets such as Huntsville, Alabama, and Fort Wayne, Indiana. This move marks a retrenchment for Allen, who had been on a major buying spree in recent years with the goal of becoming the largest independent TV operator in the U.S., but was left with significant debt. Allen Media Group will continue to own other assets, including several television channels and the Weather Channel, while Gray Media will expand its presence into three new markets through the acquisition.</p>

          <p>California's Lieutenant Governor, Eleni Kounalakis, has dropped out of the 2026 governor's race and will instead run for state treasurer. Kounalakis, who was the first major candidate to enter the gubernatorial race in April 2023, stated she can make the greatest impact by focusing on the state's financial future. Her exit reshapes the dynamics of the crowded Democratic field, opening up access to her network of prominent Bay Area political donors. Kounalakis had raised millions for her gubernatorial campaign, much of which she can reportedly transfer to her new race for treasurer, where she will face several other established California politicians.</p>
