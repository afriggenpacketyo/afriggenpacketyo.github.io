          <p>Starbucks has officially launched a "secret menu" within its mobile application, making previously unlisted drink combinations available to its rewards members. This initiative, part of a broader strategy to rejuvenate the brand and improve customer service, introduces four new featured beverages. To generate excitement, the company is also running a contest with a $25,000 prize for the best customer-created drink. The move follows other recent changes, including simplifying the menu and standardizing charges for add-ons, as the coffee giant aims to streamline operations and boost growth under new leadership.</p>

          <p>A new study by CNBC evaluates U.S. states based on quality of life, a crucial factor for attracting talent in today's mobile workforce. The ranking considers metrics such as crime rates, air quality, child care availability, worker protections, and reproductive rights. Vermont claimed the top spot for the fifth consecutive year, praised for its low crime, clean air, and inclusive laws. Other states in the top ten include Maine, New Jersey, and Minnesota, each recognized for strengths like safety and health care, while also noting weaknesses like air quality or child care costs.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Surpasses $120,000, Reaching New Record High Amid Legislative Momentum</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value soared past $120,000, setting a new all-time high driven by strong institutional demand and significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs. The rally coincides with "Crypto Week" in the U.S. Congress, where lawmakers are deliberating on new legislation aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts suggest that increasing institutional adoption and potential policy clarity are key factors fueling investor confidence. While the long-term outlook appears bullish to some, potential risks include future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in response to tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has nominated Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko to become the country's next prime minister, signaling a significant government reshuffle amid the ongoing war. Svyrydenko, who has been credited with securing a key mineral deal with the U.S., would replace incumbent Denys Shmyhal if her candidacy is approved by parliament. This move is part of Zelenskyy's broader effort to renew his government and strengthen Ukraine's position, which also includes considering a new ambassador to the United States. If confirmed, Svyrydenko would be Ukraine's second female prime minister.</p>

While Sweden is a formidable opponent, this path is seen by some analysts as more favorable for a potential run to the final. However, the article notes that Sweden is in strong form, having defeated Germany in the group stage, setting up a challenging quarter-final match.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is championing the "She Drives Act" to address a significant disparity in vehicle crash safety. Data shows women are 73% more likely to be seriously injured and 17% more likely to die in a crash than men, a problem linked to the use of crash test dummies based on an average male physique. The proposed legislation would mandate the use of advanced dummies that better represent the general population, including a smaller female model. Proponents argue this will provide crucial data to design safer cars for everyone.</p>

          <p>China's overall exports saw accelerated growth in June, but its exports to the United States continued to decline, albeit at a slower rate than the previous month. The data reflects a complex trade environment where some U.S. importers rushed orders to get ahead of potential new tariffs, while the broader trade war continues to impact bilateral commerce. For the first half of the year, China's global trade hit a record, fueled by diversification to other markets like Southeast Asia. However, analysts expect export growth to slow, weighing on economic momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially poised to cut interest rates later this year, savers are considering how to best lock in current high yields on certificates of deposit (CDs). Experts offer differing advice on the ideal CD term to choose. Some suggest short-term CDs remain attractive as banks are offering competitive rates, while others argue that a longer-term CD could be advantageous to secure a high rate before they fall. For those unsure, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is presented as a balanced strategy to manage interest rate risk while maintaining some liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. announcement to send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine, this article explains the capabilities of the advanced air-defense weapon. The Patriot is a mobile, surface-to-air system designed to intercept threats like tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft—all of which Russia uses in its attacks. While effective against high-altitude threats, it is less so against smaller, low-flying drones. The deal, which will be paid for by European allies, provides Ukraine with a much-needed defensive tool, building on previous supplies of Patriots and other systems used to counter Russian aerial bombardments.</p>

          <p>General Motors and LG Energy Solution are upgrading their joint-venture battery plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, to produce a new, lower-cost type of electric vehicle battery. The facility will manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells, which are significantly cheaper than standard lithium-ion batteries because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel. GM states this move will help diversify its EV portfolio and make electric vehicles more affordable. Commercial production of the new LFP cells is expected to begin by late 2027, supporting GM's clean energy strategy.</p>

Leijdekkers, known as "Chubby Jos," is a fugitive believed to be hiding in Sierra Leone and was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison for murder and cocaine trafficking. The seized assets were determined to be profits from his criminal activities, including drug shipments and gold purchases.

          <p>China's exports of rare earth elements increased significantly in June, reaching their highest point since 2009. The 60% year-over-year surge comes as Beijing appears to be relaxing some of its stringent export controls on the critical minerals. This development is seen by analysts as a potential sign of a thaw in trade relations, possibly stemming from behind-the-scenes agreements with the United States. The increase follows reports that China had begun issuing new six-month export licenses to select American manufacturers and was working to streamline the approval process for European businesses.
