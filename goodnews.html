          <p>Nintendo anticipates selling 15 million units of its new Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the Switch. The company's fourth-quarter revenue fell 24.7%, and profit plunged nearly 50% year-over-year, as consumers await the new console. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns about potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. on consoles manufactured in Vietnam, which could decrease demand in the U.S. market. The company delayed pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the U.S. after the initial announcement of Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Motown legend Smokey Robinson has refuted allegations of sexual assault made by several former employees. Four female housekeepers filed a lawsuit accusing Robinson of sexual battery including sexual assault, false imprisonment, and labor violations, seeking $50 million in damages. Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, has dismissed the allegations as "vile" and "false," asserting that the lawsuit is an attempt to extort money from the 85-year-old singer. Robinson was Motown's first hitmaker, writing number one hits and being a prominent recording artist himself.</p>

This deal follows closely on the heels of a full free trade agreement between the UK and India, which is projected to significantly boost bilateral trade and UK GDP. The US deal, alluded to by President Trump, is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods, particularly benefiting British steel and car exports, while the US aims for concessions on pharmaceuticals and technology.

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The airport was closed on March 21 after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious. The power outage affected 66,919 customers, and led to the disruption of more than 270,000 journeys. The final report is due by the end of June and is expected to provide answers on what caused the fire.</p>

          <p>Agatha Christie has been reanimated with AI to teach an online writing course with BBC Maestro, raising ethical questions about the use of AI with deceased figures. The course uses a digital prosthetic created with AI and placed over an actor's performance, based on a script derived from Christie's writings and archival interviews. While Christie's family supports the project and emphasizes that it uses her own words, some ethicists argue that it's problematic to represent the views of someone who cannot consent. This case is part of a growing trend of using AI to recreate the voices and likenesses of deceased individuals.</p>
