          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has issued a public health alert for one-pound packages of "ORGANIC RANCHER ORGANIC GROUND BEEF 85% LEAN 15% FAT" due to potential E. coli contamination. The ground beef was produced on May 22 and 23, 2025, and distributed to Whole Foods Market retail locations nationwide, as well as distributor locations in Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, and Maryland. While there have been no confirmed reports of illness, consumers are urged to discard or return the product, as E. coli can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal cramps, with children under 5 and older adults being particularly susceptible to a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).</p>

McCook, who died in a B-25C "Mitchell" crash during a bombing raid over Burma in 1943, have been accounted for. McCook was credited with saving the life of Sgt. John Boyd, who survived the crash and was later captured by Japanese forces, by maneuvering the damaged plane to allow Boyd and another soldier to parachute out. McCook's remains were recovered in 1947 but remained unidentified until recently, and he will be buried in his hometown in August 2025 with a rosette placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures for some of her votes on the Supreme Court, including decisions against President Trump's efforts. Despite this, Trump has publicly defended Barrett, highlighting her intelligence and commitment to interpreting the Constitution as written. While some conservative voices have expressed disappointment, legal scholars note that Barrett has consistently voted conservatively on key issues like abortion and gun rights, and she votes with Justice Kavanaugh 90% of the time. Despite the rumblings, it is not a fair comparison to liken Barrett to the late Justice David Souter.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a massive planet orbiting a small red dwarf star, a pairing that defies current scientific understanding of planet formation. The gas giant planet, named TOI-6894b, has a slightly larger radius than Saturn but only half its mass, and orbits its star in just over three days. This discovery challenges the core accretion theory, as low-mass stars were not thought capable of hosting such large planets, and the planet's unusually cold temperature also intrigues scientists, with the James Webb space telescope scheduled to study it further in the coming year.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging continued surveillance of norovirus outbreaks due to the emergence of a new strain, GII.17, which drove an earlier-than-usual wave of infections last year. With GII.17 now dominant in the U.S., questions arise about whether norovirus season could start early again, as several other countries also experienced shifted waves of the virus. While the CDC is monitoring outbreaks, it cautions that there is insufficient data to definitively link GII.17's emergence to a change in the norovirus season, though shifts in strains typically lead to more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.</p>
