The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a lower rate than the 30% previously proposed by President Trump. As part of the deal, the 27-member EU bloc has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in investments into the United States. The announcement was made following discussions between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have secured their star offensive lineman, Rashawn Slater, with a landmark four-year, $114 million contract extension. This deal makes the two-time Pro Bowl selection the highest-paid offensive lineman in the history of the NFL. The contract reportedly includes $92 million in guaranteed money, reflecting his crucial role as the protector for quarterback Justin Herbert. Slater, a former first-round draft pick, was instrumental last season in helping the Chargers set a franchise record for the fewest offensive turnovers, solidifying his status as a cornerstone of the team.</p>

          <p>Denise Huskins, whose 2015 kidnapping and sexual assault was initially dismissed by Vallejo police as a hoax, is now working with law enforcement agencies to improve how they handle victims. The subject of the Netflix docuseries "American Nightmare," Huskins is now invited to speak to officers about science-based interviewing techniques that prioritize respect and evidence over immediate confessions. This collaboration marks a significant turn in her journey, which she describes as helping to restore her hope after the trauma of both the crime and the subsequent public shaming. She aims to foster better cooperation between victims and police.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has officially won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his victory during the final stage in Paris. While Belgian rider Wout van Aert won the final day's stage on the Champs-Elysees, Pogačar's significant overall lead was never in doubt. With this victory, Pogačar now ties Chris Froome with four Tour wins, placing him among the legends of the sport. He also becomes the first reigning world road champion to win the Tour since Greg LeMond in 1990, capping a dominant performance throughout the three-week race.</p>

          <p>German football champions Bayern Munich have agreed to a deal with Liverpool to sign Colombian forward Luis Diaz for a fee of €75 million (£65.5 million), including add-ons.
