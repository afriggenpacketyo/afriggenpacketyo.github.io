          <p>Gizmo, the second eaglet of Big Bear eagles Jackie and Shadow, successfully took her first flight from the nest, joining her sister Sunny who fledged earlier in the week. The eaglets, born in March, had been preparing for their first flights by practicing flapping their wings and jumping between branches. While it's uncertain where Sunny and Gizmo will go, young eagles typically return to the nest shortly after their first flight. The eaglets will likely remain in the habitat for one to three months, occasionally visiting the nest. The optimism score is not reflected in the summary.</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are warning that excessive scrolling on phones can negatively impact heart health by increasing anxiety, blood pressure, and sedentary behavior. Doomscrolling, especially in the morning or before bed, can disrupt sleep, increase stress, and lead to neglecting heart-healthy habits.
