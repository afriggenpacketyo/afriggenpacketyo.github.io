          <p>Two former traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating inter-bank lending rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court. They were jailed years ago as part of a global scandal surrounding the Libor and Euribor rates, which influence borrowing costs for mortgages and loans. The men argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then normal commercial practice to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis, and this ruling marks a significant vindication after a ten-year fight. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial.</p>

          <p>In the first half of the year, AI startups in the U.S. raised a staggering $104.3 billion, nearly matching the total for all of 2024, with giants like OpenAI and Anthropic leading the charge. Despite this influx of capital, the market for venture capital exits, such as acquisitions and IPOs, tells a different story, with only $36 billion realized from 281 deals. This disparity indicates that while investor appetite for AI is robust, profitable returns are lagging, characterized by frequent but lower-value acquisitions rather than high-value public offerings. Analysts suggest this trend may continue until macroeconomic conditions improve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A shipwreck discovered by a schoolboy on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a storied past. Originally the HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that served during the American War of Independence, it was later sold and repurposed as a whaling ship in the Arctic. The identification was made through a combination of dendrochronology, archival research, and a significant community effort by the island's 500 residents. The ship, which wrecked in 1788 with all crew surviving, is now being preserved as a link to the island's rich maritime history.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Society Must Reconcile Fear and Fact to Coexist with Predators Like Wolves and Bears</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that human policy towards predators is often driven by fear and rare, sensationalized events rather than scientific reality. While conflicts like wolf attacks on livestock occur, they are statistically infrequent, yet they fuel a narrative that justifies widespread extermination efforts. The author points out the ecological importance of keystone species like wolves and highlights the effectiveness of nonlethal management methods, which receive a fraction of federal funding compared to lethal control. The article calls for a reasoned approach to wildlife management that allows for coexistence, protecting both predators and human interests.</p>

          <p>The FireAid benefit concert, held six months ago, raised $100 million for victims of the devastating wildfires in the Pacific Palisades and Altadena, providing a critical lifeline for recovery. The funds have been distributed to numerous non-profits focusing on immediate needs like cash aid, food, and shelter, as well as longer-term challenges such as mental health services and navigating insurance claims. Organizations like the L.A. Regional Food Bank and direct-aid group The Change Reaction used the grants to support thousands of displaced and affected residents. Despite the significant aid, recipients report that the need remains immense as communities grapple with the long road to rebuilding.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, which includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. As part of the deal, U.S. tariffs on Japanese vehicles and auto parts will be reduced from a threatened 25% to 15%, a move welcomed by Japan's Prime Minister. The agreement also reportedly opens Japan's market to some U.S. agricultural products. While touted as a major success by the administration, U.S. automakers have criticized the deal for giving Japanese imports a tariff advantage over parts from Canada and Mexico.

          <p>Beijing has announced that the southern island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs regime by the end of the year, a major step in its transformation into a global free-trade port. This move will allow approximately 6,600 types of goods to enter Hainan with zero tariffs, a dramatic expansion from the current 21%. The new system is a key part of China's "dual circulation" strategy to boost domestic consumption and could serve as a buffer in the trade war with the U.S. Goods with sufficient value-added processing in Hainan will also be able to be sold tariff-free to the rest of mainland China.

However, he expressed cautious optimism that the recently announced U.S.-Japan trade deal could help alleviate some of the uncertainty.

          <p>A new study of skeletons from the 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence of a society centered around women. DNA analysis of remains buried under houses revealed that inhabitants were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This finding, published in the journal Science, confirms long-held archaeological hunches based on female figurines found at the site. The research also found more grave goods buried with women, further suggesting their elevated status in one of the world's oldest known urban settlements.</p>
