          <p>Paxos, the blockchain firm partnered with PayPal, erroneously created $300 trillion worth of the PYUSD stablecoin in a significant technical error. The massive issuance, spotted on the Ethereum blockchain, was the result of a flawed internal transfer. Paxos quickly identified the mistake, burned the excess tokens within approximately 20 minutes, and assured the public that no security breach occurred and customer funds were never at risk. The incident highlights the operational vulnerabilities in stablecoin minting, as the mistaken amount vastly exceeds the total global GDP, underscoring the reliance on human oversight rather than automated guarantees.</p>

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has appointed a virtual artificial intelligence entity named "Diella" as a cabinet minister, a move he claims will usher in an era of transparency and incorruptibility. However, the appointment has drawn sharp criticism and raised constitutional questions, as Albanian law requires ministers to be natural persons capable of bearing legal and political responsibility. Critics argue that Diella is merely a sophisticated chatbot and a political distraction, lacking legal standing and transparency regarding its algorithms and data. The move is seen by some as an attempt to divert attention from debates over government legitimacy rather than a genuine technological advancement in governance.</p>

          <p>Ali Riley, the 37-year-old captain of New Zealand's national soccer team and Angel City FC, is retiring at the end of the season after a celebrated career spanning five World Cups and four Olympics. Her decision follows a challenging year of rehabilitating a chronic nerve injury, undergoing IVF treatment, and losing her childhood home to a fire. Riley reflects on being inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup and expresses pride in her career, especially leading New Zealand to its first-ever World Cup victory on home soil in 2023. She plans to remain involved in women's sports through media and advocacy, aiming to support its continued growth.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 1103, legislation designed to accelerate the study of psychedelic drugs for treating PTSD, depression, and traumatic brain injury among veterans. Backed by veteran advocacy groups, the bill streamlines the approval process by targeting the Research Advisory Panel of California, which has historically added delays to FDA-approved studies. The new law will allow a smaller group of panel members to approve compliant studies more quickly, removing a significant roadblock to research. Proponents, including former Navy SEALs who credit psychedelics with saving their lives, hail the move as a pivotal moment for advancing mental health treatment options.</p>

          <p>Experts are urging Californians to participate in the annual ShakeOut earthquake drill, emphasizing the importance of the "Drop, Cover, and Hold On" technique. With 70% of the state's population living near an active fault, officials stress that a major earthquake is inevitable. The article debunks the myth of running outside, noting that falling debris makes the area just outside buildings one of the most dangerous places during a quake. It also provides practical advice on securing homes, retrofitting older buildings to prevent collapse, and utilizing the MyShake app for early warnings, aiming to mitigate injuries and damage when the next significant seismic event occurs.</p>

          <h2>French Prime Minister Survives No-Confidence Vote After Pledging to Suspend Pension Reform</h2>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government has survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, securing its immediate future. The motion, initiated by the hard-left France Unbowed party, failed to achieve the required 289-vote majority, gaining only 271. Lecornu's strategic promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's highly contentious pension reform until after the 2027 presidential election was crucial in winning the support of Socialist lawmakers. While the government avoided collapse, the narrow margin underscores the fragility of Macron's ruling coalition and the deep political divisions within the National Assembly, signaling continued challenges for his administration.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying proteins that trigger programmed cell death, a process crucial for health but which goes awry in diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. Scientists at the Stowers Institute have focused on how certain immune cells self-destruct upon detecting a threat by forming a structure called a "death fold" polymer. They theorize this process releases energy similarly to a reusable hand warmer crystallizing. Understanding this mechanism could lead to new treatments; for instance, preventing these proteins from activating in brain cells could help Alzheimer's patients, while encouraging their activation in tumor cells could fight cancer, offering hope for currently intractable diseases.</p>

          <p>The Virginia gubernatorial election is being influenced by two major issues: the federal government shutdown's impact on the state's large federal workforce and a scandal involving violent text messages sent by the Democratic candidate for Attorney General. Democrat Abigail Spanberger is leveraging voter frustration over the shutdown and job cuts, which are seen as a liability for Republicans. Meanwhile, Republican Winsome Earle-Sears is capitalizing on the text message scandal to energize conservative voters and question Democratic leadership. The race, often viewed as a national political barometer, is also seeing debates over transgender student policies in schools, adding another layer of complexity to the contest.</p>

          <p>The concept of making public buses free is gaining traction in cities like New York, but transit advocates are divided on whether it is the most effective policy. Proponents argue that eliminating fares increases accessibility, speeds up boarding times, and encourages more people to use public transit instead of cars. However, skeptics suggest that riders prioritize service frequency and reliability over cost, and that funds would be better spent on improving infrastructure and running more buses. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after failing to find a sustainable funding source, highlight the financial and logistical challenges of implementing a fare-free system.</p>

The company noted that consumption in mainland China grew by mid-to-high single digits in the third quarter, approaching stabilization. However, LVMH's CFO warned that a full rebound will still take time, given ongoing challenges in China's property sector and high youth unemployment, which continue to temper consumer spending.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from laying off thousands of federal workers during the government shutdown. The ruling came after two major unions filed a lawsuit, arguing the administration was unlawfully using the funding lapse to downsize the government for political reasons. The judge cited public statements by President Trump and his budget chief as evidence of these motivations. The administration had already begun issuing layoff notices to about 4,000 employees at agencies like the Treasury and Health and Human Services, with plans to cut over 10,000 workers in total during the shutdown.</p>

          <p>Cardiff may become the first city in the UK to implement a parking permit surcharge for large vehicles like SUVs and those with high emissions. The proposal is part of a new 10-year parking plan aimed at reducing traffic congestion, cutting air pollution, and encouraging the use of public transport, cycling, and walking. The plan would also restructure the city into three new parking zones, eliminate new resident permits in the city center, and reduce the number of permits available to students. While the council says the changes will create a healthier city, some students have raised concerns about safety if they are unable to park near their homes.</p>
