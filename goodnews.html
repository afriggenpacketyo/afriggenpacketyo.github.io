          <p>China has launched the Tianwen-2 space probe to collect samples from the asteroid 2016 HO3, also known as 469219 Kamo ªoalewa, near Mars. The 10-year plan includes the "Tianwen-3" Mars sampling return mission in 2028 and the "Tianwen-4" mission to Jupiter. The asteroids, chosen for their stable orbits, may offer clues about Earth's formation, such as the origins of water. NASA is restricted from cooperation with the CNSA due to the Wolf Amendment, preventing them from receiving any samples. China's continued space exploration efforts are giving them a step in the right direction to becoming a major force in space exploration.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, releasing the bees into the surrounding area. Authorities have warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for bee swarms, and roads have been closed as bee experts help with the cleanup. The plan is to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen bee, with the goal of saving as many of the bees as possible. Honeybees play a key role in pollination and food production, and this accident raises concerns about their well-being and the potential impact on agriculture.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump lauded Nippon Steel Corp. for committing to invest $14 billion in United States Steel Corp. and protect American workers' jobs, calling the Japanese company a "great partner." Trump also announced an increase in tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent and said Nippon Steel's investment is the largest in Pennsylvania's history. He stated that U.S. Steel would maintain all its existing blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of 10 years. The deal, which was previously blocked by the Biden administration, has been touted as a way to ensure the survival and growth of U.S. Steel.</p>

          <p>President Trump touted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Japanese company Nippon Steel, claiming it would keep the steelmaker in Pittsburgh and promising no layoffs or outsourcing. Trump said Nippon would invest $14 billion, including funds to increase steel production in Pittsburgh and modernize mills in other states, and promised a $5,000 bonus for steelworkers. He emphasized that U.S. Steel would remain "controlled by the USA," though he later admitted he hadn't seen the final details.

          <p>An appeals court refused to freeze a judge's order halting the Trump administration from downsizing the federal workforce, keeping Department of Government Efficiency-led cuts on hold. The court ruled that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration had sought to overturn an injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by labor unions and cities questioning the legality of the workforce reductions. The judge's order directs federal agencies to halt acting on the president's workforce executive order and a subsequent memo issued by DOGE and the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

          <p>China has completed its first overseas new-generation radio telescope in northern Thailand, enhancing a global scientific network to monitor deep space signals and track Earth's shifts. The 13-meter radio antenna, developed with Thailand, will improve deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring for more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting. A second telescope is under construction in southern Thailand, and the project began with a memorandum of understanding in 2017. The Chiang Mai telescope has already completed a full 24-hour observation session, meeting expected precision benchmarks.</p>

The review will recommend deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control unmanned weapons. New money for defense will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%.</p>

          <p>Rugby league authorities express disappointment over the lack of knighthoods or damehoods for their players in 130 years, citing potential snobbery and class prejudice. The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, supports the call for recognition, noting the sport's long and proud history. A cross-party group of MPs suggests the lack of honors is due to the working-class backgrounds of rugby league players compared to the more middle-class roots of rugby union, which has received knighthoods for over a century. Pressure is mounting for the honors system to acknowledge the achievements and contributions of rugby league stars.</p>

The astronauts successfully docked after Mission Control helped restart the thrusters, but the possibility of never seeing Earth again crossed their minds. They eventually returned to Earth on a SpaceX capsule, while Boeing maintained that its own capsule was safe.</p>
