          <p>Hong Kong's financial sector is experiencing a resurgence, driven by China's strong economy and the shifting balance of power between the U.S. and China. As the U.S. faces economic challenges, capital is flowing to Asia, benefiting Hong Kong's stock market. The city is increasingly used as a platform for Chinese tech companies to raise funds, solidifying its position as a leading fundraising hub. Government policies have further bolstered Hong Kong's role as a global financial center, but it remains to be seen whether the benefits will spread to other sectors. </p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from ICE detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release, and he has since returned to New Jersey. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. He was greeted by friends and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who condemned his detainment as a violation of his First Amendment rights. The judge ruled that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk, but the government may continue deportation proceedings. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling struck down a policy change that would have capped indirect costs for universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually. The judge deemed the change arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law, protecting critical research in various technology fields. </p>

The evacuations began hours before President Trump announced U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. The announcement follows earlier confusion regarding U.S. government assistance for American citizens evacuating from Israel. The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory, urging Americans not to travel there. </p>

          <p>The pop-punk band South Arcade draws inspiration from Y2K core, a growing interest in 90s and early 2000s culture. The band's music, which blends rock and pop elements, reflects the sound of that era. South Arcade gained traction on TikTok, where the Y2K hashtag has been used in millions of posts. The appeal of Y2K core stems from a desire for escapism and a longing for a time when personal expression was more tangible. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC explores the issue of stress hormones and the effectiveness of social media's quick fixes for lowering cortisol levels. Experts warn that these simplistic solutions fail to address the underlying causes of stress and may prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment. While mindfulness and other techniques can help regulate stress responses, sudden body changes should be checked by a medical professional to rule out any physical health problems. Addressing the cause of stress, such as relationship or financial worries, is more effective than treating the symptoms. </p>
