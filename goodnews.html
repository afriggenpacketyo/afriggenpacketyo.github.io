          <h2>Paleontologists Discover New 3-Eyed Sea Predator from Cambrian Period</h2>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, part of the extinct radiodont group, had a pencil sharpener-like mouth and was about the length of an index finger. The discovery reveals that the Mosura had a more complex body structure than previously known for radiodonts, with a multi-segmented abdomen and specialized gills. The well-preserved fossil also showed the creature's open circulatory system.</p>
