        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, a look back at the Great Wall Film Company, one of the first Chinese American film studios, founded in Brooklyn in the 1920s due to unfair portrayals in early Hollywood. Chinese leaders, frustrated by demeaning stereotypes, were encouraged to create their own movies. Harold Lee and his uncle Lee Kee Do established the studio, reflecting a 'do-it-yourself' mentality within the Chinese-American community. The studio later moved to Shanghai, but the Lee family continued to impact cinema through the New York Chinese Film Exchange.</p>

          <p>UNC athletic director Lawrence R. "Bubba" Cunningham avoided directly addressing concerns about whether Bill Belichick's girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, creates distractions for the football team. Cunningham praised Belichick's professionalism and focus but sidestepped questions about Hudson's involvement, simply stating that Belichick is incredibly focused. Belichick himself stated that his relationship with Hudson is personal and doesn't affect UNC football. Hudson has faced scrutiny for her reported influence on HBO's decision to not feature UNC on "Hard Knocks."</p>
