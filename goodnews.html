          <h2>Happiness Researcher Explains the "90-Second Rule" for Managing Negative Emotions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google X executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage difficult emotions like anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule suggests allowing oneself a minute and a half for the physiological response to an emotion to pass before consciously choosing to shift focus. Gawdat, who began writing about happiness after the tragic death of his son, explains that this brief period allows stress hormones to flush from the system. He pairs this with a three-question framework to challenge negative thoughts, promoting a more fulfilled and resilient mindset.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 09:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inspired by the Danish emphasis on hobbies for well-being, Emory University professor Marina Cooley undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from pottery to pickleball. She found that dedicating time to these pursuits fundamentally changed her life, helping her overcome doomscrolling, reduce loneliness, and redefine self-care beyond passive consumption. Cooley argues that engaging in hobbies forces individuals to set boundaries with work and other obligations, leading to better balance and confidence. The experience convinced her that actively pursuing hobbies is a key secret to happiness, rather than something to be postponed until balance is found.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of Census Bureau data reveals that Florida was the most popular state for Americans aged 60 and over to move to in 2023, attracting a net gain of over 44,500 new residents in that age group. This figure, while the highest in the nation, represents a significant decrease from the previous year. North Carolina and Arizona followed as the next most popular destinations for retirees. Florida's appeal is often attributed to its lack of state income, estate, or inheritance taxes, as well as its sunny weather and numerous recreational opportunities for seniors.

          <p>In the Utah desert, the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) provides a high-fidelity analog environment for scientists and researchers to prepare for future human missions to Mars. Run by the nonprofit Mars Society, the facility hosts small crews who live for weeks under simulated Martian protocols, including wearing mock spacesuits for "extravehicular activities." A recent crew described their daily routine of planning, research, and outdoor excursions in the Mars-like terrain. The experience is designed to test procedures and understand the psychological and logistical challenges of living and working in an isolated, extreme environment.</p>

          <p>This article compiles several perspectives on the meaning of physical movement, arguing for a shift away from the singular goal of weight loss. It suggests that many people have a negative association with exercise due to its link with diet culture. Finding a form of movement that is genuinely enjoyable, whether it's weightlifting, running, or group fitness, can lead to a more positive body image and improved mental health. The piece posits that in an era of weight-loss drugs, understanding the intrinsic benefits of working out for physical and mental well-being is more important than ever.</p>

          <p>The mortality rate from heart attacks in the U.S. has plummeted by nearly 90% since 1970, transforming a once-common death sentence into a much more survivable event. This dramatic progress is attributed to a combination of factors, including successful public health campaigns against smoking and the development of life-saving drugs like statins. Advances in emergency response, such as widespread CPR and portable defibrillators, along with improved hospital treatments like angioplasty and stents, have also saved millions of lives. Despite this success, heart disease remains a leading cause of death, with rising rates of obesity and diabetes posing new challenges.</p>

The report suggests that the "technical" aspects of the negotiations are largely complete, with a final deal now depending on the "political will" from the EU side. This development comes after a period of heightened trade tensions, during which the EU has launched multiple investigations into Chinese trade practices.

A key try from Alex Mitchell provided the necessary cushion for the tourists to secure their third consecutive win in Australia.

After waking with a headache, blurred vision, and numbness, he was rushed to the hospital where doctors gave him a 15% chance of survival. Quick action by the medical team, who administered a clot-busting drug, saved his life, but he faced a long and arduous recovery. He had to relearn how to speak and swallow through intensive therapy, a journey he describes as even tougher than surviving the stroke itself.</p>

The movement, known as "Kill the Drill," formed in response to a state permit granted for exploratory drilling in the ecologically vital Apalachicola River basin. Spurred by memories of the economic devastation caused by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill threat, the coalition pushed for permanent protection.

          <p>The Apple TV+ series "Murderbot," based on Martha Wells' novella, offers a novel take on artificial intelligence by featuring a protagonist that has no desire to be human. The show follows a security cyborg that hacks its own governing module to achieve free will, only to use its autonomy to secretly watch soap operas. Unlike many sci-fi narratives where AI seeks humanity, Murderbot finds human emotions and interactions messy and prefers to be treated as a machine. This premise provides a quirky and insightful departure from typical AI stories, questioning the assumption that an advanced consciousness would want to emulate its creators.</p>
