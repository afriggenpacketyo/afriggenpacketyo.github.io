          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis followed reports of increasing urinary symptoms and the discovery of a nodule during a routine physical exam. While the cancer is aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Biden and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians, amidst scrutiny over his health since before he left the presidential race in 2024.</p>
