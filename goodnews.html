          <p>Wales ended their Rugby World Cup campaign without a victory after losing a competitive match to Fiji in Exeter. Both teams entered the final Pool B game seeking their first win, leading to an entertaining, high-scoring contest. Fiji established a lead with tries from Josifini Neihamu and others, and despite a late surge from Wales, held on for a deserved victory. The result was particularly meaningful for Fiji's head coach, Ioan Cunningham, who previously had a controversial departure from his role with the Welsh team. For Wales, the whitewash marks a disappointing end to their tournament.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, setting the fastest lap in Formula 1 history with a time of one minute and 18.792 seconds. His performance, averaging over 164 mph, narrowly edged out McLaren's Lando Norris, who had momentarily topped the timesheets. Verstappen's teammate Oscar Piastri qualified third, followed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton, however, faces a five-place grid penalty, which will move him to tenth for the start of the race, promoting Mercedes' George Russell to fifth position.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the site for his presidential library and museum. A 13-person governance board, including former senior aides like Antony Blinken and Steve Ricchetti, has been appointed to oversee the project. The decision affirms Biden's deep political roots in Delaware, where his career began and which he represented in the Senate for 36 years. The library's foundation faces the significant challenge of fundraising in a divided political climate, with costs for such projects often running into hundreds of millions of dollars, as seen with previous presidential libraries.</p>

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at Point Reyes National Seashore as 12 dairy and cattle operations have accepted a multi-million dollar buyout to cease operations on the land. This agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a large-scale, five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The project will use targeted cattle grazing, mowing, and prescribed burns to control invasive plants and encourage the regrowth of native species. While the transition marks the end of a long history of ranching in the area, conservationists hope it will create a resilient landscape and a model for ecological restoration.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their allies participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, an event seen as a significant step toward inclusion within the Catholic Church. The pilgrimage, officially listed on the Vatican's Jubilee calendar, included a Mass celebrated by a senior Italian bishop who emphasized restoring dignity to marginalized groups. Many participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, which they feel is being continued under his successor, Pope Leo XIV.

          <p>Schools across the United States are implementing locked magnetic pouches, such as those from the company Yondr, to enforce new statewide cellphone bans in classrooms. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches, which they carry with them but can only be unlocked using special magnetic devices at school entrances. The policy aims to reduce distractions and improve student engagement, with educators reporting a more positive and interactive classroom environment. While some students have welcomed the change, others have expressed frustration, and districts face costs of $25-30 per student for the system.</p>

Launched in May 2024, the app has quickly grown to 30 employees and generates approximately $1.4 million in gross profit per month. Yadegari, who learned to code at age seven, developed the app to solve the tedious problem of manual calorie tracking. Now a freshman at the University of Miami, he anticipates leaving college early to focus on his business full-time and pursue a career in serial entrepreneurship.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's focus on crime in cities like Chicago and Baltimore, an analysis of recent crime data reveals a different picture. The four large cities with the highest murder rates in 2024 are all located in Republican-led states: Jackson, Mississippi; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Louis, Missouri; and Memphis, Tennessee. While Trump has labeled Chicago the "world's most dangerous city," its homicide rate is significantly lower than these cities and is on pace for a substantial decline this year. The report highlights that violent crime has been falling nationwide, with the sharpest decreases occurring in large urban centers.</p>

          <p>Beijing is intensifying its anti-corruption campaign within the financial sector, a move that analysts believe will ultimately bolster long-term confidence and attract foreign investment. The investigation of a high-profile figure from a major state-owned financial group signals the campaign's expansion from banking into the stock market. While the crackdown may cause short-term uncertainty, it addresses the demand from international institutions for cleaner governance and a more transparent market. This effort is seen as a crucial step toward establishing a more stable and trustworthy financial environment in China.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of 14 individuals believed to be soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal conflicts. The discovery in South Carolina has launched what experts are calling "the ultimate cold case," using forensic genealogy to identify the forgotten soldiers. By creating genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones and comparing them to living descendants, researchers hope to restore their names and honor their sacrifice. The team is now asking people with family names connected to the Maryland region during that era to submit DNA to aid the identification process.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second national test of the emergency alert system this Sunday, sending a message to millions of mobile phones around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public about life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. The first test in April 2023 experienced technical difficulties, with some users receiving multiple alerts and others none at all. The government has since worked to fix these issues. Users can opt out of receiving the alerts through their phone's settings, though officials strongly recommend keeping them enabled for safety.</p>

          <p>Elliott Investment Management, an activist investor with a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, has outlined a plan to boost the company's performance, which has lagged behind competitors. The proposal urges PepsiCo to refranchise its bottling network, streamline its extensive product portfolio by divesting underperforming brands like Quaker, and reinvest in core brands such as Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Elliott argues these strategic shifts could unlock significant value, potentially increasing shareholder returns by over 50%. The plan focuses on long-term growth through reinvestment rather than short-term measures like stock buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book showcases the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese Jewish émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz scene, capturing both the rapturous joy of audiences and the profound wariness of the musicians themselves, including icons like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis. The project was ultimately abandoned due to McCarthy-era suspicion of her politics, leaving behind nearly 1,800 negatives. The images reveal a deep connection between Model, who fled Nazi persecution, and her subjects, who faced racism and violence in America.</p>
