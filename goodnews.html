          <p>Eastside Brewing Co. in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, has received overwhelming public support after announcing a policy to bar children after 7 p.m. and prohibit unaccompanied teenagers. The brewery stated on Facebook that its space is designed for adults consuming alcohol, not as a playground, citing issues with unsupervised children. Despite some negative feedback from a minority of customers, the post went viral with hundreds of commenters praising the decision and pledging their patronage. The brewery's management emphasized that while families are welcome, the environment is primarily intended for adults to enjoy a pint.</p>

After starting as a taxi driver and eventually running his own fleet, he pivoted to open Dandies Barbershop & Beard Stylist, which now has three locations. Singh overcame significant challenges, including going into debt to keep the barbershop afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. He attributes his resilience and strong work ethic to his upbringing in Punjab, India. Now 38, Singh continues to work long hours and is developing a third business, a scheduling app for barbers.</p>

          <p>Oni Press has announced a new expanded and annotated edition of Maia Kobabe’s award-winning graphic memoir, “Gender Queer,” scheduled for release next May. The book, which chronicles Kobabe's journey of self-discovery with gender and sexuality, has become one of the most challenged and banned books in the United States amid a politically hostile climate toward the LGBTQ+ community. This special hardcover edition will feature commentary from Kobabe, as well as contributions from other comic creators, scholars, and individuals depicted in the memoir. The author hopes the new edition provides a richer text and deeper context for readers, educators, and fans.</p>

          <h2>Poll Shows California Democrats Favor Newsom Over Harris for 2028 Presidential Run</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a large number of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, with more backing him than former Vice President Kamala Harris. Among the state's voters overall, however, opinions on a Newsom candidacy are more divided. The poll also indicates that while Californians view their state as a leader in technology and culture, they see it as a poor example in housing, tax, and economic policy. Newsom's approval rating as governor remains positive, but many voters feel he is more focused on national issues than local ones.</p>

          <p>Shares of Finnish telecom equipment company Nokia jumped significantly despite missing third-quarter revenue expectations. The stock's rise was fueled by strong incoming orders, particularly from cloud computing and artificial intelligence data center operators investing heavily in optical networking infrastructure. This robust order book signals stronger revenue potential in future quarters and reflects Nokia's successful transition from a pure telecommunications focus to a more diversified networking company. The company's earnings per share met analyst expectations, further bolstering investor confidence in its strategic shift towards the booming AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen for the second consecutive week to 6.19%, approaching a three-year low and creating a potential window for prospective homebuyers. However, experts advise a cautious approach, as rates are still significantly higher than in previous years and home prices remain elevated. While further Federal Reserve rate cuts are anticipated, they are expected to be gradual, and unforeseen economic factors could cause rates to reverse their downward trend. Acting now could help buyers avoid potentially increased competition during the traditional spring homebuying season if rates continue to fall into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent sharp fluctuations in the price of gold, driven by competing factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and a stronger stock market, are creating opportunities for investors. The article suggests several ways to capitalize on this volatility, such as trading the stocks of gold mining companies, which often have leveraged movements relative to the price of gold itself. For short-term plays, investors can use gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts to trade price movements directly. For those with a long-term strategy, buying physical gold during price dips remains a viable option to hedge against broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Parenting experts are offering insights into common toddler behaviors, explaining that actions like constantly saying "no," claiming everything as "mine," and resisting transitions are normal parts of development. Pediatric psychologist Roger Harrison notes that these behaviors are how young children establish their independence and sense of self. Rather than viewing these actions as defiance, parents are encouraged to reframe them as crucial social and emotional learning. The article provides practical tips, such as offering positive choices to give toddlers a sense of agency and modeling desired behaviors like sharing, to help navigate this challenging but important stage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed plans to deploy federal agents to San Francisco after receiving phone calls from tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. In a social media post, Trump stated that he was convinced to hold off on the deployment because local leaders were making "substantial progress" on crime. The decision is seen as a political victory for San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who had argued against a military-style presence in the city. The potential deployment had become a flashpoint, with some tech executives initially supporting it before backtracking amid public criticism.</p>
