          <p>Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta infringed upon the freedom of expression of porn star Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account, which had over five million followers. The court found that Meta's action lacked a clear justification and that the company applied its policies on nudity inconsistently, as similar accounts remained active. The ruling orders Meta to revise its terms of use to provide clearer mechanisms for users to challenge moderation decisions. This decision highlights a growing trend in South America where courts are holding social media platforms more accountable for their content policies.</p>

          <p>England and Scotland are set to face each other in a Women's Rugby World Cup quarter-final, renewing a rivalry that has been overwhelmingly dominated by England for over 25 years. Scotland's last victory against the Red Roses was in 1999, with the gap between the teams widening since then due to England's superior investment, structure, and larger player pool. Despite the historical dominance, Scotland has shown significant improvement, rising to sixth in world rankings. This article explores the history of the matchup and the factors contributing to the current disparity, while noting the Scottish team's belief in their ability to challenge the tournament favorites.</p>

          <p>Boxing analysts are divided on the outcome of the highly anticipated match between Saúl “Canelo” Álvarez and Terence “Bud” Crawford, highlighting a classic clash of power versus technical skill. Crawford's supporters believe his superior boxing intelligence, adaptability, and reach advantage will allow him to outpoint Álvarez, despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, those backing Álvarez argue that his size, power, and experience at the 168lb limit will prove insurmountable for Crawford. The fight's intrigue lies in whether Crawford's flawless technique can overcome the significant physical advantages held by the Mexican superstar.</p>

          <p>Following days of deadly anti-corruption protests that led to the collapse of the government, Nepal has sworn in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its first female interim prime minister. The youth-led "GenZ" demonstrations, which saw the parliament set ablaze, were initially sparked by a social media ban but grew to encompass broader economic frustrations. With Karki's appointment, calm has returned to Kathmandu, and new elections have been scheduled for March 5. Her leadership is seen as a step toward stability and addressing the graft concerns that fueled the widespread public unrest.</p>

          <p>In a dual effort to boost its birth rate and strengthen its scientific workforce, Shanghai has introduced a new subsidy program for female researchers. The initiative provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (US$7,010) to new mothers under 40 with doctoral degrees who are returning to their scientific careers. Initially targeting 20 researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the program aims to alleviate the professional challenges women face after childbirth. This policy reflects a targeted approach by Chinese authorities to simultaneously address demographic concerns and the need for high-level scientific talent.</p>

          <h2>Cristiano Ronaldo's Potential US Return Analyzed Amid World Cup Preparations</h2>

          <p>This article explores the potential for Cristiano Ronaldo to return to the United States for the first time in over a decade, a development that could coincide with the upcoming World Cup. His long absence from the major US market has been conspicuous, coinciding with sexual assault allegations that emerged in 2017, which he has always denied. A potential friendly match between Portugal and the US next year is seen as a test of the waters. The piece suggests a changing political climate under Donald Trump, who has shown admiration for Ronaldo, might facilitate this return, which would be a major branding opportunity for both the player and FIFA.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships have commenced in Tokyo, with athletes facing grueling heat and humidity, as temperatures climbed to 30°C with over 90% humidity during the opening events. The challenging conditions impacted the 35km race walk, where several competitors struggled, and organizers have already moved marathon start times earlier to mitigate health risks. Despite the weather, Japan celebrated an early success with a bronze medal in the men's race walk, delighting the home crowd. The event marks a significant return of major international sports with spectators to the city, four years after the fan-less 2020 Olympics.</p>

          <p>In a stunning high school football game, Corona Centennial defeated the top-ranked Mater Dei Monarchs 43-36, marking Mater Dei's first loss to a Southern Section team other than St. John Bosco in a decade. Centennial dominated early, leading 28-0 after the first quarter, driven by a strong defense that forced multiple turnovers. Although Mater Dei staged a dramatic comeback to take the lead in the third quarter, Centennial rallied in the fourth to secure the victory. The win was particularly meaningful for Centennial's McKinley and Catalano brothers, whose older siblings led the team to its last victory over Mater Dei ten years ago.</p>

          <p>Line dancing is shedding its old-fashioned image and enjoying a resurgence in popularity, driven by a new generation of enthusiasts and social media platforms like TikTok.

Participants note that classes are now attracting younger crowds and that the dance style has diversified, with routines set to a wide range of musical genres beyond country. This revival is transforming the perception of line dancing from a niche hobby for older adults into a cool, mainstream activity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article by Rebecca Solnit uses the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album as a lens to examine the historical normalization of sexual exploitation of young girls. Solnit argues that the culture of the 1970s and 80s, reflected in films, music, and societal attitudes, frequently excused or even celebrated relationships between adult men and underage girls. She credits the rise of feminism with fundamentally shifting public consciousness by establishing principles of consent, power dynamics, and the rights of women and children. The article posits that Epstein's actions were a product of an era before these feminist ideas became mainstream.</p>
