        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Supreme Court has limited the scope for widespread compensation claims related to undisclosed commissions in car finance deals. The court dismissed the argument that such commissions constituted illegal secret payments or that dealers had a primary duty of loyalty to customers. However, the ruling did uphold one claim under the Consumer Credit Act, deeming a particularly large and misleading commission as "unfair." This specific case may still allow for claims where commission arrangements were egregious. Analysts suggest that while the potential liability for lenders has been significantly reduced from tens of billions, it could still amount to several billion pounds, particularly concerning a separate investigation into Discretionary Commission Agreements by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has issued a ruling that blocks the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The decision could significantly curtail the administration's mass deportation campaign, particularly an operation involving arrests at immigration courts. Under this practice, ICE agents would detain migrants after their court hearings to place them in expedited removal, a much quicker process than standard court proceedings. The judge found the practice illegal, emphasizing that the migrants in question had followed the rules by entering with government permission and attending their hearings, raising a "question of fair play."</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to lock in currently high returns with long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests savers should determine the maximum amount they can comfortably deposit for an extended period to capitalize on these rates. It also advises using this period of rate stability to shop around, particularly at online banks, which often offer more competitive rates than traditional institutions. Finally, individuals are encouraged to re-evaluate where their other savings are held, as moving funds from lower-yield accounts into a high-rate CD could significantly boost earnings over time.

          <p>After a significant run-up in price over the past year, gold may face a period of stagnation in August. The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates on hold removes a key catalyst for price movement, as rate changes often drive investors toward or away from the precious metal. Furthermore, with mixed signals on inflation and stock market performance, the demand for gold as a diversification tool could evolve. While some indicators could push the price higher, there are equally strong signs pointing to a potential decline or plateau. This article suggests investors should focus on gold's long-term role in a portfolio rather than short-term price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decision by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) has created a significant legal obstacle for Italy's controversial plan to process asylum seekers in offshore centers in Albania. The court ruled that Italy's method for designating a country as "safe" for returns is inconsistent with EU law. This concept is central to the Albania deal, which relied on quickly processing and deporting applicants from such countries. The ECJ stated that a country can only be listed as safe if the entire population is protected, a standard that will force Italy to revise its procedures. The ruling was hailed by human rights groups as a collapse of the plan's legal core.</p>

          <p>A baby boy has been born from an embryo that was frozen for nearly 31 years, believed to be the longest storage time to result in a live birth. An Ohio couple, Linda and Tim Pierce, used an embryo donated in 1994 through a process known as embryo adoption. The donor, who had leftover embryos from her own IVF treatment decades ago, chose an open adoption process to find a home for them, stating she felt they "deserved to live." The case highlights the growing number of frozen embryos in storage and the complex ethical and emotional decisions faced by families, a topic further complicated by recent legal debates over the status of embryos.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma surged again on their second day of trading, following a massive debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which priced its IPO shares at $33, saw its stock close at $115.50 on Thursday, a 250% gain. The successful launch marks a significant moment for the tech IPO market, which has seen a recent revival with several other companies going public. Figma's strong performance comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was called off in 2023 due to regulatory opposition, forcing the company to pursue a path as a standalone public entity.</p>

          <p>While Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remain high due to the Federal Reserve's paused interest rates, they have declined from their peaks a year ago. A comparison shows that a $10,000 deposit in August 2024 would have earned more interest across various terms than the same deposit made today. For example, a 3-year CD opened last year would have earned over $500 more than one opened now. Despite the lower returns compared to 2024, the article notes that CDs still offer a compelling option for savers, as their fixed rates provide security against potential future rate cuts that would affect variable-rate accounts.

The incident is the latest in a series of tense moments in the closely fought series. England's assistant coach acknowledged India's plan to unsettle Root, noting it was a different approach for a player who usually laughs off such confrontations.</p>

          <p>The NFL is expected to take an ownership stake in ESPN as part of a significant deal with parent company Walt Disney Co. In exchange for equity, ESPN is anticipated to take over the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the popular Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership would give the NFL a financial interest in one of its major broadcast partners, potentially reshaping future media rights negotiations with other networks like Fox, NBC, and CBS. The move comes as both entities navigate the changing media landscape, with ESPN facing declining cable subscriptions and the NFL seeking to maximize the value of its highly-demanded content.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the legality of killing snakes in South Carolina, a state home to several venomous species, including the copperhead. According to state law, it is illegal to kill any snake on public land, and doing so is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine or jail time. While residents have the right to kill a snake on their private property if they feel threatened, experts advise against it, as most bites occur during such attempts. Instead, they recommend spraying the snake with a water hose to encourage it to leave. The article also highlights the crucial ecological role snakes play as both predators and prey, helping to control pest populations.</p>

          <p>A debate over Germany's pension system has been reignited, with the Economy Minister suggesting people need to "work more and longer" to ensure its sustainability. With a rapidly aging population and a shrinking ratio of workers to pensioners, the system is under immense financial pressure. The proposal to raise the retirement age beyond 67 was met with immediate backlash from coalition partners and trade unions, who argue it unfairly penalizes workers in physically demanding jobs. Experts note that while raising the retirement age is one option, other reforms like expanding the contribution base or incentivizing private pensions are also crucial but politically contentious.</p>

          <p>The Presidential Fitness Test, a staple of American physical education for over 50 years, is set to make a comeback after being discontinued in 2013. President Trump signed an executive order to revive the standardized set of exercises, which measured student fitness through drills like the one-mile run and push-ups. The administration cited declining physical well-being and rising obesity rates as a threat to the nation's vitality. While specifics of the new test are yet to be determined, its revival has drawn a mixed response from educators, who agree on the problem of childhood inactivity but question whether a standardized test is the most effective solution.</p>
