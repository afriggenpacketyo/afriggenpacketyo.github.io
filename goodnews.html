          <p>Antonio Filosa, the incoming CEO of Stellantis, aims to revitalize the automaker by drawing inspiration from Sergio Marchionne and addressing financial issues, strained relationships, and investment plans. Filosa, who previously headed Stellantis' Americas operations, is tasked with mending bonds with dealers, politicians, and employees damaged during Carlos Tavares' tenure. Stellantis' global sales have declined, and the company faces challenges in transitioning to electric vehicles.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A regulation that took effect in 2021, focused on organ procurement organizations (OPOs), led to a significant increase in pancreata collected for research purposes. This surge is attributed to a rule that allowed pancreata used for research to count towards OPO recertification, creating a "pancreas loophole." While this has increased the number of pancreata available for research, critics argue that it incentivizes OPOs to prioritize research pancreata over those needed for transplants. Congress is now considering whether to modify the 2004 law that led to this unintended consequence, possibly by clarifying the status of islet cells for transplantation.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, preserving the state's billion-dollar industry of THC-infused products. The bill would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture, or sell consumable THC products, a move criticized for restricting access to goods that provide similar relief to marijuana. Critics argued that the ban would disproportionately affect those unable to access marijuana through the state's limited medical program. The veto allows the market to continue operating under existing regulations, which lack federal oversight but provide access to legal alternatives to marijuana.</p>

NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to manage demand and resources, with plans to expand availability in phases over the next few years. The weekly injection, which helps people feel full and eat less, will be accompanied by wrap-around care, including regular check-ups and support with exercise. Some GP practices have cautioned that very few patients will initially qualify, and training is needed for healthcare staff to safely administer the drug.</p>
