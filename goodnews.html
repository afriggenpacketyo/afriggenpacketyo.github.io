          <p>Shareholders of Seven & i Holdings Co., the Japanese operator of the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain, approved Stephen Hayes Dacus as its first foreign CEO. Dacus aims to achieve faster growth in the next decade by focusing on the convenience store business, which has seen slowing growth in Japan and the United States. The company is currently examining a buyout offer of around 7 trillion yen ($49 billion) from Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc., the operator of the Circle K convenience stores, while also considering restructuring measures to boost corporate value. Seven & i plans to sell its supermarket business and list its U.S. 7-Eleven business unit in the U.S. in 2026.</p>

Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake reviews.
