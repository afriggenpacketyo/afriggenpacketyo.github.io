          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough in electromagnetic coilgun technology, achieving a firing rate of 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and existing US commercial models. The breakthrough centers on eliminating capacitors, a limiting factor in previous electromagnetic weapons, by powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. This innovation is detailed in China‚Äôs Journal of Gun Launch & Control and could redefine future combat capabilities.</p>
