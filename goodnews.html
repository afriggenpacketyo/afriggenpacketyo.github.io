          <p>Hurricane Erin has intensified into a Category 2 storm, with maximum sustained winds reaching 100 mph. The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands, warning of potential flooding and landslides from heavy rainfall. While the storm is expected to become a major Category 3 hurricane over the weekend, forecasts indicate it will likely turn northeast, passing between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda. The threat of a direct impact on the Bahamas and the United States appears to be decreasing, though Bermuda may experience closer effects.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. The meeting aims to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war, which Trump framed as a more durable solution than a ceasefire. The announcement came after the Alaska talks concluded without a formal deal, though Trump described them as "extremely productive." Zelenskyy has previously insisted that any negotiations must include Ukraine and cannot involve ceding territory, setting the stage for complex discussions in Washington.</p>

The state-run People's Daily praised the commission's decisive handling of the matter, stating it was crucial for restoring public trust in the healthcare sector.

          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda reveals that young chimps acquire their unique combinations of vocal sounds and physical gestures from their mothers, not their fathers. Scientists observed that individuals related through their maternal line shared similar communication patterns, while no such resemblance was found with paternal relatives. This suggests the behaviors are learned through social exposure rather than genetics, as young chimps spend their formative years almost exclusively with their mothers. The findings imply that the capacity for socially learned communication may be an ancient trait shared with humans, dating back millions of years.</p>

          <p>A female black bear, known for her extensive 100-mile journey across Southern California, has been spotted with three cubs in the Santa Monica Mountains, establishing the first known bear family in the area in recent years. The bear, tracked by wildlife officials, traversed multiple freeways and urban areas before denning near Topanga Canyon and giving birth. Her unprecedented travels have provided valuable data on bear movement in the region. While her arrival with cubs marks a significant wildlife event, it has also raised questions and concerns among local residents unaccustomed to ursine neighbors.</p>

          <h2>California Implements Sweeping Conservation Plan for Western Joshua Tree</h2>

          <p>California has officially approved a comprehensive plan to protect the western Joshua tree, a species threatened by climate change and development. The plan identifies crucial conservation areas, aims to mitigate wildfire risks, and requires permits and fees for removing the iconic plants. While environmental groups praise the forward-looking effort to save a species before it becomes critically endangered, the regulations have sparked controversy. Local officials and property owners in desert communities argue the measures are overly restrictive, stalling housing projects and increasing costs in one of Southern California's last affordable regions.</p>

          <p>Teen Line, a Los Angeles-based crisis hotline staffed by trained teenage volunteers, is providing essential mental health support for young people as federal funding for such services is reduced. The hotline, a project of Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, offers a peer-to-peer connection for youth struggling with issues like loneliness, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. With the Trump administration cutting grants for school psychologists and altering the 988 crisis line, services like Teen Line have become even more critical. The volunteers offer a listening ear, helping to fill a widening gap in mental healthcare access for their generation.</p>

          <p>Investors from China have become the dominant force in Greece's "golden visa" program, which offers residency in exchange for real estate investment. Chinese citizens account for nearly half of all first-time permit holders and over 60% of renewals, having purchased thousands of apartments and properties, particularly in Athens. This influx of capital has quietly transformed parts of the Greek capital, driven by the appeal of gaining a foothold in the European Union. The data from Greece's Ministry of Migration and Asylum highlights the significant and growing economic influence of Chinese buyers in the country's property market.</p>

          <p>Germany's coalition government is set to create a National Security Council (NSR) to centralize and expedite decision-making on foreign policy and security matters. The new body, chaired by the chancellor, will consolidate information from various ministries to enable a more decisive and coordinated response to crises, a need highlighted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This move ends decades of debate and aims to overcome the slower, more deliberative processes that have sometimes hampered Germany's ability to act on the European stage. The NSR is expected to begin its work in October, replacing existing security committees.</p>
