        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked President Trump's reciprocal tariffs, which were unilaterally imposed on numerous countries to address trade imbalances. The court ruled that Trump exceeded his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) by levying universal import duties. The ruling, which the Trump administration immediately appealed, could significantly impact Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations. The court also struck down specific tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China related to drug trafficking, stating they didn't address the threats outlined in the orders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS secured a victory in its legal dispute with Sony Pictures Television, allowing the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" during the appeal process. A Los Angeles judge had previously ruled that Sony was no longer obligated to provide episodes to CBS, but an appellate panel paused the order. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, arguing that Sony's claims are based on dissatisfaction with the existing deal. CBS has distributed the shows for decades and earns a significant portion of the fees paid by TV stations.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the increase in naturalization applications among Latinos in the United States due to intensified immigration enforcement. The USCIS reported over 7.9 million people naturalized in the last decade, with numbers rising further in 2025 following the Trump administration's policies. Community organizations and law offices report increased interest in citizenship as a means of protection against deportation. Academics observe that this surge also presents an opportunity for greater electoral participation, particularly in the upcoming congressional elections. The article highlights the importance of Latino participation in defending democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for migrants who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs. The judge ordered the government to restart processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their status, extending protections to Ukrainians, Afghans, and military members' families. The decision is a victory for immigrant rights groups who sued to stop the administration's effort to strip legal status from various groups. The judge emphasized that it is not in the public interest to render hundreds of thousands of individuals unlawfully present in the country.</p>

These projects have been declared "nationally significant", which allows them to speed through the planning process. These reservoirs could be more than a decade away from opening, and household consumption of water may also need to fall to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population. The government intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" too.</p>
