          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle have surged, becoming the latest company to be labeled a "meme stock" after announcing a new campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The stock's high short interest, with over 13% of its shares sold short, attracted attention from individual investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This retail-driven rally is fueled by investors trying to cover their short positions, creating artificial buying pressure. The campaign, focusing on denim, comes as the company hopes to reverse a 35% stock decline seen so far in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly refuted claims that he intends to harm Elon Musk's companies by revoking their government subsidies. In a post on Truth Social, Trump stated, "This is not so!" and expressed his desire for all businesses in the country, including Musk's, to "THRIVE like never before." The statement follows a period of public friction between the two figures, which included disagreements over a major spending bill and Musk's criticism of the president's past association with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's post aims to quell speculation about potential retaliatory actions against Musk's enterprises.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that recent stock price drops for Honeywell and Dover present a good entry point for new investors. Despite both companies reporting solid quarterly earnings and Honeywell raising its guidance, their shares fell, which Cramer described as "disrespectful." He believes the market's negative reaction is unwarranted and that the stocks should be trading higher based on their performance metrics. The commentary also noted that Alphabet's increased capital expenditure forecast is a positive sign for semiconductor companies like Broadcom and Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The English Football Association's chief executive, Mark Bullingham, has firmly stated that England women's team manager Sarina Wiegman is "not for sale at any price."

Bullingham praised her "phenomenal" record and cool-headed leadership, emphasizing that both she and the FA are committed to her contract, which runs until 2027. Her success has made her a highly sought-after coach, but the FA is determined to retain her.</p>

          <h2>The Subjective Experience of Time and How to 'Live Longer'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the philosophical and scientific concept that our perception of time changes as we age, often seeming to speed up. It discusses theories from philosophers like Henri Bergson and research showing that a unit of time feels shorter relative to the total life one has experienced. To counteract this and make life feel subjectively longer, the article suggests focusing on creating dense, meaningful memories rather than just seeking simple fun. Strategies include pursuing emotionally significant activities, savoring moments fully, and avoiding routine to introduce novelty, all of which can enhance memory and the feeling of a richer, longer life.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is planning to introduce a new lineup of beverages, including cold brews, refreshers, and flavored sodas, in a test at over 500 U.S. locations this summer. The move is an effort to attract younger consumers and compete with popular beverage-focused chains like Dutch Bros. and Swig. This strategy follows the company's decision to shut down its stand-alone CosMc's drink-and-snack locations, instead integrating the successful beverage concepts from that brand into its main restaurants. The test aims to boost sales, which have been lackluster in recent quarters.</p>

          <p>Two wallabies that escaped from a private enclosure in Mouscron, Belgium, have led authorities on a multi-day, cross-border chase. One of the marsupials was successfully captured by firefighters in a residential garden near Lille, France, after several days on the loose. The second wallaby, however, remains at large, and police are relying on public sightings to locate it. The owner was on vacation when the animals escaped, and footage of the hopping fugitives navigating urban areas has been widely shared on social media, creating a unique international incident.</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new political party aimed at providing an alternative to what he calls Labour's "control freaks" and the "dangerously divisive" politics of Reform UK. Corbyn, now an independent MP, made the announcement alongside fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, stating it is "time for a new kind of political party" that will "take on the rich and powerful." While the party is not yet named, it is positioned to the left of Labour on issues like taxation and nationalization, and it aims to build a grassroots, community-led movement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Three British citizens arrested for smuggling nearly a kilogram of cocaine into Bali, Indonesia, have avoided the death penalty and received 12-month prison sentences. Lisa Stocker, Jon Collyer, and Phineas Float were arrested in February after the drugs were discovered disguised in packets of Angel Delight dessert mix. Under Indonesia's strict drug laws, they could have faced execution. With time already served, the three could be released by early 2026, a significantly lighter outcome than what is often handed down for such offenses in the country.</p>
