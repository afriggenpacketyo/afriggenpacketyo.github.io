          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that public schools must accommodate the religious beliefs of families, particularly concerning instruction on sensitive moral topics for young children. The ruling, in Mahmoud v.

The Court determined that schools cannot force children into instruction that contradicts their parents' religious views without a compelling reason, setting a significant precedent for parental rights in education.</p>

          <p>According to petroleum analysts, U.S. gas prices are expected to see a significant decline over the summer, potentially reaching their lowest levels since 2021. This trend is attributed to factors like increased refinery production and softening consumer demand after early summer travel peaks, which typically boost supply. While the recent Israel-Iran conflict caused a temporary spike, prices are anticipated to resume their downward trend, with the national average possibly falling below $3 per gallon by September.
