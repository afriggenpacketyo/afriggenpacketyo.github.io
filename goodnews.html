          <p>The D.C. Council has given final approval for the Washington Commanders to build a new $3.8 billion stadium at the former RFK Stadium site. This decision marks the team's planned return to the district by 2030 after nearly three decades of playing in Maryland. The project, championed by owner Josh Harris and Mayor Muriel Bowser, also includes plans for housing, retail space, and parkland, overcoming previous political hurdles related to the team's name. The vote solidifies a major urban redevelopment initiative for the city.</p>

          <p>An opinion article highlights the story of a Chinese student who chose culinary school over a traditional academic path, suggesting a positive shift in societal values. The piece argues that in a climate of intense academic competition, it is encouraging to see young people pursue their passions with family and societal support. It contrasts this with past narratives where such choices were seen as unusual, like the case of a Peking University graduate who became a butcher. The author calls for China to create more opportunities for its youth to follow their dreams beyond conventional routes.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called AI Fluency, which will require all undergraduate students to study artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, the program aims to ensure graduates are proficient in both their chosen field and the practical applications of AI. This curriculum change is a response to the rapidly growing demand for AI skills in the job market, where listings have increased over 600% in the last decade. The university hopes this requirement will provide its students with a significant competitive advantage in the future workforce.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate stocks, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's quarter-point cut was framed as a "risk management" move, with indications of two more potential cuts by year-end. While Japanese markets reacted positively, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results as investors digested the implications of the U.S. monetary policy shift. The Bank of Japan is also beginning its own policy meeting, where it is expected to hold its rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

The device can be controlled through hand gestures via a neural-interface wristband, allowing users to view videos and respond to messages without blocking their field of vision. This product serves as a bridge between Meta's audio-only smart glasses and its more advanced, experimental augmented reality projects.

          <p>During a ceremony marking its 75th anniversary, the Central Council of Jews in Germany publicly called on Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. Council President Josef Schuster urged the chancellor not to be swayed by criticism from other European nations or internal political voices. In his remarks, Chancellor Merz affirmed that criticism of the Israeli government is permissible but becomes antisemitism when it serves as a pretext for hatred. He emphasized Germany's commitment to protecting Jewish life and culture within the country.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming book, "107 Days," Kamala Harris reveals that her first choice for a running mate in the 2024 election was Pete Buttigieg. However, she ultimately decided against it, believing it was "too big of a risk" for a Black woman to run on a ticket with a gay man. Harris writes that while Buttigieg would have been an "ideal partner," she felt the combination of their identities would ask too much of the American electorate. The candid admission offers a rare insight into the strategic and demographic calculations that influence major political decisions at the highest level of a presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the storm is not projected to pose an immediate threat to land, with forecasts showing it tracking north of the Caribbean over open waters. However, meteorologists predict that Gabrielle could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves northwest. While its path remains uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda by next week, and forecasters are monitoring its development closely.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. By testing the figs and plums that make up the primates' diet, scientists determined the alcohol content was about 0.3% by weight. Due to the large quantity of fruit they eat daily, this amounts to an intake of approximately 14 grams of ethanol, equivalent to nearly two standard alcoholic drinks for a human. The study supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, suggesting human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in our primate ancestors' diets.</p>

Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers will be hesitant to risk further price increases by cutting rates again. The decision contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut and reflects the unique inflationary pressures facing the British economy. (not investment advice)</p>
