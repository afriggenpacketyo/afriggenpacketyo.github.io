          <p>Shao Chun Chen, a former Google employee, now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and "supercommutes" to Singapore for a three-hour-a-week lecturing job. Chen was laid off from his corporate job, which allowed him to realize he was financially independent due to investments. He earns between $1,540 to $3,070 monthly, enough to cover his family's living expenses in Thailand and his travel costs. Chen also generates income from YouTube content creation and coaching, working a total of four to eight hours weekly, and enjoys a better lifestyle in Thailand with significantly lower living costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK will permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new laws. This follows a previous ban enacted after a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by RedBird IMI, backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The new legislation allows State Owned Investors (SOIs) to take minority stakes, aiming to protect media plurality while helping publishers secure funding. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the changes will safeguard news media from foreign state control while recognizing the need for organizations to raise capital.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom has expressed support for two bills designed to streamline housing development in urban areas, citing the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other impediments to new housing. The governor specifically praised Assemblymember Buffy Wicks and state Sen. Scott Wiener for sponsoring bills aimed at easing the permitting process for infill projects.</p>
