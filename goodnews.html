        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, coupled with effective cost-cutting strategies that mitigated the impact of declining crude oil prices. CEO Darren Woods acknowledged the market's volatility, citing strong demand offset by higher supply and uncertainty stemming from President Trump's tariffs. The company reported a 6% decrease in profits to $7.71 billion, or $1.76 per share, while global production increased by 20% to 4.55 million barrels per day. Exxon Mobil returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating financial stability amid market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a slowdown in hiring, the US jobs market performed better than expected in April, adding 177,000 jobs amidst economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%. This article contrasts the positive jobs data with recent figures showing a contraction in US GDP, which has fueled fears of a recession. Economists attribute the GDP decline to a surge in imports as consumers and companies anticipated the implementation of tariffs, which suggests the jobs market may be more resilient than initially feared.</p>

For those plans, catch-up contributions will automatically stop once deferrals reach $7,500, the company told CNBC. While pretax 401(k) contributions offer an up-front tax break, you'll owe regular income taxes on withdrawals, depending on your future tax bracket. (not investment advice)</p>
