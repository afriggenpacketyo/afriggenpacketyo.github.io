          <h2>UK and US Trade Deal Includes Tariffs, Signaling a Shift in Global Trade</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States have reached a trade agreement that, while significant, includes tariffs, suggesting a new normal in international trade relations under President Trump's administration. The deal allows the UK to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% tariff rate, while steel and aluminum exports are tariff-free, a reduction from the previous 25% rate. However, all other goods from the UK will still be subject to a 10% baseline tariff, indicating that complete tariff-free deals may be rare. Experts suggest this deal sets a precedent for future trade agreements, with flexibility on sectoral tariffs but a minimum baseline tariff likely to remain.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government successfully negotiated a trade deal with the United States, marked by a televised phone call with President Trump announcing tariff rollbacks on some British exports like autos and steel. The negotiations involved navigating a complex relationship with the Trump administration, balancing conventional trade talks with the president's unpredictable impulses. Despite setbacks, Starmer's strategy of maintaining a positive relationship with Trump, including on issues like Ukraine, proved crucial in securing the agreement. The deal represents a significant achievement for Starmer, though some critics argue that the tariffs were not fully lifted.</p>

          <p>A federal court panel has ruled that Alabama's redistricting plan intentionally discriminated against Black voters, violating the Voting Rights Act. The judges found that the state legislature deliberately diluted Black voting strength by not creating a district that would allow Black voters to elect a candidate of their choice. This ruling follows a Supreme Court decision affirming that Alabama's 2021 congressional map was discriminatory. The court's decision may lead to further legal challenges and potential federal oversight of Alabama's future congressional districting.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data reveals that President Trump's tariffs are reshaping global trade flows. In April, Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent, while exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent. This shift indicates a redirection of trade, with Chinese factories accelerating shipments to other regions as the trade war intensifies. The data suggests that China is adapting to the tariffs by leveraging its manufacturing presence in Southeast Asia and exploring alternative markets.</p>
