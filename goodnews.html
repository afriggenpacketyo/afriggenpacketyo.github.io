          <p>South Korean memory chipmaker SK Hynix announced its readiness for mass production of next-generation HBM4 chips, vital for artificial intelligence computing and a key component for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture. This development positions the company ahead of rivals like Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, having completed internal validation and shipped samples to customers. The HBM4 technology offers double the bandwidth and a 40% increase in power efficiency, significantly boosting SK Hynix's shares and contributing to record operating profits from strong HBM demand. This strategic move is expected to solidify the company's market leadership in the rapidly expanding AI memory sector into the next year.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that Gen Z employees are pivotal in the adoption of artificial intelligence within workplaces, actively teaching older colleagues and reshaping office culture. Nearly two-thirds of younger staff are providing hands-on guidance and practical tips, fostering a significant knowledge exchange that helps bridge generational divides. The report highlights that 86% of employees find AI enhances efficiency, saving an average of 55 minutes daily, and significantly improves teamwork for hybrid setups. This collaborative approach enables senior directors to focus on higher-value tasks and is credited with unlocking new business opportunities, ultimately fostering stronger, more resilient teams across generations.</p>

The UK's economic stagnation adds a new dimension to the Bank of England's upcoming monetary policy review, contrasting with the European Central Bank's recent decision to keep interest rates unchanged.

          <p>Amazon's Project Kuiper has secured its first in-flight WiFi contract with JetBlue, marking a significant step in its intense competition with SpaceX's dominant Starlink satellite internet service. Although Amazon's current constellation of 102 satellites is considerably smaller than Starlink's thousands, this deal injects a fresh challenge into the rapidly expanding market. Project Kuiper aims to deploy 3,236 satellites by 2029, striving to match Starlink's extensive launch capacity and existing airline partnerships. The burgeoning global satellite internet sector, with an anticipated 70,000 Low Earth Orbit satellites by 2031, is driven by the potential for future 6G communications and the goal of connecting billions worldwide who currently lack internet access.</p>

          <p>UFC chief Dana White's first boxing event news conference, promoting the highly anticipated Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford super-fight, was largely overshadowed by a heated clash with a reporter. White became visibly agitated when questioned about the Muhammad Ali Act and the potential monopolistic implications of his new Saudi Arabian-backed boxing venture, which critics argue could restrict fighter earnings. The event, slated for global broadcast on Netflix, signals a new, albeit uncertain, era for the sport. Even Alvarez, one of boxing's biggest stars, intervened to defend the sport's magnitude, underscoring the ongoing tensions surrounding boxing's future structure and fighter rights.</p>

Taking over the brief after Angela Rayner's resignation, Reed advocated a "build baby build" strategy and threatened sanctions against developers who delay projects. Industry leaders, however, warn of a "huge challenge" to meet this target, citing mounting pressures from rising costs and planning application delays, which have contributed to a fall in new home numbers in the past year. Reed intends to introduce an "acceleration package" to expedite planning approvals and ensure rapid, large-scale construction.</p>

The Aces, spearheaded by A’ja Wilson's dominant performance of 23 points and 19 rebounds, established a new WNBA regular-season record by sinking 22 three-pointers. The short-handed Sparks struggled significantly against the Aces' potent offense, further hampered by Cameron Brink's exit due to injury.

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill proposes allowing terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to apply for an assisted death, necessitating approval from two doctors and a multi-disciplinary panel.

Introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, the legislation permits taller, denser buildings, up to nine stories, adjacent to certain transit stops, with the aim of alleviating the state's severe housing affordability crisis. Critics argue this represents an overreach, stripping local authorities of their ability to manage responsible growth and potentially altering single-family communities. However, the bill gained crucial momentum after amendments were added to include union hiring provisions, enhancing its prospects for final passage and the Governor's signature.</p>
