          <p>The Hershey Company has named Kirk Tanner, the current CEO of Wendy's, as its next chief executive, effective August 18. Tanner will succeed Michele Buck, who is retiring after nearly two decades with the confectionery giant. This move marks a return to the consumer packaged goods industry for Tanner, who spent over 30 years at PepsiCo before his brief tenure at Wendy's. In the interim, Wendy's has appointed its Chief Financial Officer, Ken Cook, as temporary CEO while the board searches for a permanent replacement.</p>

          <p>Georgia Representative Mike Collins is reportedly considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2026, aiming to challenge incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. In a video, Collins stated that while a Senate bid was not his original plan, he believes Ossoff "must go" and does not represent Georgia's values. The two-term congressman, a staunch Trump ally, indicated he would consult with his family and the former president before making a final decision. The Georgia Senate seat is seen by Republicans as a key opportunity to expand their majority in the upcoming midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a former union leader who ran a competitive independent campaign in 2024, has announced he will challenge Republican Senator Pete Ricketts in Nebraska's 2026 Senate race. Launching his campaign with a populist message, Osborn criticized Ricketts, a multimillionaire, for being part of a "playground for the rich" and not representing working families. Ricketts' campaign responded by labeling Osborn as a liberal beholden to out-of-state donors. Osborn, who gained national attention for leading a successful strike at Kellogg's, aims to build on the significant support he garnered in his previous Senate run.</p>

          <h2>New 'Superman' Film Praised for Sincere, Lighthearted Tone and Unique Approach</h2>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, is being lauded for its departure from the grim tone of recent adaptations, instead offering a bright, sincere, and whimsical take on the hero. The film introduces Superman into a world already populated with other superheroes, a choice that helps define his unique, earnest altruism. David Corenswet's portrayal emphasizes a more relatable, "regular-guy" sensibility for the character. This article praises the movie for embracing a fun, cartoonish energy and for building modern skepticism about sincerity directly into its optimistic and consciously silly narrative.</p>

          <p>The UK's Parliament has voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five tiers of men's football in England. The new body, independent of government and existing football authorities, is designed to protect clubs by ensuring their financial sustainability and putting fans' interests first. The legislation was introduced to address financial crises that have affected numerous clubs like Bury and Derby County. A proposal to mandate that more Premier League games be shown on free-to-air television was voted down during the bill's passage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $20,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing interest rates against accessibility. While both currently offer high returns, short-term CDs often provide slightly higher fixed rates, potentially earning more interest than a high-yield savings account over periods of three to twelve months. However, for longer terms, the higher variable rate of a savings account might yield more, assuming rates remain stable. The article emphasizes that CDs lock up funds, whereas savings accounts keep money liquid, making the best choice dependent on an individual's financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The goal marked Schüller's second of the tournament, cementing her role as Germany's primary striker following the retirement of Alexandra Popp. Now a veteran leader on the team, Schüller continues to be a crucial player for Germany's international ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is planning to allow most travelers to keep their shoes on during airport security screenings, ending a rule that has been in place for nearly two decades. According to people familiar with the matter, the agency briefed industry members on the upcoming change this week. The requirement for passengers to remove their shoes was implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. Travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program are already exempt from this rule, and the change would extend a similar convenience to the general public.</p>

          <h2>Five Key Considerations for Homeowners Interested in No-Closing-Cost HELOCs</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the trade-offs before borrowing. Lenders often recoup the waived closing fees by charging a higher interest rate or by imposing penalties if the credit line is closed within a few years. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying closing costs upfront would be cheaper in the long run. These products also tend to have stricter credit requirements. Homeowners are advised to read the fine print carefully and compare these HELOCs with traditional options to determine the most suitable financial strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus has been cleared of doping violations after successfully arguing that a banned substance entered her system through kissing. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) accepted her explanation that her then-partner was unknowingly using a product containing ostarine, which was transferred to her via bodily fluids over nine days. The court ruled that Thibus bore no fault or negligence for the positive test, which occurred in January 2024. This decision dismisses an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban for the fencer.</p>

          <p>Amazon's extended four-day Prime Day sales event is underway, serving as a key test of consumer resilience in the face of economic uncertainty driven by the Trump administration's trade tariffs. Analysts predict record spending, with shoppers potentially buying electronics and other goods now to avoid future price hikes. The tariffs, particularly on Chinese imports, put pressure on retailers to increase prices, though many have so far absorbed the costs or are selling off pre-tariff inventory. The event's success will offer insight into whether the strong job market can continue to fuel consumer spending through this period of shifting economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>
