          <p>General Motors revealed a suite of new software initiatives, including an in-vehicle conversational AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini, set to launch next year. The company also plans to introduce an advanced driver-assistance system by 2028 that will allow for hands-free and "eyes-off" driving under certain conditions, starting with the Cadillac Escalade IQ. These announcements are part of GM's strategy to transform its vehicles into intelligent assistants and usher in a "new era of mobility."

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 15:16:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, consumers with high credit card debt face a strategic decision. While lower Fed rates could eventually lead to reduced credit card APRs, the relief is unlikely to be immediate or substantial, as these cuts are typically incremental and don't directly correlate with credit card rates. The article suggests that waiting for these minor changes may be less effective than pursuing immediate debt relief options like forgiveness or consolidation programs, especially as interest continues to compound at high rates. Borrowers are advised to consider that proactive measures might offer more significant financial benefits than passively waiting for macroeconomic shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Hockey League has signed a first-of-its-kind, multi-year deal with prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket. The agreement gives the platforms access to official league data and logos, while the NHL gains brand exposure and what it describes as enhanced customer protections. Kalshi's CEO called the partnership a "seminal moment" for the industry, suggesting more deals with other sports leagues could follow. The move has drawn criticism from the American Gaming Association, which raised concerns about the platforms operating in states without legalized sports betting and to individuals under 21.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Face Dilemma on Locking Mortgage Rates Ahead of Expected Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prospective homebuyers are debating whether to lock in current mortgage rates, which are in the low 6% range, or wait for potential further drops following expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protects against unforeseen market spikes, but risks missing out on lower rates if the Fed acts as anticipated. Conversely, waiting could lead to savings, though there's no guarantee that Fed cuts will translate into significantly lower mortgage rates, and lenders may charge fees to "float down" to a new, lower rate later. The decision involves balancing the desire for a lower rate with the risk of market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Western Alliance, Kenneth Vecchione, addressed investor concerns by stating that an alleged loan fraud case that prompted a recent selloff is believed to be a "one-off issue." The regional bank had set aside $30 million for potential losses on a loan to the Cantor Group, whom it is now suing for fraud. Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has since reviewed its portfolio, re-verified collateral for all large loans, and found no other irregularities. The bank's third-quarter earnings report, which did not reveal further credit issues, helped calm market fears about systemic problems in its loan book.</p>

          <p>Amazon has introduced a new warehouse robotic system named "Blue Jay," which combines multiple tasks into a single, streamlined process. The system uses a series of robotic arms on a track to pick, sort, and consolidate items, a process that previously required three separate stations. Amazon states the goal is to assist employees with strenuous tasks and improve efficiency, noting the system can handle about 75% of items stored at its sites. The announcement comes amid scrutiny of Amazon's automation strategy and its impact on the workforce, with a recent report suggesting automation could replace the need for over 160,000 hires by 2027.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees considering a reverse mortgage to supplement their income, the process involves specific rules that differ from those for single borrowers. Both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home for life. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in access to less equity than if based on the older spouse's age. The article advises couples to carefully weigh the benefits, like eliminating mortgage payments, against long-term implications, such as what happens if one spouse passes away.

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet reveals that different antidepressant medications have significantly varied effects on patients' weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. Researchers analyzed data from over 58,000 participants and found that some drugs, like amitriptyline, were associated with weight gain, while others, like agomelatine, were linked to weight loss. Similarly, heart rates could increase or decrease depending on the specific medication. The study's authors emphasize that while antidepressants remain effective, these findings highlight the importance of tailoring treatment to individual patients' health profiles and preferences to mitigate potential side effects.</p>
