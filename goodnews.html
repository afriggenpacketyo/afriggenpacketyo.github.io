        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey have concluded that their case is significantly undermined by a central witness, according to sources familiar with the matter. The witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously, directly contradicting the core of the indictment. This development, detailed in an internal memo, suggests prosecutors face "insurmountable problems" in proving Comey knowingly made false statements to Congress, casting serious doubt on the viability of the politically charged prosecution.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Joe Root has downplayed the persistent criticism from Australian pundits regarding his failure to score a century in Test matches in Australia. Ahead of the upcoming Ashes series, Root stated that such commentary is irrelevant and that the only thing that will be remembered is the final scoreline of the series. Traveling without the burden of captaincy for the first time on an Australian tour, he expressed confidence in his game and emphasized that his focus is on contributing to a historic team victory rather than personal milestones.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. envoys, including Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, have joined mediators from Qatar and Turkey for the third day of indirect peace talks between Israel and Hamas in Egypt. The negotiations, centered on a plan proposed by President Trump, are showing signs of cautious optimism, with Hamas reportedly submitting a list of Palestinian prisoners for a potential exchange for hostages. While significant disagreements remain on key issues like a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli forces, the presence of high-level international figures is seen as a major push to end the war.</p>

          <p>Xiaomi's founder and CEO, Lei Jun, announced that initial sales for the company's new 17-series smartphones have surpassed expectations, signaling a strong performance against Apple's latest iPhone models. The company launched its flagship devices just two weeks after Apple's release, and another executive apologized for stock shortages due to high demand, noting that over one million units were sold in the first week. This early success reinforces Xiaomi's strategy of competing directly with premium brands like Apple and Huawei in the high-end smartphone market.</p>

          <h2>Chinese State Media Describes National Economy as an 'Unsinkable Aircraft Carrier'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a key political meeting, China's official party newspaper published a series of op-eds portraying the nation's economy as an "unsinkable economic aircraft carrier," resilient against both internal and external pressures. The articles emphasize the stability and predictability of China's long-term planning, contrasting it with what it calls wavering and self-isolating policies in some Western countries. This messaging aims to project confidence in China's economic model as it transitions towards growth driven by innovation, consumption, and green development, despite global uncertainties.

          <p>Three scientists—Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar Yaghi—have won the 2025 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their pioneering work in developing metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). These innovative materials feature a molecular structure with vast internal spaces, allowing them to store and separate gases and other chemicals with remarkable efficiency. Often compared to Hermione's handbag from Harry Potter for their ability to hold huge amounts in a tiny volume, MOFs have practical applications in capturing carbon dioxide, harvesting water from air, and storing toxic gases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money team details why preordering a book is a crucial form of support for authors, using their own upcoming book as an example. Preorder numbers are a key metric for booksellers, influencing decisions on stocking levels, in-store placement, and online visibility. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases the chance of a book landing on a bestseller list and creating a snowball effect of further sales. This inside look reveals the powerful economic forces at play in the publishing industry before a book even hits the shelves.</p>

          <p>Wharton professor and AI expert Ethan Mollick cautioned human resources leaders that "no one knows anything" definitive about the future impact of generative AI on the job market. Speaking at a CNBC summit, he stressed that even top AI research labs are uncertain about its best use cases and that expertise in the field is still nascent. Mollick urged leaders to move beyond theoretical task forces and instead encourage widespread, hands-on experimentation with AI tools, suggesting that the most valuable insights will come from empowering the entire workforce to discover practical applications.</p>

          <p>China has enacted a decree allowing it to impose retaliatory fees or restrictions on vessels from countries that limit its own ships, but the impact on U.S. operators is projected to be minimal. According to research firm Linerlytica, the U.S.-operated fleet in China is significantly smaller than the Chinese fleet exposed to potential U.S. fees, creating a major imbalance in leverage. While Chinese operators could face over $1 billion in U.S. fees, American companies would likely pay only a fraction of that if China were to impose similar measures. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill, initiated by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, would allow furloughed or unpaid federal employees to be reimbursed for childcare fees incurred during the shutdown. This legislative effort aims to alleviate one of the major financial strains on federal workers, who are being used as "bargaining chips" in the political stalemate, according to labor leaders who are demanding an end to the shutdown.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that will mandate landlords to include a working refrigerator and stove in all rental units. Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from "amenities" to necessities required for a unit to be considered habitable, similar to heating and running water. The law, which applies to new leases starting January 1, 2026, aims to ease the financial burden on renters, who will no longer have to purchase these costly appliances when moving into a new home.</p>
