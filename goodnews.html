          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) reported first-quarter revenue growth of 17% to $29.27 billion, falling short of analysts' expectations of $29.42 billion, marking the third consecutive quarter of revenue misses. Despite this, AWS operating income totaled $11.55 billion, with an operating margin of 39.5%, the widest since 2014. CEO Andy Jassy noted the company is launching a service for streaming video games and forming an agentic artificial intelligence group, with billions in annualized revenue from its AI business. AWS has also diversified away from China for components over the past six years, according to Jassy.</p>

          <p>Block's first-quarter results missed Wall Street expectations, leading to a 15% drop in stock during extended trading, with revenue decreasing about 3% year-over-year to $5.77 billion. The company provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing challenging economic conditions and President Trump's tariffs on imported goods. Despite the results, CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, with international markets and the expansion of Cash App's services as bright spots. The company also expects to deliver its first bitcoin mining chips with Proto in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board asserts that President Trump's first 100 days in office have damaged American democracy more than any event since Reconstruction, as he seeks to create a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts. The board emphasizes the need for a broad coalition of Americans, spanning diverse political views, to defend democratic debate and constitutional processes. While acknowledging Trump's legitimacy and the legality of some of his actions, the editorial urges opposition to his undemocratic actions through legal means and public pressure, citing the successful campaign against repealing Obamacare as a case study. The editorial underscores the importance of distinguishing between unwise and undemocratic actions to focus opposition effectively.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce is advocating for tariff exclusions for U.S. small businesses importing goods, cautioning that recently imposed tariffs could severely harm America's Main Street. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber's CEO requested an "automatic exclusion" for small businesses, emphasizing their limited financial reserves to withstand tariff increases. The Chamber warns that tariffs are already impacting growth and raising recession risks, potentially causing "irreparable harm" to small businesses if trade deals aren't reached promptly. Senator Ed Markey has also called on the Trump administration to grant tariff exemptions to Main Street enterprises.</p>

Despite challenges in China, where sales declined, Apple saw increased iPhone sales in Japan, India, and the Middle East, and its services business continued to shine.

Kennedy has praised the use of drugs like budesonide and clarithromycin for treating measles, despite limited evidence supporting their effectiveness. The CDC has published a fact sheet for doctors treating measles, emphasizing that other treatments should be prescribed based on clinical judgement. The request comes after the agency stepped up its warning against overuse of vitamin A, which does not cure measles infections but can be useful for reducing the risk of severe illness.</p>

Waltz faced scrutiny for mistakenly adding a journalist to a Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources indicate Trump respected Waltz, leading to a soft landing with a high-profile new post, although confirmation by the Senate may be challenging.</p>
