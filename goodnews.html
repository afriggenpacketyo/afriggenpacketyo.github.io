          <p>Zhang, a pioneer in China's internet industry and founder of Sohu.com, is advising college graduates to prioritize starting businesses over pursuing graduate degrees. Drawing from his own experience, Zhang believes that practical know-how gained from working at a company is more valuable than postgraduate education when establishing a business. He suggested that graduates should consider starting their own ventures to acquire practical skills. Zhang obtained a PhD in physics from MIT and later founded Internet Technologies China, which became Sohu.com, the first mainland internet company to raise venture capital funding.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee has revealed its version of President Trump's tax bill, differing from the House-passed version, potentially leading to disagreements between the two chambers. Key differences include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and the child tax credit amount. The Senate bill proposes keeping the SALT deduction cap at $10,000, while the House bill offers up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate version permanently extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts and includes a $5 trillion hike to the federal debt limit. (not investment advice)</p>

He pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets and accumulating over $40 million in debt.

          <p>The capsizing of North Korea's new warship during its launch garnered international attention, revealing insights into Kim Jong Un's regime. Kim denounced the failure as a "criminal act" and ordered immediate restoration and punishment for those responsible, demonstrating the regime's seriousness about building a nuclear-armed navy. Experts suggest that publicizing the capsizing was a deliberate political strategy to show the regime addressing problems and holding people accountable. The swift repair of the warship, completed in just over three weeks, highlights how even failures can be turned into political successes.</p>

The orders often target firms for taking on certain pro bono clients, associating with Trump's legal foes, or engaging in diversity, equity, and inclusion practices.
