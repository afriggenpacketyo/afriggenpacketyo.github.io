          <p>Several newspapers are leading with the release of Peter Sullivan, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1986 and spent 38 years in jail. New DNA evidence led to his conviction being quashed, and he says he harbors no anger or bitterness. Several articles also highlight research into new weight-loss drugs, specifically GLP-1 agonists, which have shown to halve deaths from strokes and heart attacks in trials. These medications could potentially alleviate pressure on the NHS and reduce the risk of various heart, liver, and kidney diseases, heralding a "golden age" of medicine. Counter-terrorism police are also investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, considering the possibility of a hostile state being involved.</p>

          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as ultra-rich individuals seek personalized wealth management services. However, these offices are struggling to find qualified money managers due to a combination of factors, including competition from banks and other financial firms, a talent crunch, and the high selectivity of family offices. Trust is a key criterion, often prioritized over other qualifications, which can sometimes hinder the hiring process. Some family offices are also looking to combine multiple roles into one, making it harder to find suitable candidates. This article discusses the challenges faced by wealthy families in securing trustworthy and capable individuals to manage their assets, and suggests that they may need to offer higher compensation packages to attract the right talent.

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced he will lift sanctions on Syria ahead of a planned meeting with Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. The White House confirmed Trump will "say hello" to Syria's interim president during his Middle East tour in Saudi Arabia. The lifting of sanctions, which previously blocked foreign financing and aid, was met with celebration in Damascus. Trump stated the policy change would give Syria "a chance at greatness." The Syrian Foreign Minister celebrated the decision as a pivotal moment for the country, anticipating stability and reconstruction.</p>

          <p>China has reasserted its territorial claims near its contested border with India by releasing "standard" names for dozens of places in the Arunachal Pradesh region, which China refers to as Zangnan. This action comes despite recent efforts to improve diplomatic relations between the two countries, following a period of tension and military clashes. The Ministry of Civil Affairs published names for 27 geographical features, including mountains, residential areas, and rivers, in Chinese characters, Tibetan, and pinyin. The move is seen as a way for China to reinforce its stance on the disputed territory, even as diplomatic efforts continue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Iran has proposed a new plan to American negotiators for a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. President Trump has expressed a desire to make a deal with Iran to improve regional safety, but has warned that Iran needs to make a decision soon to avoid further economic pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Even as the United States and China ease trade tensions, Beijing is preparing for continued rivalry with Washington, as highlighted in this article. China's pursuit of economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia is unlikely to soften its stance on regional territorial claims and military competition. While a tariff truce may open the way for talks between Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping, Beijing views the pause as a tactical retreat by the U.S. rather than a fundamental shift away from hostility toward the Chinese Communist Party. China is leveraging Washington‚Äôs trade policy upheaval to present itself as a stable alternative while simultaneously pressing its claims in sovereignty disputes with maritime neighbors.</p>

          <p>Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg suggested that Joe Biden's decision to run for a second term in 2024 might have been a mistake. When asked if the Democratic party would have been better off without Biden as the nominee, Buttigieg responded, "Maybe, you know, right now, with the benefit of hindsight, I think most people would agree that is the case." He affirmed Biden's cognitive abilities during his time in office, citing his close work with Biden during the Baltimore bridge collapse. Buttigieg's comments come amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>As President Trump cuts funding for American research institutions and restricts immigration, other countries are seizing the opportunity to attract disillusioned scientists and academics. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute calls this a "once-in-a-century brain gain opportunity." The European Union has announced additional funding to attract researchers, and individual countries like France, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden are offering financial incentives and academic positions. While salaries may be lower in Europe, the generous social safety net can compensate for the difference. A poll indicates that a significant number of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students in the United States are considering leaving due to the Trump administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Popular Twitch streamer and political commentator Hasan Piker claims he was detained and questioned by federal authorities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for more than two hours. Piker, who has openly criticized the Trump administration and spoken out against the war in Gaza, believes he was targeted for his political views. He alleges that he was asked about his opinions on Donald Trump, Israel, Hamas, and the Houthis rebels in Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the detention but denied that Piker's political beliefs were the reason.</p>
