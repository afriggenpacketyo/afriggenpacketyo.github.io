          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced that quantum computing is reaching an "inflection point," suggesting that these machines will soon be capable of solving real-world problems. Quantum computers use quantum mechanics to tackle complex problems that classical computers cannot handle. The technology employs qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously, enabling the processing of vast amounts of data. This announcement has sparked investor interest in quantum computing stocks, such as Rigetti Computing and IonQ, indicating growing confidence in the field's potential.

          <p>Senate Republicans are advancing President Trump's agenda to overhaul the student loan system, targeting Biden's expansion of Borrower Defense to Repayment and Closed School Discharge regulations. The bill seeks to end what Republicans call costly policies that shift federal student loan burdens onto taxpayers. It also proposes eliminating federal Grad PLUS loans and establishing a Workforce Pell Grant to encourage non-collegiate degrees. The legislation aims to crack down on taxpayer funding for degrees from lower-performing universities, blocking federal student loan programs for colleges where graduates earn less than those without degrees.

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy is urging Democrats to embrace populism and address the economic and spiritual crises facing the country. He suggests the party should focus on making work pay, giving power to people, and becoming a bigger tent on social and cultural issues. Murphy criticizes the party's recent policies as feeling like handouts rather than empowerment, emphasizing the need for a higher minimum wage, stronger labor unions, and fairer work rules. He also highlights the importance of Democrats engaging in risk-taking to save democracy and addressing the identity crisis among young men. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Inflation Steady Amid Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 08:57:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation showed little change last month as President Trump's tariffs have so far not had a big effect on the prices that American shoppers pay. Consumer prices in May were up 2.4% from a year ago, according to a report Wednesday from the Labor Department. That's a slightly larger annual increase than the month before, however, prices rose just 0.1% between April and May ‚Äî down from 0.2% the month before. Falling gasoline prices helped to offset the rising cost of rent and groceries. The president has imposed an import tax of at least 10% on nearly everything the U.S. buys from other countries, and that tax rate could increase next month, at the conclusion of a 90-day window for trade negotiations.</p>
