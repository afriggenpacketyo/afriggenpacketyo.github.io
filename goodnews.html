          <p>General Asim Munir, Pakistan's army chief, has arrived in Washington for a visit expected to last until June 18, which includes attending the US Army‚Äôs 250th anniversary celebrations. The visit, reportedly at the invitation of the Trump administration, will likely involve high-level meetings at the State Department and the Pentagon. Analysts suggest that Munir's acceptance of the invitation indicates Pakistan‚Äôs desire to recalibrate its relationship with the US amid increasing US-India strategic alignment and growing American concerns over China‚Äôs global influence. Discussions are expected to cover topics such as cryptocurrency, China's influence, and critical minerals, reflecting the complex geopolitical landscape and economic interests at play.</p>
