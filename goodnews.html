        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups, which presented substantial evidence of unconstitutional tactics, such as targeting individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The order also mandates that federal authorities provide detained individuals with proper access to legal counsel at a Los Angeles facility. This decision comes amid heightened tensions and fear within Latino communities due to an increase in federal immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has imposed an emergency ban on carrying substandard portable power banks onto commercial flights, following several incidents where defective units caught fire. The new rule, effective since June 28, prohibits any portable batteries that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark. This has led to confusion among travelers and large piles of abandoned power banks at airports. The measure is part of a broader safety crackdown in Asia, as aviation authorities seek to mitigate the risks associated with lithium-ion batteries during air travel.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the competitive AI talent landscape, hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key personnel. While not an acquisition of the company, Google is paying $2.4 billion for licensing fees and compensation to bring the team to its Google DeepMind division. Windsurf, which specializes in AI tools for writing code, remains an independent entity. This deal underscores the intense "talent war" among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, all vying to absorb top AI researchers and engineers.</p>

          <p>With the patent for the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide (sold as Ozempic) expiring in China next year, a significant market shift is anticipated. Currently, around 60 similar drugs are undergoing trials by Chinese pharmaceutical firms, positioning them to launch cheaper generic versions and capture a share of the estimated US$150 billion global market. This impending competition is expected to drive down prices and increase accessibility for patients with obesity and diabetes. The development reflects a major push by China's biotech industry to compete with established Western pharmaceutical giants in producing lucrative GLP-1 agonist drugs.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord "El Chapo," has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to running a major part of the Sinaloa Cartel. As part of the plea, he admitted to coordinating large-scale shipments of fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine into the United States and using violence to protect the cartel's operations. U.S. authorities hailed the plea as a significant victory in the effort to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and combat the fentanyl epidemic. Guzman Lopez, one of the four "Chapitos" brothers, also agreed to forfeit $80 million as part of the deal.</p>

          <p>A terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has commenced a $365 million expansion project, signaling confidence despite a recent slowdown in port activity due to rising tariffs and global trade tensions. The project will increase cargo-handling capacity by 50% and enable the port to accommodate larger container ships, which officials say is crucial for long-term demand. Port executives acknowledge the current period of uncertainty but stress the importance of investing in infrastructure to strengthen the American supply chain. The move is seen as a strategic effort to maintain competitiveness and prepare for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decade after its quiet release, the song "The Night We Met" by indie folk band Lord Huron has become a massive global success, out-streaming many contemporary pop hits.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will be a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, both competing for their first title at the tournament. Swiatek, the world number one, has had to adapt her powerful game to the grass courts, while Anisimova is fulfilling her early potential after taking a break for her mental health. Analysts suggest the match will be decided by who better handles the pressure of the occasion. Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style as the underdog could pose a unique challenge to the more experienced Swiatek.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is championing a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, navigating the complex relationship between the U.S. and China. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests rather than being defined by traditional alliances. While affirming the importance of the AUKUS security pact and the U.S. alliance, this "Australia first" approach suggests a recalibration aimed at shaping the nation's own future. This strategic shift comes as his government holds a strong political mandate to make bold policy decisions.</p>
