          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, offers a well-made and accessible version of the Troma classic. Starring Peter Dinklage as the mutated hero, this iteration presents a more emotionally grounded story while retaining the original's gory and goofy spirit. The film pits the janitor-turned-vigilante against a villainous pharmaceutical corporation run by a CEO played by Kevin Bacon. While the polished production and star-studded cast may differ from the low-budget charm of the original, the movie serves as a diverting and environmentally conscious tribute that pokes fun at modern superhero tropes.</p>

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team has secured a place in the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2002 with a decisive victory over Fiji. Winger Francesca McGhie was a standout player, scoring two tries to bring her tournament total to five. Despite a spirited effort from Fiji, who scored three tries of their own, Scotland maintained control with additional scores from Rhona Lloyd and a remarkable solo try by Emma Orr. The victory sets up a crucial pool-deciding match for Scotland against Canada next weekend as they continue their historic tournament run.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo performed together at the Hollywood Bowl in a concert titled "Sarabande Africaine," exploring the African roots of Baroque music. The performance highlighted the historical connection between African rhythms and the sarabande, a dance form used by composers like Bach and Handel. The show blended classical pieces with African drumming, Caribbean piano, and renditions of works by Philip Glass, Gershwin, and Ravel, reinterpreted through an African lens. The collaboration, which began after the artists met in 2017, created a unique musical dialogue that celebrated shared cultural histories and global connections.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were exposed by receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought affecting the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water to a point where excavation of the Hellenistic-period tombs is possible. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has inadvertently created opportunities for archaeological discovery. The team is working to excavate and preserve the artifacts at the Duhok Museum before the area is once again submerged by water.</p>
