          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for an "aggressive form" of prostate cancer, which was diagnosed in May 2025. A spokesperson confirmed he is responding well to treatment, which began "a few weeks ago" in Philadelphia. Biden's prostate cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5) with metastasis to the bone, placing him in the most aggressive risk category. This article notes that prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer affecting men, with age being a primary risk factor. He also underwent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma, a common form of skin cancer, two years prior while still in office.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's poor performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, has raised significant concerns for the team ahead of the NL Championship Series. Manager Dave Roberts attributed some of Ohtani's struggles to facing numerous left-handed pitchers, noting the difficulty for all left-handed hitters in the series. However, Roberts emphasized the need for Ohtani to improve his "at-bat quality," stating the Dodgers cannot win the World Series with such a performance. The article highlights Ohtani's importance to the lineup and the pressure on him to recalibrate his approach, particularly against left-handed pitching, and better manage the strike zone.</p>

          <p>Golf icon Tiger Woods has undergone his seventh back surgery, this time to address a collapsed disc in his spine, casting doubt on his future comeback. The 15-time major winner experienced pain and lack of mobility in his lower back, leading to a lumbar disk replacement surgery that was deemed successful by Dr. Sheeraz Qureshi and his team. This marks his second back surgery in just over a year, adding to a growing list of injuries, including a ruptured left Achilles earlier this year. The article notes that Woods has not featured in a major tournament since the 2024 Open Championship, and his return to competitive golf remains uncertain, despite his appearances in the new TGL indoor competition.</p>

Allen, who had previously retired from boxing five years ago, made a comeback with title aspirations and showed toughness throughout the bout, landing significant blows in later rounds. He expressed deep emotion for the atmosphere and vowed he is "not finished" with the sport, despite this setback, aiming to rebuild his career once more.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on Sunday, October 26, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," grants most people an extra hour of sleep but means an additional hour for night shift workers. The practice, initiated by Germany in 1916 during World War One to maximize evening daylight and reduce fuel consumption, has continued for over a century. Debates persist about whether the UK should permanently adopt summer time, weighing potential boosts in economic productivity and reduced road accidents against very gloomy winter mornings, especially in Scotland.</p>

          <p>A BBC presenter, Lucy Owen, recounts her initial shock and subsequent journey to understand her 86-year-old mother Patsy's determined decision to donate her body to medical science after death. Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, wishes to express gratitude to medical professionals and aid future doctors' education, envisioning her body as a "silent teacher." Owen's documentary explored Cardiff University's anatomy center, where students learn from real bodies, developing connections with donors and appreciating the anatomical variations. The article highlights the importance of such donations for medical training, the emotional impact on families during the waiting period, and the declining inquiry rates for body donation in the UK, despite its crucial role.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, with common colds, flu, and Covid-19 circulating, leading many to feel unwell with particularly nasty symptoms. Experts attribute this to seasonal factors like children returning to school, adults back at work, and people spending more time indoors, creating ideal conditions for respiratory viruses to flourish. While Rhinovirus (common cold) is currently the most prevalent, Covid-19 variants are also active, and early signs suggest a rise in flu cases, particularly among younger age groups. Health officials advise vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene measures like handwashing and staying home when sick to protect vulnerable populations, noting current illness levels are not unusually high.</p>

          <p>A report from ABTA reveals an increasing number of people are using AI, like ChatGPT, to plan their holidays, from suggesting destinations to crafting itineraries. While some users, like Alan Smith, found AI helpful in discovering charming places like Castro Urdiales, Spain, others experienced inaccuracies, such as Hannah Read being given incorrect ferry route information for Norway. The article highlights that AI can save significant time by consolidating travel information, but stresses the importance of fact-checking recommendations, especially for critical details like transport, opening times, and travel durations. Experts advise users to understand AI's programming, which can be overly affirming, and to use it as a starting point rather than a definitive guide to avoid disappointment or logistical issues during trips.</p>

          <h2>China's Next Five-Year Plan to Reshape Infrastructure Investment with Tech Focus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 18:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, the document is expected to redefine the country's infrastructure spending and investment, shifting towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. This comes after decades of rapid expansion, including a massive 4-trillion-yuan (US$586 billion circa 2009) stimulus package in 2009 that helped China navigate the global financial crisis but also led to local government debt, a persistent source of financial pressure. While infrastructure investment remains crucial for economic growth, the new plan aims to address past issues and align with the demands of a new era. Economists anticipate continued large-scale infrastructure spending with an evolving strategic focus, indicating a significant policy recalibration. (not investment advice)</p>
