          <h2>Shanghai Plans Major Expansion to Solidify China's Global Shipbuilding Dominance</h2>

          <p>The Shanghai municipal government has announced significant expansion plans for its shipyards on Changxing Island, located near the Yangshan Deep-Water Port, to bolster China's standing as a top global shipbuilder. This strategic development aims to transform the cluster into a world-class hub for high-end marine equipment manufacturing, with a focus on producing advanced vessels such as LNG carriers and dual-fuel container ships, which are projected to account for 80% of the industrial output. The government estimates this expansion will reach an industrial scale of over 120 billion yuan (US$16.71 billion) within three years. The initiative also seeks to attract at least three leading international institutions, positioning the area as a powerhouse for technological breakthroughs in the maritime sector.</p>

          <p>Cooper Flagg, the No. 1 overall pick for the Dallas Mavericks in this year’s NBA draft, successfully navigated his Las Vegas Summer League debut, demonstrating a strong winning mentality despite an initial self-critique. Though he struggled with shooting in his first game, Flagg showcased his playmaking and defensive prowess, rebounding impressively with 31 points in his subsequent and final Summer League appearance. Long compared to NBA stars like Kevin Garnett and Jayson Tatum for his two-way skillset and relentless work ethic, Flagg has consistently sought out greater challenges, even reclassifying twice to accelerate his entry into college and then the NBA. His focused and reserved demeanor, coupled with an unwavering commitment to improvement, positions him as one of the most highly anticipated teenage prospects in decades.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Uncover 1,700-Year-Old Royal Maya Tomb in Belize</h2>

          <p>A Texas archaeologist couple, Arlen and Diane Chase from the University of Houston, has made a significant discovery, unearthing the 4th-century tomb of Te' K’ab Chaak, the earliest ruler of the ancient Maya city of Caracol in Belize. This monumental find represents the first confirmed royal tomb at the site, a major political player in Maya history from 560 through 680 AD. The tomb was richly adorned with "priceless" treasures, including 11 pottery vessels, carved bone tubes, a mosaic death mask, and jewelry crafted from jadeite, all coated in cinnabar. These artifacts, dating to 350 A.D., provide invaluable insights into the ancient culture, long-distance trade, and the societal structure of the early Caracol dynasty.</p>

          <p>CBS has made the unexpected announcement that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end in May 2026, attributing the decision to financial considerations within the challenging late-night television environment. Host Stephen Colbert shared the news with his live audience, marking the end of the network's late-night comedy programming after more than three decades. This development closely follows CBS parent company Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who alleged deceptive editing of an interview with Kamala Harris. Despite CBS's assertion that the cancellation is unrelated to the show's content or performance, the timing has raised skepticism among some, including Senator Adam Schiff, who suggested potential political motivations tied to the Trump settlement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has announced its inaugural use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for visual effects in one of its original TV productions, "The Eternauts," specifically for a scene depicting a building collapse. Co-chief executive Ted Sarandos highlighted that this AI integration enabled the production team to complete complex sequences ten times faster and at a substantially lower cost, thereby making advanced visual effects accessible for shows with more modest budgets. While the use of generative AI in the entertainment industry is contentious, sparking debates over intellectual property rights and the potential replacement of human labor, Netflix views this technology as a significant advancement for production efficiency and expanding creative opportunities within its content pipeline.</p>

          <p>The space sector is experiencing a significant investment boom, with startups attracting $3.1 billion in funding during the second quarter, making it the second-largest investment period on record. This surge, up from $2.1 billion in the first quarter, is largely attributed to sustained interest in defense-related opportunities and an overall improvement in market sentiment. U.S. firms dominated this funding, securing 70% of the capital, and their year-to-date investment has already exceeded the total for all of 2024, despite federal contracts and NASA budget cuts. Venture capital companies are leading the charge, contributing 77% of the sector's funding in 2025, with strong momentum noted in areas such as crewed space stations and on-orbit servicing. The industry anticipates over $35 billion in high-value deals by 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed groundbreaking infrared sensing technology, capable of detecting objects at speeds 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, inspired by the remarkable heat-sensing abilities of the fire beetle. This insect is equipped with a specialized pit organ that enables it to detect subtle infrared radiation from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away, even during rapid flight, surpassing the sensitivity of most commercial infrared detectors. This biomimetic technology offers enhanced clear imaging and accurate detection by effectively penetrating environmental obscurants like smoke, fog, or dust, making it highly valuable for various military and industrial applications. This innovation underscores the potential of biological systems to inspire new designs for advanced optoelectronic devices, significantly bolstering Chinese defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite facing multi-front wars, a substantial protest movement, and international war crimes allegations, Israel's stock market has achieved record highs, demonstrating the most significant gains among Middle Eastern countries over the past 22 months. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has rebounded over 200% from its October 2023 low, primarily fueled by substantial foreign investment and a resurgence of investor confidence following its recent conflict with Iran. The country's robust tech sector, which accounts for 20% of its GDP and 56% of international exports, is a pivotal economic driver. This remarkable market performance is attributed to Israel's underlying economic dynamism and a perception among global investors that security risks in the region are diminishing.

          <p>A Chinese farmer named Zhang, residing in Anhui province, has achieved a lifelong aspiration by successfully constructing a functional 7-meter homemade submarine. Driven by a childhood fascination with invention, Zhang was particularly inspired by a state broadcaster CCTV program showcasing a submarine. In 2014, he meticulously gathered 5,000 yuan (US$700) to acquire necessary materials such as steel plates, a battery, and an engine. He discreetly built the vessel while his wife was away, demonstrating remarkable ingenuity and perseverance. The submarine, which glides through the water with a "low mechanical growl," has captivated villagers on a quiet river, serving as a testament to individual innovation emerging from rural China.</p>

          <p>Stephen Schroeder shares his challenging 1.5-year ordeal to receive a diagnosis of Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a rare and invasive cancer, after initial medical assessments dismissed his persistent itch as a common fungal infection. Despite undergoing numerous treatments and consulting various specialists, his symptoms only worsened, prompting him to finally suggest a biopsy. The subsequent diagnosis revealed that the EMPD had already advanced, necessitating multiple complex surgeries and extensive skin grafts. Schroeder emphasizes the difficulties he faced in navigating a fragmented healthcare system and the profound isolation experienced when dealing with such a rare condition. Now five years cancer-free, he dedicates his efforts to advocating for earlier diagnosis and raising awareness, having established a vital online resource and support group for EMPD patients globally.</p>
