          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin, who escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit. Arkansas law enforcement officers and the U.S. Border Patrol located Hardin near Moccasin Creek, and he was taken into custody.

          <p>Japan and the United States continue to negotiate tariff issues, aiming to reach a trade agreement by mid-June, although common ground has not yet been found. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, stated that "further progress" was made after talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Japan seeks the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, including a 24 percent tariff (10 percent baseline plus 14 percent country-specific) and a 25 percent tariff on automobiles. Japan has proposed joint efforts in strengthening supply chains, cooperation in shipbuilding, increased imports of U.S. farm products, and simplified safety requirements for foreign-made cars.</p>
