          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, highlighted Beijing's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with countries in the region, resulting in agreements worth nearly US$25 billion. China National Nuclear Corporation will lead a project to build another nuclear power plant in Kazakhstan, further cementing Beijing's influence. The European Union is also seeking to expand its ties with Central Asia, eyeing the region's raw materials, while Russia maintains strong security ties with Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan through the Collective Security Treaty Organisation. These developments suggest a complex interplay of global actors vying for influence in the strategically important region.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, maintains her innocence, and her conviction was overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of blood evidence from the couple's bedroom revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. Despite the overturned conviction, the District Attorney's Office decided to retry her, only to drop the charges just as jury selection was about to begin due to insufficient evidence. Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik reported her husband Bob missing the evening of Sunday, Feb. 13, 2000. She told the San Diego County Sheriff's Department she had last seen him that afternoon, when he said he was going out for a jog. Bob Dorotik's body was found early the next morning on the side of the road several miles from their Valley Center, California, home. He had been bludgeoned in the head and strangled. In April 2020, Jane Dorotik was temporarily released from prison due to COVID health concerns, with a new trial beginning in May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecutors dropped the charges.</p>

The scheme grants Hong Kong residents a new daily remittance quota for the yuan, which is expected to boost the city‚Äôs status as a financial center.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese studies suggest that transplanting cells into the spleen could be a promising method for treating diabetes. Researchers at Nanjing University found that "shielding" islet cells improves their survival after transplantation into the spleen, and that the spleen can be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. Type 1 diabetes is a genetic autoimmune disorder where the body attacks islet cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. While medication can manage symptoms, there is currently no cure, but this research could transform the spleen into a hub for treating diabetes.</p>

The state stood by its original investigation, maintaining the bedroom was the murder scene, stating that the evidence still points to Jane Dorotik as the killer, and that the defense "arguments are largely derived from speculation and misstatements of fact." In May 2022, just as jury selection was about to begin, the prosecution surprised everyone yet again and dropped the charges.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have created a two-kilowatt fiber laser that can operate without heating or cooling systems in extreme climates, ranging from minus 50 degrees Celsius in the Arctic to 50 degrees Celsius in the Sahara Desert. The laser is designed for quick and ultra-portable deployment for defense and industrial applications. The innovation stabilizes laser performance across wide temperature swings through design choices, including 940-nanometer pump lasers with minimal thermal drift and a dual-clad optical resonator. This breakthrough overcomes challenges in maintaining laser stability across diverse environments.</p>
