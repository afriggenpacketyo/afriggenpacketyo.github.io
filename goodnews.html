          <h2>Hollywood Increasingly Relies on UK Studios Due to Favorable Tax Incentives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 22:18:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood studios are increasingly shifting film productions to the United Kingdom due to generous tax incentives, lower labor costs, and centralized funding for film, with 65% of UK production spending coming from major US studios and streaming giants. This shift has led to a decline in film and television production in Los Angeles. Blockbusters like "Barbie," "Jurassic World: Dominion," and "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" have all utilized UK studios, with "Jurassic World: Dominion" saving ¬£89.1m due to these incentives. The article also explores how various UK cities and regions have been used as filming locations for US movies, standing in for places like New York and Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino, a 15-year-old high school student, is garnering attention for his ability to land quadruple jumps, drawing comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata. Nishino recently landed a quad toe loop in competition and has previously executed a quad salchow. His coach notes his rapid physical growth, requiring quick adjustments to bigger boots and blades, but his performance continues to improve. Nishino aims to achieve strong results at the World Junior Championships and Junior Grand Prix Final in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed in the ongoing legal dispute between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni over allegations surrounding the making of their 2024 film "It Ends with Us." Swift's spokesperson stated that the subpoena is designed to use Swift's name to draw public interest, as she had minimal involvement with the film, only permitting the use of one song, 'My Tears Ricochet.' The legal battle between Lively and Baldoni involves allegations of sexual harassment and defamation, with both parties filing lawsuits against each other.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere this weekend. Experts predict the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact time and location remain uncertain. The spacecraft, designed to withstand the Venusian atmosphere, may partially survive its descent through Earth's atmosphere, but the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>A dump truck crashed into the back of the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood, California, after colliding with five vehicles, resulting in a power outage for nearby businesses. The incident occurred in the afternoon, and authorities reported no injuries. The crash brought down a main wire, initially affecting 1,420 customers, but crews rerouted power to reduce the number of affected customers to 225. Southern California Edison crews are working to fully restore power to the area.</p>

          <p>Elton John and Dua Lipa are among over 400 British musicians, writers, and artists seeking protection from AI by urging the Prime Minister to back an amendment to the Data (Use and Access) Bill. They want developers to be transparent with copyright owners about using their material to train AI models, arguing that failing to do so would mean them "giving away" their work to tech firms. The proposed amendment, by Baroness Beeban Kidron, aims to allow licensing agreements between creators and companies. The government says it is consulting on measures that will work for both creative industries and AI companies.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual quarantine on sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that make them potentially poisonous to humans. The quarantine, which runs through October 31, warns against eating mussels harvested off the West Coast due to the risk of paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. These toxins are produced by algae blooms, which are more common this time of year, and accumulate in shellfish tissue. Commercially grown mussels are exempt from the quarantine as they are regularly tested.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was freed from ICE custody after a federal judge in Vermont ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration due to a column she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The judge slammed the government for not providing evidence against her aside from the op-ed and highlighted her commitment to her academic career. Ozturk will return to Vermont and resume her doctoral studies.</p>

          <p>Tap water is now safe to drink in areas served by all nine water systems where damage from the firestorms in Altadena and Pacific Palisades had prompted ‚Äúdo not drink‚Äù notices, according to state regulators. The last water utility with such a notice, the Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, was cleared to resume delivering drinking water. State officials worked with utilities to assess damage, test for potential contamination, and ensure safe water service. The restoration reflects the considerable effort each utility has undertaken, but rebuilding systems remains a challenge.</p>
