          <h2>Study Suggests Vitamin D May Slow Down Biological Aging</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 19:54:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia indicates that daily vitamin D supplements could potentially slow biological aging. The research, which tracked over 1,000 U.S. adults over four years, found that vitamin D3 may protect against the shortening of telomeres, which are protective caps on DNA that erode with age. Participants taking vitamin D3 experienced significantly less telomere shortening compared to those taking a placebo, suggesting a potential way to protect the body at the cellular level. While further research is needed to confirm these findings and determine the impact on different populations, the study offers a promising strategy for countering the aging process. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English government is shifting its apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, redirecting resources from postgraduate-level programs. This change aims to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults and those needing to retrain, utilizing increased charges on employers recruiting from outside the UK. Funding will be pulled from level 7 apprenticeships, which are equivalent to a master's degree and used by professionals in fields like accounting and healthcare. Critics argue that this decision will harm public services and limit career opportunities for those who do not attend university, while the government asserts it will strengthen the economy by investing in skills for young people.</p>

Despite facing an ethics censure that led to his resignation as committee chairman, Rangel remained a respected and influential figure, known for his gregarious nature and commitment to his constituents. His legacy includes advocating for economic development in Harlem and pushing for policies that benefited his community and the nation.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches to understand and mitigate the increasing noise pollution from frequent spaceflights. With companies like SpaceX launching rockets regularly, the sonic booms from returning boosters are disrupting communities. Researchers are investigating the complex propagation of sound waves to determine acceptable noise levels and inform strategies for reducing disruptions. This research is especially crucial as SpaceX tests Starship, the largest and potentially loudest rocket ever built, aiming for frequent launches that could exacerbate noise issues if not addressed proactively.</p>

          <p>King Charles's visit to Canada is interpreted as a subtle assertion of Canadian sovereignty amid strained relations with the United States. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation for Charles to open Parliament, a task typically performed by the governor-general, is seen as a deliberate emphasis on Canada's distinct heritage. This visit comes at a time when President Trump has made remarks suggesting Canada would be better off as a U.S. state. The King's presence and the ceremonial events are intended to reinforce Canada's independent identity and its historical ties to Britain.</p>
