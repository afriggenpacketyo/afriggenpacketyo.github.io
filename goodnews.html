        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing policy of allowing two free checked bags, joining other major U.S. airlines in charging baggage fees. This change comes after years of Southwest differentiating itself with this perk, but the increasing revenue from baggage fees across the industry has put pressure on the airline to adapt. Along with the baggage fee change, Southwest is also introducing basic economy tickets and modifying its open seating policy as part of a broader business model overhaul. Travelers should be aware of the new policies taking effect as they plan their future Southwest flights. </p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's office has dismissed an incident in Hanoi where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon arrival in Vietnam. Video footage of the event circulated online, prompting various interpretations, but Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the images. Later, Macron told reporters that it was simply a joke between him and his wife, while a close associate described it as a harmless "squabble." This article explains that the incident occurred as Macron began a Southeast Asian tour aimed at positioning France as a reliable alternative to the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders sent a message to his players and staff, urging them to stay safe and make responsible decisions during the Memorial Day holiday. This article notes that Sanders' reminder comes amid cryptic messages he has posted on X, addressing "false stories." The coach has faced increased scrutiny since his son's NFL draft position, and this article suggests the online criticism has affected the family. Sanders encourages the younger generation to form their own opinions rather than relying on negativity directed at his father.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British businesses are reportedly rebranding diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to avoid unwanted political attention amid a right-wing backlash. Companies are reframing policies as "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" and changing job titles to reflect these new priorities. This article notes that some US-headquartered firms are scaling back DEI commitments and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly. While a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act, the article suggests the shift is driven by concerns about legal risk and employee pressure to maintain inclusive policies.</p>

          <p>Five years after the anti-police protests sparked by George Floyd's death, initiatives focused on officer mental health are gaining momentum. This article notes that the protests exacerbated the already poor state of officers' mental health, bringing the issue into the public eye. Police departments are implementing wellness programs, such as peer support teams, mental health debriefings, and wellness rooms, to address the trauma and stress associated with the job.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the need to rethink our relationship with the natural world in the face of climate change, advocating for a shift from viewing nature as inert to recognizing its inherent aliveness. It explores the concept of the Rights of Nature movement and how granting basic rights to natural entities like rivers can lead to a more sustainable relationship with the environment. The article draws on Robert Macfarlane's book, *Is a River Alive?*, to emphasize the importance of time, attention, and humility in understanding the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world. It emphasizes the need to move past Cartesian thinking.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion during Donald Trump's second term, the United States possesses several unique traits that bolster its resilience. The article points to a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that resists rapid change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a speech-protective legal tradition. These features, while potentially cumbersome in ordinary times, provide a strong defense against authoritarian overreach and ensure that the system remains easier to defend and worth defending. The article emphasizes that these factors make the American system easier to defend.</p>
