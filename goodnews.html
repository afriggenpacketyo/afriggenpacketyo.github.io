          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed delegates at the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, emphasizing the critical state of the world's oceans due to issues like collapsing fish stocks, rising sea levels, and plastic pollution. The High Seas Treaty, adopted in 2023, aims to protect roughly two-thirds of the world's oceans by allowing countries to establish protected marine areas in international waters, requiring ratification by at least 60 countries to take effect. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted that 50 countries have ratified the treaty, with 15 more promising to do so, while Guterres cautioned against deep-sea mining, warning it could turn the seabed into a "wild west," and Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva criticized the "predatory race" for critical minerals on the ocean floor. The article highlights the importance of the treaty for marine conservation and the need for substantial investment in ocean health. The article also touches on the absence of a US delegation at the conference, investment needs, and actions taken by small island nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us." Lively had filed a lawsuit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios, claiming she was sexually harassed and faced retaliation, also detailing the allegations in a New York Times article. Baldoni then sued Lively, Ryan Reynolds, their publicist, and the New York Times, alleging they aimed to ruin his career with false allegations. The judge ruled that Baldoni had not adequately proven extortion or defamation, and that the New York Times did not act with malice. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is splitting into two companies: Streaming and Studios, and Global Networks, the latter of which will house TNT Sports. The move raises questions about the future of live sports currently held by TNT, such as NCAA's March Madness, the French Open, and NASCAR. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver for HBO Max sign-ups, suggesting TNT Sports might separate from the streaming service. Gunnar Wiedenfels, the future CEO of Global Networks, will decide how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, including potential licensing deals or a merger with another entity. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to reinstate the winter fuel payment for over three-quarters of pensioners in England and Wales, specifically those with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less, has elicited varied reactions. Some pensioners, like Bob Pritchard, express relief as the payment helps cover essential expenses like hospital travel, while others, such as Alice George, believe the money should be directed towards initiatives like the NHS or tackling the housing crisis. Ian Bryant supports the decision despite not being eligible himself, while Gail Impey, whose income slightly exceeds the threshold, laments missing out on the payment after struggling to afford heating last winter. Mike Hodges suggests lowering the income threshold to allocate funds to initiatives for younger people.</p>
