          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.8 billion, making it the game's second-largest prize in history, following the absence of a winning ticket in Wednesday night's $1.4 billion drawing. The estimated cash value for Saturday's drawing stands at $826.4 million, with the top prize continuing to grow as anticipation builds and more tickets are purchased nationwide. Powerball officials emphasize playing responsibly, highlighting that each $2 ticket contributes to supporting various good causes within communities. The odds of securing the grand prize remain challenging at 1 in 292.2 million, with drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from the US and China has developed a novel method for launching millimetre-scale robots using the energy released from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that, upon collapse, generate a strong propulsive force. By precisely controlling the laser, researchers can manipulate the launch and movement of these tiny jumpers, even enabling them to swim in water. This study demonstrates cavitation as an efficient mechanism for propulsion, offering new possibilities for micro-robotics.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick, in his inaugural collegiate coaching role, achieved his first win as head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels, leading them to a 20-3 victory over the Charlotte 49ers. The team's defense was a key factor, shutting down Charlotte after an early field goal, following a quick 51-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Gio Lopez. This win helps to alleviate some of the criticism Belichick faced after a season-opening loss and ongoing discussions about his personal life. The Tar Heels now look to build momentum with upcoming home games.</p>

This victory marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam trophy and her first major title of the year, overcoming previous defeats in the Australian and French Open finals where emotional composure was a challenge. Despite some late-match tension, Sabalenka maintained a steady level and dominated the tie-break, showcasing her growth in managing pressure. Anisimova, while improved from her Wimbledon final, struggled with consistency and the Arthur Ashe Stadium floodlights, ultimately falling short in an absorbing final.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are increasingly adopting Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, with millions of students now required to store their devices. This measure aims to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment, addressing concerns from educators and parents about students' focus. While some students welcome the change, others are devising ways to circumvent the restrictions, and the cost of the pouches has sparked debate over school budget allocations. The company and school officials hope the system will create a positive culture shift, promoting face-to-face interaction and critical thinking among students.</p>

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin served as a significant diplomatic platform for China to project its vision for a multipolar global order. President Xi Jinping aimed to bolster China's geopolitical standing as a reliable alternative for global stability, particularly amidst perceived US credibility issues under President Trump. The summit, which included leaders from Russia and India, highlighted the SCO's focus on combating terrorism and integrating economic initiatives like the Belt and Road. This gathering underscored China's strategic efforts to reshape international governance and foster alliances, conveying a subtle yet unambiguous message about its evolving place in the international system.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan was gifted special baseball memorabilia after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him during a game. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, who received it from his father, before the woman confronted the father, claiming the ball was hers and ultimately taking it. Both the Phillies and Marlins organizations responded to the viral incident by providing the boy with a gift bag of team swag and arranging a meeting with outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, for an autographed bat. The Phillies also won the game 9-3, making it a memorable night despite the initial dispute.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, a party often perceived as a "one-man-band" led by Nigel Farage, is actively working to expand its pool of senior elected politicians and candidates. At its recent conference, the party showcased emerging figures like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with their old party. Reform aims to secure significantly more seats in future elections and is implementing a more rigorous vetting process for its growing number of hopefuls. This strategy is crucial for the party's ambition to increase its electoral footprint and challenge the established political landscape.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for increased recognition and support for women who served in dangerous front-line military roles. She co-founded "Sisters in Service," a community interest company that provides peer support for female veterans, particularly those now working in healthcare. Dr. Bennett highlights that many people hold outdated views, failing to understand the unique challenges and experiences of women in modern conflicts. The group aims to create a "cathartic" environment where women can connect and discuss their shared military journeys, addressing the isolation many feel after leaving service and challenging misconceptions.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, which will track when non-EU citizens enter and leave the Schengen Area. Designed to enhance security and streamline travel, EES will replace manual passport stamping and require first-time travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo. Concerns have been raised about potential long queues during the initial registration phase, particularly at busy points like Dover and Eurostar terminals. The system will be phased in over six months, with full implementation expected by April 2026, aiming for long-term efficiency despite initial hurdles.</p>
