          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. will possess a "golden share" in U.S. Steel following its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, asserting that this share would grant the U.S. control over the company. However, the specifics of this arrangement remain unclear, as neither the White House, U.S. Steel, nor Nippon have provided detailed information on the deal's structure or timeline. The United Steelworkers union has also expressed concerns, demanding clarity on whether the proposed partnership significantly differs from Nippon's initial plan to acquire U.S. Steel as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Trump mentioned that he has yet to approve the final deal with Nippon, leaving the details of the agreement uncertain. Optimism score is assigned based on the potential for U.S. control over a key industry. </p>

          <p>A new study by LendingTree reveals significant variations in tipping rates across U.S. states, with New Hampshire residents tipping the most at an average of 16.07% of spending on food away from home. The study suggests that tipping rates are higher in states where people dine out more frequently. Washington D.C. follows New Hampshire with an average tip of 12.65%, while Utah residents tip the least at 4.09%. The analysis highlights the role of tipping in subsidizing income for service workers, particularly given the federal minimum wage for tipped workers is $2.13 an hour. </p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that HELOC interest rates are experiencing fluctuations, with the average rate currently at 8.22%. Homeowners considering a HELOC should consider the volatility in the interest rate climate, which is influenced by the Federal Reserve's rate cut policies. Fixed-rate home equity loans offer a stable alternative, providing peace of mind in an unpredictable rate environment. Other alternatives, such as cash-out refinancing and reverse mortgages, may also be beneficial depending on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that families can sue for compensation when federal law enforcement conducts wrong-house raids, causing emotional and physical harm. The decision revives a lawsuit by Trina Martin and Toi Cliatt, whose home was mistakenly raided by the FBI in 2017. Justice Neil Gorsuch stated that the Federal Tort Claims Act permits some suits for wrong-house raids, especially when an officer commits an assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, or abuse of process. The ruling confirms that victims of federal abuse have a tool to seek accountability. </p>
