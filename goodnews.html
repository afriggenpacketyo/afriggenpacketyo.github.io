          <p>A Saturday NCAA baseball game between Samford and Mercer descended into disarray after a two-run homer by Samford's Michael Gupton led to heated exchanges and multiple ejections. Gupton's apparent taunting of Mercer players sparked a confrontation, resulting in his ejection along with Mercer shortstop Bradley Frye. The situation escalated further with the ejection of coaches and even Frye's mother, causing a 25-minute delay. Samford ultimately won the game 5-1, securing their spot in the SoCon championship game; the game's events highlight the intensity and passion often found in collegiate sports.</p>
