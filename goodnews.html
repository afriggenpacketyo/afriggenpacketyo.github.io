          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., expressing concerns that budget cuts could negatively impact the Indian Health Service (IHS). The senators highlighted that American Indians and Alaska Natives already face significant health disparities, and further cuts could exacerbate these issues. They urged the Secretary to ensure that IHS programs have adequate resources and staffing to fulfill their missions, and to engage in meaningful consultation with Tribal communities before making any further decisions affecting healthcare delivery.</p>

          <p>Melania Trump has spent minimal time at the White House since her husband's inauguration, preferring to reside in Trump Tower in Manhattan or Mar-a-Lago in Florida. This limited presence has led to speculation and questions about her role as First Lady. While administration officials claim she visits the White House more often than publicly known, they provide no specific details regarding her schedule or duration of stays. This absence has drawn comparisons to Greta Garbo's reclusive nature.</p>

          <p>A new study has found an association between high consumption of ultraprocessed foods and an increased likelihood of developing early symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Ultraprocessed foods are defined as those containing ingredients not typically found in a home kitchen. The study, which analyzed data from nearly 43,000 health professionals, revealed that those who consumed the most ultraprocessed foods were approximately 2.5 times more likely to exhibit at least three early Parkinson's symptoms. While the study does not prove causation, it suggests a potential link between diet and brain health.</p>

          <p>The decision to renew a maturing certificate of deposit (CD) account is more complex in the current interest rate climate, with potential rate cuts looming. While rate cuts appear likely, the rate cut trajectory could easily change, so avoiding a high-rate CD may not be the best move. Even with cuts, they are likely to be small, and losing the interest-earning opportunity in the interim can be detrimental.
