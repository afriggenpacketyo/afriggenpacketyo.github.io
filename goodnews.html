          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran confirmed he spoke with President Donald Trump before this week's interest rate decision but stated he was not pressured on how to vote. Miran, who dissented from the committee's quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger half-point reduction, emphasized that his decision was made independently. The conversation has drawn scrutiny amid ongoing concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence from political influence, particularly as Trump has been openly critical of the central bank's policies and its chair, Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment and its subsidiary Ticketmaster. The suit alleges the companies facilitated a system where ticket brokers could acquire large quantities of tickets and resell them at highly inflated prices, harming consumers. The complaint also accuses the companies of deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics and violating the Better Online Ticket Sales Act. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit filed in May, intensifying regulatory pressure on the live entertainment giant.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence boom, led by Nvidia's massive growth, has intensified investor interest in the semiconductor industry, leading to more specialized exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While traditional funds like the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) remain popular, newer options provide different strategies, such as equal-weighting to reduce single-stock risk or focusing on "fabless" chip designers. This trend allows investors to make more targeted bets on the continued expansion of the AI and chip sectors, which some analysts believe is still in its early stages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised that it's time for investors to adopt a more bullish perspective on Apple, citing strong early demand for the new iPhone 17 models and iPhone Air. Following an interview with CEO Tim Cook, Cramer pointed to better-than-expected pre-order numbers and positive commentary as indicators that Wall Street's initial sales estimates may be too conservative. He suggested that the combination of strong consumer interest and carrier incentives could make this a "breakout moment" for the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has expressed a minority view within the Federal Open Market Committee, stating that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs are causing significant macroeconomic inflation. Miran, who recently dissented from a quarter-point rate cut by advocating for a larger reduction, argued there is no clear evidence that tariffs have materially increased overall inflation rates. He also suggested that changes in immigration policy, specifically a reduction in new arrivals, would likely have a more substantial disinflationary effect on the economy by easing shelter prices.</p>

          <p>The future of TikTok in the U.S. may depend on a licensing agreement for its powerful and closely guarded recommendation algorithm, a major point of contention in talks between the U.S. and China. Previously, the Chinese government had vowed to block any sale of the algorithm, which is central to the app's success. A potential deal could involve a U.S. entity licensing the technology from parent company ByteDance, but this arrangement raises questions about data security and whether it would fully resolve national security concerns that prompted the U.S. law mandating a sale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has decreased for homeowners. A $50,000 HELOC with a 10-year term now has an average monthly payment of around $608, down from approximately $640 before the rate reduction. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they adjust with changes in the central bank's policy, making them potentially more affordable in a falling-rate environment compared to fixed-rate home equity loans, though this also exposes borrowers to risk if rates rise.

While the current average 30-year fixed rate of 6.13% has already increased home affordability, further reductions could provide significant savings for both new homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance their existing loans.
