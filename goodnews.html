          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army is set to replace its helicopters with a new tiltrotor aircraft, known as "FLRAA," to enhance its Future Long-Range Air Assault capabilities, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. This aircraft, based on the V-280 Valor prototype, combines the vertical takeoff and landing of a helicopter with the speed and range of an airplane, boasting a 1,700 nautical mile range and a 300 mph speed, far exceeding the Black Hawk helicopter's capabilities. The Army aims to expedite the aircraft's deployment to 2028, and the FLRAA is designed as a multi-mission platform equipped with door guns and the ability to launch various drones for self-protection, target hunting, and electronic warfare. The aircraft may also be able to self-deploy autonomously as an unmanned aircraft, rejoining with crews at a forward location.</p>

          <h2>Study Examines the Rise of Doomsday Prepping in American Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university-level investigation into doomsday-prepping kits, particularly those marketed by Silicon Valley startups, reveals that preparing for adverse events has become increasingly mainstream in American culture. FEMA surveys indicate that about half of Americans engage in some form of preparedness, driven by a combination of factors including the American tradition of self-sufficiency and a perceived lack of adequate government response to disasters. While extreme prepping is often sensationalized in media, it reflects a broader anxiety about societal collapse and a desire for individual responsibility in the face of potential crises. The ultra-wealthy engage in conspicuous consumption through elaborate preparation plans, which trickles down to middle-class Americans, who also participate in the preparedness market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with the challenges of parenthood and a lack of structural support for families in the U.S., some adults are choosing to create intentional "villages" by living near close friends and raising their children together. This arrangement, reminiscent of historical alloparenting practices, provides parents with much-needed support, shared child care responsibilities, and deeper friendships. While such setups require coordination, foresight, and may involve compromises, many parents find the benefits of shared parenting and community outweigh the difficulties. Some families share homes, others live in close proximity, and some reside in co-housing communities, each adapting the architecture of family life to include chosen connections.</p>

          <p>As part of an evolving trade agreement with the U.S., British plane parts, including Rolls-Royce engines, may be exempted from U.S. import tariffs, providing a boost to the UK's ¬£40 billion aerospace sector. The agreement, which follows relief for the car and steel industries, aims to prevent job losses and provide certainty to the aerospace industry, which supports 450,000 jobs in the UK. The U.S. also benefits from the deal, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners, and U.S.-based repair facilities require a steady flow of parts.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the significant role siblings play in shaping each other's personalities and academic achievements, often more powerfully than parents realize, with the "sibling spillover effect" being especially influential in disadvantaged families. The piece challenges the validity of birth-order psychology, suggesting that qualities attributed to birth order are often due to developmental stages rather than inherent traits. The article also touches on the impact of genetic predispositions, which can influence individuals to seek environments that reinforce their natural inclinations, ultimately affecting their personalities and life outcomes, and it is adapted from Susan Dominus's new book, ‚ÄúThe Family Dynamic.</p>

          <p>After a century of increasing life expectancy, the U.S. has experienced a decline in recent years, but scientific advances offer hope for reversing this trend. Simple steps, such as knowing and lowering one's biological age through proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores, adopting a Mediterranean-style diet, prioritizing deep sleep, engaging in strength training, and maintaining social connections, can significantly improve health and longevity. These evidence-based strategies, detailed in Dr. Eric Topol's book 'Super Agers,' emphasize the importance of proactive lifestyle changes over reliance on futuristic technologies for living a longer, healthier life.</p>

The changes to visa and recruitment laws are expected to decrease lower-skilled worker visas by up to 50,000 over the next year. The government will also implement a new fair pay agreement for care workers to attract domestic talent, while making some changes to rules around international students and graduates.</p>
