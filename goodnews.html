The company, established in May, has applied to list under Chapter 21, a rule designed for investment firms to raise funds from institutional investors. Li, who stepped down as CEO of HKEX in 2021, aims to use the proceeds to invest in start-ups and companies with cash flow, providing returns to shareholders. The listing application underscores the strong momentum for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, with 43 new applications received this month, bringing the total number of hopefuls to 200.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to legally reduce import duties by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-tariff categories. Customs lawyers and supply chain experts note this practice, which predates Trump, has become more prevalent as tariffs increase. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements, hoodie makers switching to cotton, and footwear companies adding fuzzy-felt fabric to soles. However, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation, as demonstrated by Ford's case involving the misclassification of cargo vans. (not investment advice)</p>
