          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second straight Stanley Cup title with a decisive 5-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, marking the NHL‚Äôs first repeat champions since Tampa Bay in 2020 and 2021. Sam Reinhart's remarkable four-goal performance, including a hat-trick, ignited the crowd, while Matthew Tkachuk sealed the win. Goalie Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance, stopping 28 of 29 shots, stifled the Oilers' offense, and the Panthers' strong lineup depth proved too much for Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl to overcome. Florida's dominant playoff run showcased their evolution into a modern-day dynasty, and they have won 11 of 12 playoff series since Tkachuk joined the team. </p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations center" for the digital yuan in Shanghai, aiming to boost the renminbi's global reach, according to People‚Äôs Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This measure is among eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, reflecting China's efforts to expand the yuan's overseas adoption amid growing tensions with the United States. Pan emphasized the need for improvements in the traditional cross-border payment system and highlighted China's progress in building a multi-channel renminbi clearing network. The trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals needing to renew, apply for a new passport, or change their name or sex designation to choose their identified gender, including selecting "X" on the application. The executive order, issued by President Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection of gender. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory, and the judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their case.</p>

          <p>Tom Homan, the Trump administration's border czar, asserts that President Trump's leadership has resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history, citing a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day. Homan contrasts this with the Biden administration, which allegedly released the "vast majority" of illegal immigrants encountered back into the U.S. Homan advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to further secure the border and facilitate deportations. Homan's numbers highlight a trend since Trump's return to office, with a significantly lower number of illegal immigrants being released compared to the Biden years.</p>

          <p>Companies in China's booming humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a deepening talent crunch. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with roles requiring more than five years of experience reaching 38,489 yuan. This contrasts with a subdued hiring landscape in other sectors due to slowing economic growth and corporate earnings.

          <p>Endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could see a resurgence in UK waters as they adapt to rising ocean temperatures, according to scientists. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, with many creatures potentially finding new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to safeguard species as habitats shift due to climate change.</p>
