          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 08:45:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs and Bank of New York Mellon have partnered to allow institutional clients to purchase tokenized money market funds, a significant step in digitizing the $7.1 trillion industry. This innovation allows fund ownership to be recorded on a blockchain, offering a yield-bearing alternative to stablecoins and enabling more seamless and efficient transactions. Major fund companies like BlackRock and Fidelity have already signed on. The banks envision these tokenized assets will enhance liquidity and could eventually be used as collateral, transforming the financial system's underlying infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 08:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in South Korea have developed a discreet, temporary tattoo-like sticker capable of quickly detecting GHB, a drug commonly used to spike drinks. The sticker contains an indicator that changes color almost instantly when exposed to a droplet of a beverage containing the substance. This innovation offers a faster and more subtle alternative to existing test strips, which can be slow and conspicuous. While experts praise the development as a proactive safety tool, they also caution that further testing is required to ensure reliability and prevent false positives before it becomes widely available.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Aggressive Tariff Strategy with Japan is Yielding Results</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 08:35:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC analysis suggests the new US-Japan trade deal, which sets a 15% tariff on Japanese goods, represents a tangible result for the Trump administration's aggressive trade tactics. The agreement is viewed as the "least worst deal" for Japan and could serve as a domino, influencing other economic blocs like the EU to negotiate similar terms. While the deal averts a threatened 25% tariff and provides certainty, questions remain about its broader economic impact, including who ultimately bears the cost of the tariffs and the effect of a weakening US dollar.

          <p>This article reports the current market price of gold and examines the various factors that influence its value, establishing it as a historically stable, safe-haven asset. It explains that the price is affected by fundamental principles of supply and demand, as well as broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.

However, with the team facing potential fatigue after two consecutive extra-time matches, some analysts argue that fresh legs are essential for the final showdown.</p>

The men had argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then considered normal commercial practices, scapegoated to appease public anger following the 2008 financial crisis.
