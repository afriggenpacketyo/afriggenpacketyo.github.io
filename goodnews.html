          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a 25 basis point interest rate trim and lowered its inflation expectations, citing a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the 2% ECB target rate in May, hitting 1.9%. The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, compared to a previous forecast of 2.3%. Despite the rate cut, economic growth remains lackluster, with the euro zone expanding by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
