          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic secured a dominant straight-sets victory over British veteran Dan Evans in the second round of Wimbledon. Djokovic's powerful performance left Evans, who may be playing in his final Wimbledon, with few opportunities. The 38-year-old Serbian is aiming for a record-equaling eighth men's singles title at the tournament. In other matches, British wildcards Jack Pinnington Jones and Arthur Fery were both eliminated from the tournament after being defeated in straight sets by their Italian opponents, ending their respective runs on their home turf.</p>

          <p>An American novelist and her husband are facing potential charges in France for their alleged involvement in selling gold bars plundered from a French shipwreck that sank in 1746. French prosecutors have requested a trial for the couple, who are accused of helping a French diver illegally sell the historic bullion online. The gold was traced back to the wreck of 'Le Prince de Conty' after it appeared at a U.S. auction. The couple denies any wrongdoing, claiming they were unaware of the gold's illicit origins and did not profit from the sales.</p>

          <p>A small plane carrying 14 skydivers and a pilot crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in New Jersey, but miraculously, all 15 people on board survived. Emergency crews declared a mass casualty incident, and while some injuries were reported as severe, there were no fatalities. Officials reported that the pilot experienced engine trouble and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred in a wooded area. The same aircraft was involved in a 2023 incident in Virginia where it sustained substantial damage during a landing, which the NTSB attributed to pilot error.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was overwhelmingly driven by hiring in the government and healthcare sectors, which together accounted for nearly nine out of every ten new jobs created. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, government payrolls grew by 73,000, primarily at the state and local levels in education. The healthcare and social assistance sector followed closely, adding over 58,000 positions. This strong growth in public and health-related fields offset job losses in other areas, such as professional services, manufacturing, and wholesale trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating the labor market's continued strength despite broader economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February. Job growth was led by the government and healthcare sectors, which compensated for federal job cuts and weakness in other industries. This resilient performance makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rate policy as it monitors the potential economic impact of newly imposed tariffs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding between a long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account, the choice involves a trade-off between rate security and flexibility. While current high-yield savings rates are slightly higher, they are variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. In contrast, a CD locks in a fixed interest rate for its entire term, providing predictable returns but penalizing early withdrawals. Calculations show a high-yield savings account currently earns slightly more on paper, but a CD may prove more profitable if rates drop as expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Throughout history, older generations have consistently expressed concern, and often condescension, towards the youth of their time. This article reflects on this recurring theme, citing examples from The Atlantic's own archives, such as a 1925 piece lamenting modern dancing and dress, and a 1975 story describing hippies as incompetent. The author, a Millennial turning 30, contemplates the fine line between empathetic observation and judgmental scrutiny when writing about generational trends. The piece concludes that the key is to approach the subject with nuance and humility, avoiding stereotypes while documenting genuine societal shifts.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer views the strong June jobs report as a victory for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, arguing the data proves Powell was right to resist President Trump's demands for an immediate interest rate cut. With better-than-expected job growth and a lower unemployment rate, Cramer asserts there is no economic justification for easing monetary policy at this time. In an overbought market, Cramer also suggested that investors might consider trimming profits from high-flying stocks, pointing to Broadcom and certain bank stocks as potential candidates for profit-taking.
