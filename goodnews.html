          <p>Philippine President Marcos and outgoing Chinese envoy Huang Xilian have emphasized that South China Sea disputes should not define the broader relationship between their nations. During Huang's farewell, Marcos called for continued deepening of trade, people-to-people interactions, and cultural exchanges. The Chinese embassy echoed this sentiment, hoping the Philippines would work towards normalizing relations. This language mirrors previous joint statements aimed at de-escalating maritime tensions and fostering cooperation despite ongoing disagreements in the contested region.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has seen its shares climb over 32% since April, diminishing earlier speculation of a takeover by rivals like Shell or Exxon Mobil. This improved sentiment is attributed to a strategic reset, a leadership change, progress in cost-cutting, and recent oil discoveries. CEO Murray Auchincloss emphasized the company's focus on growth, which he believes will drive shareholder value. Analysts also point to the appointment of a new chair with a track record of successful turnarounds as a significant catalyst for BP's renewed market confidence.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart Welcomes Drop in Labubu Toy Resale Prices, Prioritizing Accessibility Over Profit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese toy company Pop Mart is pleased that resale prices for its popular Labubu monster toys are declining, stating that the crash aligns with their goal of making art accessible to true fans, rather than supporting scalpers. After experiencing extreme markups and even a heist, Pop Mart ramped up production, leading to a significant drop in secondary market prices. Analysts suggest this pivot aims for a more sustainable model, preventing alienation of long-term customers and ensuring the brand avoids being a "one-hit wonder," despite a recent dip in Pop Mart's stock.</p>

          <p>China has inaugurated its digital yuan international operations center in Shanghai, signaling a major push to encourage the currency's use in cross-border payments and overseas markets. The People's Bank of China highlighted three platforms designed to accelerate the digital yuan's internationalization, aiming to offer an alternative to the US dollar-dominated financial architecture. These platforms include a cross-border digital payment system, a blockchain service platform for on-chain payments, and a digital asset platform to integrate existing financial infrastructure onto the blockchain.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks clinched their eighth consecutive win against the Arizona Cardinals with a dramatic 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired, securing a 23-20 victory. Quarterback Sam Darnold threw for 242 yards and a touchdown, though the Seahawks blew a 14-point fourth-quarter lead before rallying. Kyler Murray led a late Cardinals comeback with two touchdown passes, but a penalty on the ensuing kickoff set up Seattle's game-winning drive. The Seahawks' defense also sacked Murray six times in an efficient overall performance.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated he is prepared to leave office once Russia's war on Ukraine concludes, emphasizing that his primary goal is to achieve peace, not to secure another term. In an interview, he affirmed his commitment to pushing for elections during a ceasefire, despite current martial law prohibiting them. Zelenskyy, whose five-year term would have ended in May 2024 without the war, clarified that leading Ukraine in peacetime is not his personal ambition, but rather to help his country through this difficult period.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted preliminary approval for a $1.5 billion settlement between AI company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. The settlement will compensate authors approximately $3,000 per covered book and does not apply to future works. While a previous ruling found AI training on copyrighted books wasn't illegal, Anthropic was found to have wrongfully acquired materials from pirate websites. This agreement is seen as a significant step in holding AI developers accountable for intellectual property infringement.</p>

          <p>A California Senate Bill, inspired by an 8-month-old baby woken by loud commercials, aims to regulate the volume of advertisements on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video. Federal law already governs traditional TV ad volume, but streaming platforms are exempt. Due to California's market influence, if Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill, it could effectively set a nationwide standard, forcing streaming companies to control ad loudness. The Motion Picture Association opposes the bill, citing complexities in managing diverse ad sources, but proponents argue the industry can adapt.</p>
