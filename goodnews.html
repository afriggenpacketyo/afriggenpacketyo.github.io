        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent U.S. trade agreements under President Trump have consistently featured large orders for Boeing aircraft from partner nations like South Korea, Japan, and the UK. Experts suggest these high-value, high-profile deals serve both symbolic and pragmatic purposes, allowing countries to visibly reduce trade surpluses with the U.S. while fulfilling a genuine need for new planes in a growing international tourism market. Despite Boeing's recent safety scandals, its status as an iconic American company in a duopolistic market with Airbus makes it a strategic component of these international negotiations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams used his tradition of painting his fingernails to share a powerful message before the team's season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. His nails featured the suicide prevention logo and the "988" number for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, continuing a practice he's known for since his college days. Williams, who had paused the tradition during a difficult rookie season, explained his return to the practice as an unapologetic expression of his personality and confidence. The gesture highlights his use of a public platform to raise awareness for mental health issues.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a new visa category on October 1, aimed at attracting global talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The policy is designed to offer greater flexibility and fewer barriers for international professionals, signaling a strategic effort to enhance the country's innovation and competitiveness in high-tech sectors. For foreign students and professionals already in China, like Pakistani PhD student Rahdar Hussain Afridi, the new visa offers a path to remain and work in the country after graduation. Observers note that the success of the initiative will depend on effective implementation and supporting policies.</p>

Before her breakout performance on MTV's "The Cut" in 1998, she was repeatedly rejected by record labels who couldn't market her powerful voice and distinct look. She shares anecdotes from her career, including being asked by Arnold Schwarzenegger to sing the same song twelve times at his birthday party. Now touring, she reflects on her enduring appeal and the satisfaction of finally connecting with audiences after being initially blocked from playing live in her early career.</p>

          <h2>Study Shows Significant Increase in Cannabis Use Among Older Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 20:06:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, according to a recent study. With cannabis now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, the stigma surrounding it is diminishing, and many seniors are turning to it for medicinal purposes like pain relief and relaxation. However, some medical professionals caution against potential health risks associated with THC, the main psychoactive compound. Research from UC San Francisco warns that smoking marijuana can harm the cardiovascular system, and other studies have linked cannabis use to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have activated third baseman Max Muncy from the injured list, providing a much-needed boost to the team's slumping offense. Muncy, who missed 23 games with an oblique injury, was immediately placed back in the cleanup spot for the game against the Colorado Rockies. His return is seen as critical for the Dodgers, who posted a losing record during his absence and have struggled at the plate recently. Muncy is the first of several key players expected to return from injury soon, which could help the team regain momentum heading into the playoff stretch.</p>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new transit center and a "durian express" shipping service to deliver the popular fruit from Southeast Asia to the country's northeast region faster. The initiative aims to reduce shipping times from nearly two weeks to as little as six days, ensuring the freshness of the perishable fruit for the roughly 100 million consumers in the area. This logistical upgrade addresses the challenge of supplying a market that is geographically distant from traditional entry points like Guangzhou and Shenzhen. The project is expected to handle approximately 10,000 shipping containers of fresh durians annually.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill aimed at closing a loophole that allows online dealers and brokers to sell dogs from out-of-state commercial breeding facilities, often known as puppy mills. The legislation, AB 519, specifically bans sales from brokers who act as middlemen, a practice that grew after a 2019 law prohibited pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs. The move follows a Los Angeles Times investigation that exposed how resellers mislead consumers by claiming puppies are from small, local breeders. If signed into law, the bill will apply to dogs, cats, and rabbits under one year old.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the latest updated COVID-19 vaccines, but with narrower eligibility criteria than in previous rollouts. The new shots are specifically authorized for adults aged 65 and older and for younger individuals with certain medical conditions that place them at higher risk of severe illness. While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the more limited formal approval may restrict access for some, particularly at pharmacies that must adhere to state regulations. Conditions that qualify for eligibility include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, covering an estimated 100 to 200 million people in the U.S.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with the public perception of his team's aggressive playing style, often labeled "Bazball." He stated that misconceptions, such as the idea that the team just swings the bat wildly without strategy, are disrespectful to the hard work and determination of the players and staff. McCullum clarified that his coaching philosophy is about creating an environment that allows players to perform without being restricted by pressure, rather than enforcing a rigid, high-risk playing style. He emphasized that the ultimate goal is to create the best conditions for the team to succeed.</p>

          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the top vote-getter in a closely contested parliamentary election. With around 28% of the vote, Labour and its four left-wing allies secured a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused on domestic issues like the cost of living and public services, as well as international instability. While the ruling coalition's majority shrank, the result allows Stoere to continue leading the government, signaling a victory for social democracy amid a broader right-wing trend in Europe.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several recent pessimistic narratives on Wall Street that he argues proved to be unfounded, particularly concerning major technology companies. He pointed to fears that Alphabet would be punitively broken up by a monopoly ruling, concerns about Amazon's web services falling behind, and worries over Apple's AI strategy, noting that all three stocks ultimately recovered from these negative sentiments. Cramer also addressed a recent price target cut for Nvidia, suggesting it might be another instance of overhyped negativity that investors will later see as a mistake. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has resolved its succession dispute with a $3.3 billion settlement that solidifies Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement ends a legal battle initiated after Rupert Murdoch attempted to amend his family trust to ensure his eldest son would be his sole successor. Under the deal, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares and roles in the companies in exchange for cash, ensuring the conservative editorial direction of outlets like Fox News will be maintained. The resolution dissolves the old family trust and establishes new ones that cement Lachlan's leadership.</p>
