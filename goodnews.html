        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Formula 1 has confirmed the six locations that will host sprint races during the 2026 season, with Silverstone in Great Britain and Singapore being notable inclusions. Silverstone returns to the sprint calendar for the first time since 2021, while Singapore's inclusion is a surprise given the track's reputation for difficult overtaking. The other venues selected are China, Miami, Canada, and the Netherlands. F1 has maintained six sprints for 2026 due to the strain of new regulations but is considering expanding to as many as 12 sprint events from 2027 onwards to increase audience engagement and revenue.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 05:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings data from the Office for National Statistics. This rise adheres to the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees an annual increase based on the highest of inflation, earnings growth, or 2.5%. While this will provide a significant boost for nearly 13 million pensioners, concerns are growing that the rising pension amount is approaching the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. This could potentially make more retirees liable for income tax on their state pension for the first time starting in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is poised to make its most significant policy decision of the year, with economists widely predicting the first interest rate cut of 2025. The central bank faces conflicting economic signals: a slowing labor market argues for a cut, while inflation has been creeping higher, partly due to administration tariffs. This decision comes amid sustained pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs to stimulate the economy. The key focus will be on the size of the reduction and whether the Fed signals a broader pivot towards further cuts later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has reversed its controversial decision to means-test winter fuel payments, a policy that had caused the number of recipients to drop from around 11 million to just 1.3 million. Following a political backlash, the chancellor announced that the payment, worth up to £300, will again be available to the vast majority of pensioners. Under the new rules, pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will be eligible, restoring assistance for energy bills to more than three-quarters of retired individuals this winter. The move comes as energy bills are set to rise again in October. (not investment advice)</p>

On the second day, Trump will meet with Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers for bilateral talks focused on investment, technology, and financial services. Key discussion topics are expected to include a new nuclear power deal, trade tariffs, and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, with both sides aiming to strengthen the transatlantic relationship.</p>

          <p>German authorities carried out raids on the homes of suspected far-right sympathizers in the states of Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and North Rhine-Westphalia. The operation targeted a group of individuals aged 32 to 57 who were believed to possess illegal weapons. This action is part of a series of recent crackdowns on right-wing radical groups in Germany. The raids occurred as the country grapples with a cost of living crisis and political debates over the 2025 budget, following the formation of a new coalition government earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is seen as a crucial opportunity for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is currently facing significant domestic challenges. Recent turmoil, including a cabinet resignation and declining approval ratings, has put Starmer's leadership under pressure. The visit, complete with royal pageantry and high-profile trade discussions, offers a welcome distraction and a chance to secure positive news on investment and transatlantic relations. Despite political differences, Trump has shown a personal affinity for Starmer and the U.K., which London hopes to leverage for economic and diplomatic gains.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a landmark bill that will impose a legal "duty of candour" on public officials, forcing them to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation, long championed by families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough stadium disaster, aims to end a culture of cover-ups and will apply to future tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office scandal. The bill will create criminal sanctions for officials who breach this duty and provide legal funding for those affected by state-related disasters, fundamentally shifting the balance of power.</p>

Viewing the menstrual cycle as a "fifth vital sign" of health, teams like England's Red Roses and the USA Eagles use apps and daily wellness forms to monitor players. This data allows staff to make informed adjustments, such as modifying gym intensity or increasing carbohydrate intake, to mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps. The approach aims to maximize performance throughout the cycle, acknowledging the unique physiological demands on female athletes without letting it dictate their participation in training or games.</p>

Initially believing she had "freshers' flu," her condition rapidly deteriorated, leading to two cardiac arrests and a three-month coma. The life-threatening condition, meningococcal septicaemia, caused such severe damage that amputation of all four limbs was necessary. Despite the life-altering circumstances, McGarry remains positive, expressing excitement about returning to swimming and using adaptive technology, while her community raises funds to support her recovery and future opportunities.</p>

While the removal of the not proven verdict has broad support, critics argue it fails to provide closure for victims.
