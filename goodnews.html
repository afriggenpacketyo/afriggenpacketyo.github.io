          <p>A new CNBC-Generation Lab survey of nearly 18,000 young Americans highlights their professional preferences and views on major corporations. The study found a majority prefer in-office work at least three days a week, prioritizing career development and company culture over remote work flexibility. While willing to work hard, they value work-life balance and expect regular, face-to-face feedback from managers. The survey also revealed negative perceptions of companies like Tesla and Meta, which were viewed more unfavorably than Exxon Mobil.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tripadvisor surged by 10% after activist investment firm Starboard Value disclosed it had acquired a significant stake of over 9% in the online travel company. The investment, valued at approximately $160 million, has fueled speculation about potential strategic changes at Tripadvisor, which has seen its stock perform poorly recently. Starboard Value is well-known for pushing for major operational shifts, including leadership changes and cost-cutting measures, at companies where it invests. Tripadvisor had previously formed a special committee to explore its strategic options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated unexpected strength in June, adding 147,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, surpassing economists' forecasts of 110,000. This resilience was largely driven by a significant increase in government hiring, particularly at the state and local levels, which added 73,000 positions. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%, although this was partly due to a decrease in the labor force participation rate. The steady job growth and moderate wage gains have led markets to believe the Federal Reserve will likely not cut interest rates in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt has expressed high ambitions for the upcoming 2025 college football season, stating his goals are to win the Heisman Trophy and a national championship. In an interview, Leavitt discussed his motivational techniques, which include keeping a list of rival quarterbacks he aims to outperform, a strategy he learned from his brother. After a successful first season with the Sun Devils that led them to a Big XII title, he remains driven by a sense of perfectionism, feeling he can still improve significantly.

          <p>While millions of Americans are traveling for the July 4th holiday, the airline industry faces a challenging outlook for the remainder of the year due to an oversupply of flights and softening demand. Domestic airfares are reportedly at their lowest since 2021, and several major airlines have withdrawn their 2025 forecasts amid economic uncertainty and the Trump administration's tariff policies. To cope, carriers are planning to reduce unprofitable flights after the peak summer season. Despite strong international travel from the U.S., even those fares have begun to ease, adding pressure to airline revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week, indicating that layoffs remain low despite broader economic uncertainties. The Labor Department reported that initial jobless claims dropped by 4,000 to 233,000 for the week ending June 28, coming in below analysts' forecasts. This data, a key indicator of layoffs, suggests a continued tightness in the labor market. The report contrasts with some recent high-profile layoff announcements from major corporations but aligns with other data showing a resilient job market overall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the cultural significance of fireworks in America through the author's own experiences, from youthful adventures with his father to a more recent, regulation-abiding quest. The author reflects on the vast and uniquely American variety of consumer pyrotechnics, noting products themed for nearly every ideology and interest. The narrative humorously details the bureaucratic odyssey of trying to legally set off fireworks on a beach in Maine, contrasting the ease of purchase with the complexity of local ordinances. Ultimately, the piece celebrates the simple, unifying joy of a fireworks display as a core part of the nation's identity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has enacted new legislation aimed at boosting housing supply by reforming the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The new laws, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, exempt most urban, multifamily housing projects from the state's lengthy environmental review process and make it easier for cities to rezone for more development. Proponents, part of a "pro-abundance" movement, argue this will help address the state's severe housing shortage by reducing costs and delays. The move represents a significant policy shift, prioritizing development over the objections of some environmental and labor groups who have historically used CEQA to block construction.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, founder of the band Dropkick Murphys, remains outspoken in his political views, particularly his opposition to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. In a recent interview, he described confronting a Trump supporter at a concert by wagering that the fan's MAGA merchandise was not made in America, a bet he won. Casey believes it is crucial to stand up to what he sees as a "scam" that betrays working-class values, even if it means losing some fans. He also expressed a desire for the Democratic party to find candidates who can better connect with the working-class male voters they have lost.</p>
