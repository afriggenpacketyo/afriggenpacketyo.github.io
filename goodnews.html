          <p>Coca-Cola reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its shares to climb. Despite the positive results, the company acknowledged that consumer demand remains soft, particularly among low-income consumers in North America and Europe. To address this, Coke is focusing on affordable options like mini cans to maintain volume. The company's water, sports, coffee, and tea segments saw the largest volume growth, while it reiterated its full-year financial forecast.</p>

          <p>A study published in the journal Nature Electronics details the development of an analogue AI chip by Chinese researchers that could be significantly more powerful than current technology. The team claims their approach could offer 1,000 times higher throughput and 100 times better energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art digital processors like those from Nvidia. Unlike digital computing's binary system, analogue computing uses continuously variable values, which has historically been limited by precision issues that this new research aims to overcome.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Atlanta arrested a man who allegedly threatened to commit a mass shooting at the Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. The suspect's family alerted police after he streamed his intentions on social media, leading to his swift capture inside the terminal. An AR-15 rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was discovered in his truck parked outside. Officials, who identified the suspect as a felon with mental health challenges, stated that the family's intervention and quick police collaboration successfully prevented a tragedy.</p>
