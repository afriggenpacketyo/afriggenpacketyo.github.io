        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has sparked debate about the reliability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. The outage, caused by an abrupt loss of power at a substation in Granada and subsequent failures, occurred when renewables accounted for approximately 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some have blamed the country's reliance on renewables, experts suggest the incident highlights grid stability issues rather than inherent problems with renewable energy sources. The article explores potential solutions, such as virtual inertia, better battery storage, and increased grid flexibility, to improve grid stability and accommodate the growing share of renewable energy.</p>

This increase indicates that US businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies, are quickly capitalizing on the tariff reprieve by stockpiling goods.

The report highlights that AI megadeals, rounds of $100 million or greater, represented about half of all the money raised in the overall megadeal category, including companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.

          <p>A Harvard-trained pediatrician advocates for incorporating beans into children's diets, emphasizing their often-overlooked nutritional value. As a pediatrician, the author spends a lot of time engaging with families about nutrition. Their philosophy is simple: If you empower a child to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood. They note that while many parents prioritize vegetables and limiting added sugar, beans are an underrated superfood that can significantly reduce the long-term risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.</p>

          <p>Essex bowler Sam Cook is set to make his international debut for England in the upcoming Test against Zimbabwe, as confirmed by coach Brendon McCullum. Cook, known for his prolific performances in county cricket, will join an inexperienced bowling attack alongside Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, and spinner Shoaib Bashir. The match, a four-day Test and Zimbabwe's first in England since 2003, will begin at Trent Bridge on Thursday. Zak Crawley will remain as the opener, and Ollie Pope will return to number three, with Jamie Smith back as wicketkeeper after paternity leave.</p>
