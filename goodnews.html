          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes held at Saratoga Springs, New York, marking a repeat of their Derby finish. Sovereignty, with 2-to-1 odds, won the race in muddy conditions, skipping the Preakness Stakes between the Derby and Belmont, a first for any horse. Journalism, the Preakness winner and heavy favorite, finished second, while Baeza secured third place, mirroring the Derby's top three. Jockey Junior Alvarado, who also rode Sovereignty to victory at the Derby, was his mount on Saturday, despite a previous fine and suspension for his use of the riding crop in the Derby, which he is appealing.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Belmont Stakes featured a rematch of the top three finishers from the Kentucky Derby, with Sovereignty, Journalism, and Baeza competing again. Sovereignty skipped the Preakness to prepare for the Belmont, a strategy that paid off with a victory. Journalism, who won the Preakness, was the morning-line favorite for the Belmont but ultimately finished second. The Belmont was held at Saratoga Race Course instead of Belmont Park due to ongoing renovations, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles.</p>

          <p>A Zambian writing system called Sona, developed by women, is being highlighted to counter colonial narratives that Africans lacked literacy. The Women's History Museum of Zambia is using social media to showcase artifacts and knowledge systems that were suppressed during colonialism.

          <p>A parenting expert identifies five key factors that contribute to raising successful children, based on interviews with parents and research. These factors include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's interests, understanding that learning can happen anywhere, cultivating a love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than coaching. The expert emphasizes the importance of supporting children's growth and letting their own desires drive them. The shift from encouraging hard work to fostering curiosity and a love of learning is highlighted as an important development in developmental psychology.</p>
