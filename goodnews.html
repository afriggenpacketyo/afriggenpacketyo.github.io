          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have announced a significant reduction in the number of individuals reported missing following severe flooding earlier in the month. After extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies, the count of missing persons has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Many of those initially reported as unaccounted for have since been verified as safe. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery efforts, though the overall death toll from the statewide flooding remains over 130.</p>

          <p>England's rugby team achieved a decisive 40-5 victory against the United States in a Test match in Washington, D.C., that was significantly delayed by nearby lightning strikes. The game was paused for nearly two hours in total, with both the kick-off and a portion of the first half being held up for safety reasons. Despite the interruptions, England maintained its momentum, scoring six tries and showcasing a strong performance to conclude their tour with a perfect record. The match also served as an opportunity for several players to make their England debuts.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new law aimed at preventing mass violent attacks by individuals who are not motivated by a specific ideology. The proposed legislation seeks to close a legal gap, allowing police to intervene and charge suspects who are found to be planning attacks, similar to existing counter-terrorism powers. This initiative follows the tragic attack in Southport, where the perpetrator was not classifiable as a terrorist despite his violent intent. The new power would enable authorities to act on preparatory steps to stop potential attackers before they can act.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her song "Roar" high above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered her composure and continued with the performance without further incident, later making a lighthearted comment about the mishap. The event highlights the inherent risks of complex stage productions that utilize aerial stunts, a common feature in many large-scale concert tours.</p>

          <h2>UK Debates Merits of Shortening Traditional Six-Week Summer School Holidays</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in the UK over the potential benefits and drawbacks of shortening the traditional six-week school summer holiday. Proponents argue that a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare and financial burdens on parents, and mitigate "holiday hunger" for children relying on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend that the long break is essential for rest, rejuvenation, and planning. The discussion also touches on potential impacts on holiday costs, family time, and adapting to a changing climate with hotter summers.</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, members-only clubs is gaining popularity in India, catering to the country's growing class of "nouveau riche" entrepreneurs and creatives. These clubs, such as Soho House, offer a more contemporary alternative to traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas, which have long waiting lists and cater to old-money families. While still highly exclusive and expensive, the new clubs prioritize personal accomplishment and creative merit over family legacy for membership. This trend reflects India's changing economic landscape and the demand for networking spaces for a new generation of wealth creators.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Clippers are giving strong consideration to signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, would add significant playmaking depth and veteran leadership to the roster. The team is reportedly looking to add more ball-handlers to support James Harden and Bradley Beal. If signed, Paul would likely accept a reserve role, contributing to a deep and versatile guard rotation as the Clippers aim to build a championship-contending team.</p>
