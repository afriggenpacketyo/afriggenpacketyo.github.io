        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first significant federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation primarily targets the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating rules for banks and financial institutions to issue digital assets backed by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills. The administration and supporters in the crypto industry view this as a landmark step toward legitimizing digital currencies and integrating them into the mainstream financial system, potentially revolutionizing financial technology. The bill's passage followed some internal Republican debate, which the president claimed to have personally resolved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:43:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Policy Center indicates that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' signed by President Trump will result in tax savings for all income groups, averaging around $2,900 per household in 2026. The law extends many provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on overtime and tips. However, the report highlights that higher-income households will receive a disproportionately larger benefit, with the top 20% of earners capturing about 60% of the total tax breaks. This finding aligns with public perception that the law favors the wealthy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:42:31 EDT</div>

          <p>The price of Ether surged as President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major U.S. law regulating cryptocurrency, specifically targeting stablecoins. While Bitcoin's price remained steady, Ether saw a significant 19% weekly gain, with Ether-based ETFs experiencing record inflows, for the first time surpassing those of Bitcoin ETFs. This market shift highlights growing investor confidence in Ethereum, further bolstered by BlackRock's filing to add staking to its Ether ETF. The new law is seen by analysts as a major symbolic victory for the entire crypto industry, providing a durable legal framework for stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has sanctioned 18 Russian military intelligence officers and three GRU units for conducting a 'sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity' aimed at destabilizing Europe. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the actions were a response to Russia's hybrid threats against UK institutions and its continued aggression in Ukraine. Concurrently, the European Union announced its 18th and 'strongest' round of sanctions, targeting Russia's energy sector by lowering the oil price cap and banning transactions related to the Nord Stream pipelines. These coordinated measures aim to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin.</p>

          <h2>New US Crypto Law Explained: What Are Stablecoins and What Will the Genius Act Do?</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 15:30:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly signed Genius Act creates the first federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to be less volatile by pegging its value to assets like the U.S. dollar. The law establishes clear rules and consumer protections, allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, which supporters say will facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions. While considered safer than other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins still carry risks, such as 'depegging' from their asset, as seen during the 2023 bank failures. The legislation is expected to encourage wider adoption by major financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a deal that was contingent on the outcome of a legal dispute with Exxon Mobil. An international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, affirming that Exxon did not have a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in a massive offshore oil project in Guyana. The acquisition gives Chevron a crucial 30% share in the highly productive Stabroek Block. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, stating it upholds the industry standard that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that even high-income earners often struggle with credit card debt, largely due to lifestyle inflation where spending increases alongside salary. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for those with high salaries and good credit scores. Options include using a debt consolidation loan to secure a lower fixed interest rate or leveraging a 0% APR balance transfer credit card to pay down principal without interest. Additionally, high earners may have success negotiating directly with creditors for a lower APR or working with a financial advisor to create a comprehensive payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a historical survey of queerness, illustrating how its perception and acceptance have varied dramatically across civilizations. It highlights examples from antiquity, such as the commonality of same-sex relationships in ancient Rome and Greece, and the life of Leonardo da Vinci, who is believed to have had a long-term male partner. The text contrasts this with the severe persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which framed non-binary identities and same-sex love as sinful. The piece also explores the existence of third-gender roles in various Indigenous cultures, underscoring a long and diverse global history.</p>

          <p>American Express reported strong second-quarter spending, with transactions on its cards jumping 7%, indicating its affluent customer base continues to spend freely on goods and services. However, the company noted a specific area of weakness: spending on domestic economy class airfare was flat compared to a year ago. In contrast, spending on premium cabin flights and luxury hotels saw robust growth. This slowdown in a key travel segment, combined with declining airfare prices and increased competition in the premium card market, has raised some investor concerns despite the company's overall positive performance.

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $20,000 into either a long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current rate environment. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return over the term. Calculations show that based on today's rates, a money market account would earn slightly more over terms ranging from 18 months to five years. However, because money market rates will likely change, the guaranteed rate of a long-term CD may prove to be the safer and more lucrative option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a recent dip in its stock price driven by accelerating beef inflation, the long-term investment case for Texas Roadhouse remains strong, according to some analysts. Beef prices, a major expense for the steakhouse chain, rose 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, pressuring operating margins. However, Bank of America recently raised its price target for the company, citing expectations for continued market share gains and strong same-store sales growth. The company's best-in-class customer traffic and steady expansion are seen as key strengths that can overcome the temporary challenge of high commodity costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London, arguing that they were not murdered but survived. Langley, who previously helped locate the remains of King Richard III, led a decade-long 'Missing Princes Project' that reviewed historical archives. The research reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting the princes, Edward V and his brother Richard, lived on. This challenges the long-held narrative, popularized by Shakespeare, that their uncle Richard III had them killed to secure the throne.</p>

Investigators used modern forensic testing and re-interviewed witnesses, leading them to identify a skull found in 1997 as belonging to Peroni. She was 27 when she was last seen at a party with Sanfratello. The arrest represents a significant breakthrough in the four-decade-old case, bringing a measure of progress for a family.</p>

The measures include lowering the price cap on Russian oil, banning future transactions through the Nord Stream pipelines, and prohibiting imports of refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the sanctions target Russia's 'shadow fleet' of oil tankers and restrict exports to entities, including some in China and Turkey, that supply Russia with dual-use technologies.
