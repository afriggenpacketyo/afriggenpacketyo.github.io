          <p>Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James reportedly sustained a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee during Game 5 of the Western Conference first-round series against the Minnesota Timberwolves, according to ESPN. The injury occurred after a collision with Minnesota guard Donte DiVincenzo. James, who averaged impressive stats this season, has a player option for next season, and the Lakers anticipate his return for at least one more NBA season. This article reports that if the Lakers had continued in the playoffs, the injury would have kept James off the court for three to five weeks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed resilience in April despite the Trump administration's implementation of tariffs, with 177,000 jobs added and an unemployment rate remaining at 4.2 percent, according to the New York Times.

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, that could neutralize the venom of multiple deadly snake species, according to The New York Times. This discovery is a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom, which could save lives in regions where snakebites are a major health problem. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that two antibodies from Mr. Freide's blood, combined with a drug, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species.
