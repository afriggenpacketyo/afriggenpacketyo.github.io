          <p>The United States and China have signed a trade agreement, formalizing a framework negotiated earlier in London to de-escalate their trade war. While President Trump announced the deal, specific details remain undisclosed, but it follows a period of postponed tariff hikes. China has also begun accelerating export approvals for rare earth minerals, a key point of contention that had threatened global high-tech supply chains. The agreement aims to mitigate the economic toll the trade dispute has taken on both nations, including a contraction in the U.S. economy and falling industrial profits in China.</p>

Son revealed that he had wanted to be a major early backer before Microsoft secured the role in 2019 and now plans total investments of around $33.2 billion. He expressed his belief that OpenAI will eventually become the world's most valuable company. This strong commitment comes amid reports of friction between OpenAI and Microsoft over a potential restructuring into a for-profit entity, a move SoftBank has also pushed for.</p>

          <p>NATO has agreed to more than double its members' defense spending target to 5% of GDP by 2035 and has unveiled a new commercial space strategy, signaling major opportunities for defense and space companies.

The increased funding and strategic focus are expected to benefit companies involved in satellite communication, navigation, and surveillance, such as Planet Labs, which recently secured a NATO contract. The strategy also fuels the European push to develop alternatives to Starlink for critical communications infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has created a high-resolution "digital embryo," providing an unprecedented tool to study the complex processes of early human development. This spatiotemporal atlas maps out early organogenesis, the critical stage where a fertilized egg develops into various cell types to form organs. Researchers from institutions including Southeast University and BGI-Research believe this model will be crucial for understanding how developmental abnormalities occur, which can lead to diseases later in life.

          <p>At the World Economic Forum's 'Summer Davos' event, economists argued that China must undergo structural reforms to transition from a production-focused to a consumption-driven economy. Despite technological advances, experts like Professor Jin Keyu warned that China cannot become a truly wealthy nation without significantly increasing domestic consumption. The current model, which heavily subsidizes production, creates trade imbalances and global friction. Panelists suggested that for long-term, harmonious growth, China's local governments should begin to measure success based on consumption metrics, not just production output, to rebalance its economy.

The positive sentiment was further bolstered by gains in the U.S. Nasdaq index, driven by optimism about demand for artificial intelligence, and by an apparent holding of the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which reduced geopolitical tensions.
