          <p>A British aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, has docked in Singapore as part of a rare Pacific deployment involving multinational exercises across Australia, Japan, and Korea. Commodore James Blackmore emphasizes the deployment demonstrates the UK's commitment to a rules-based international order and trade in the Indo-Pacific region. The deployment includes participation in an Australia-led exercise with the US and other regional militaries, as well as supporting Japan's F-35 capability development. The visit follows recent criticism from China regarding a British warship's passage through the Taiwan Strait, adding a layer of geopolitical tension to the deployment.

          <p>FedEx announced better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, having achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aiming for an additional $1 billion in savings for the next fiscal year. CEO Raj Subramaniam highlighted the company's transformation initiatives focused on integrating networks and reducing costs. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance falling slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's fiscal first-quarter revenue guidance includes a $170 million headwind from international exports due to global trade policy impacts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has moved to dismiss all active gang injunctions, affecting 317 people, citing a narrowed legal definition of gang activity in California. The decision follows legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased. Sean Garcia-Leys, the center's executive director, noted that the injunctions disproportionately targeted Latino criminal organizations while ignoring white supremacist gangs.
