          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has indicated a willingness to engage in dialogue regarding rare earth export controls and has approved some export applications, signaling a potential easing of trade tensions with the United States. The ministry acknowledged the growing global demand for medium and heavy rare earths in sectors like robotics and new energy vehicles, and affirmed China's commitment to meeting legitimate civilian needs while strengthening compliance review processes. This development comes as Vice-Premier He Lifeng is expected to attend the first meeting of the US-China bilateral economic and trade consultation mechanism in London, where rare earths are anticipated to be a key discussion point. This is an effort to foster compliant trade.</p>

          <p>Mauricio Pochettino, currently the United States head coach, has dismissed speculation linking him with a return to Tottenham following the sacking of Ange Postecoglou. Despite previously managing Tottenham for five years, Pochettino stated that a return is "not realistic" given his current position. Postecoglou was sacked despite leading the club to their first piece of silverware in 17 years with victory in the Europa League. Pochettino was appointed US manager in October 2024, and says he is happy in his new role.</p>

The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, bypassing damaged photoreceptor cells. The advance, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, offers significant promise for treating human blindness, and tellurium is a byproduct of copper refining.

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong (HKU), found that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. The drastic decline in fertility rates is especially urgent in countries ‚Äúgetting old before getting rich,‚Äù and China's overall fertility rate is estimated at 1.1 children per woman, well below the level needed for a population to sustain itself. The study also found that traditional expectations that place the burden on women persist in China and other East Asian countries.</p>
