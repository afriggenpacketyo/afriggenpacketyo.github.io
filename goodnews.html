          <p>An opinion article argues that baseball legend Pete Rose should be admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame following his reinstatement to Major League Baseball. The author contends that Rose's on-field achievements, including being the all-time Hit King, outweigh his gambling transgressions, especially since his actions did not affect game outcomes. The article emphasizes that the Hall of Fame should honor greatness, not character, and that Rose's contributions to the sport deserve recognition. The author also recounts a personal anecdote about meeting Rose, highlighting his complex personality and the long-lasting impact of his career.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister has confirmed that negotiations are underway for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports. European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds emphasized the importance of easing border queues and focusing on trade, security, and youth mobility. While expressing confidence in reaching a deal on food exports, he stressed that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.' Conservative MP Alex Burghart voiced concerns that the proposed deal could lead to the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards.</p>

          <p>A deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports is being "pushed for", a government minister has confirmed. The UK and EU will hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit on Monday, described by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as a "really significant moment". But reports suggest there could also be agreements on allowing British travellers to use e-gates at European airports, cutting red tape on food exports and imports, and setting up a youth mobility scheme with the EU.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study reveals a significant decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies under seven months old, linked to the widespread availability of a vaccine for pregnant women and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalizations decreased by as much as 56% compared to pre-pandemic RSV seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. Emergency physicians noted fewer critically ill children and reduced need for intensive care. The success highlights the impact of preventative measures, though older children did not experience the same benefit.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, considered the earliest known in China, have returned to Beijing after 79 years abroad. The Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to the Warring States Period, were transferred from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States. The manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and acquired by an American collector before being gifted to the museum. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts and the museum's adoption of a new ethical returns policy.</p>

The operation was performed on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan to conduct more transplants as part of a clinical trial before expanding its use. This procedure offers an alternative to using bowel tissue, which can lead to complications.</p>
