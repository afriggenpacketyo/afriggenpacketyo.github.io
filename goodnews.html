          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant rally after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, proposed stablecoin legislation. The bill aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. Coinbase shares also rose, benefiting from interest earned on Circle's USDC reserves. The GENIUS Act is expected to enhance payment rails, improve transparency, and promote dollar dominance, while adding consumer protections and regulatory oversight for stablecoins.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Students seeking loans for the fall of 2025 can benefit from slightly decreased federal student loan rates. Federal undergraduate loan rates are set to drop to 6.39%, offering some relief, while private loans may offer more competitive rates, especially for borrowers with good credit or a cosigner. Maximizing federal funding options by completing the FAFSA is recommended before exploring private loans. Optimizing credit profiles, using a cosigner, and considering shorter repayment terms can further lower rates; comparing options from various lenders and taking advantage of discounts is crucial for securing the most affordable student loan.

          <p>The FDA has proposed a new national priority voucher plan to expedite drug reviews for companies supporting U.S. national interests. This plan aims to reduce drug review times to one to two months, significantly faster than the current 10-month standard or six-month priority review. The program targets companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While the plan is seen as potentially positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the risks of accelerated reviews and potential political influence.</p>
