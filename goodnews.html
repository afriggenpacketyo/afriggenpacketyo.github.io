        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the presence of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, marking the first such detection in the country. Fragments of the virus were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Nottinghamshire in 2023 as part of a research program. While the virus is widespread in Europe, officials emphasize that the risk to the general public is very low, with no evidence of spread in mosquitoes or people in the UK. Experts suggest that climate change is contributing to the expansion of mosquito-borne diseases into new areas, emphasizing the importance of mosquito control measures and personal protection.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that Tesla plans to deploy robotaxis on the streets of Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with intentions to expand the service to Los Angeles and San Francisco thereafter. The Tesla robotaxi service will initially consist of approximately 10 vehicles in Austin, with potential for rapid expansion if the launch proceeds smoothly. These robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk has been promising fully self-driving cars for years, though Tesla's current vehicles still require human supervision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposed tax cuts are intensifying concerns among bond investors regarding the national debt and deficit, potentially leading to higher interest rates on various types of debt. Investors were already wary of Trump's tariff policies, and the new tax cuts have heightened anxieties, causing the 10-year Treasury yield to rise above 4.5% and the 30-year yield to exceed 5%. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that volatility in the Treasury market could increase economic uncertainty. The bond market's reaction could influence Washington's decisions, but analysts suggest a significant spike in yields would be needed to impose fiscal discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has urged House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," amid internal disagreements over Medicaid and state and local tax deductions. Trump used strong language to discourage changes to Medicaid and urged Republicans to accept the current deal on SALT deductions. Speaker Mike Johnson remains confident that he can secure enough votes to pass the bill, although some hard-liners have expressed continued reservations. The bill faces further hurdles in the Senate, where Republicans are expected to make additional modifications, potentially complicating its passage in the House.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, has resigned following public criticism over his remarks about receiving free rice, which were perceived as insensitive given soaring rice prices in the country. Eto stated he had never had to purchase rice due to gifts from supporters, a comment that angered many struggling with the high cost of the staple food. The resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government faces low approval ratings and grapples with rising inflation and tariff negotiations with the U.S. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto as agriculture minister.</p>

The company's first-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, though sales slightly missed estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in stores, technology, and customer service. Lowe's expects total sales for the year to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year.

          <p>Despite being term-limited, President Trump's actions suggest he remains influenced by public opinion, contrary to fears of an emboldened second term. While some policies, such as those on immigration, seem impervious to public outcry, Trump has shown responsiveness in areas like court rulings, where he has largely complied to avoid backlash, and tariffs, which he scaled back after widespread opposition. The article suggests that public anger can still sway the administration, particularly on issues that could haunt the GOP in future elections, and that expressing discontent can prompt institutions to fight back against Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor National Park in England, rejecting an appeal by landowners who argued that permission should be required. The ruling centers on the interpretation of the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, which grants the public a right of access for open-air recreation. Campaigners celebrated the decision, while landowners expressed disappointment. The Dartmoor National Park Association welcomed the ruling and emphasized the importance of responsible access, calling on the government to consider lessons from the case in forthcoming legislation.</p>
