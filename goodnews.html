        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025," aims to protect American jobs by discouraging companies from moving call centers overseas. The legislation would require companies to notify the Department of Labor of such moves, making them ineligible for certain federal loans and grants. To protect consumers, the bill mandates that agents disclose their location and if AI is being used, with an option to transfer to a U.S.-based representative. This proposal addresses concerns about job displacement from AI and the security of consumer data.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped all charges against restaurant company Fat Brands and its chairman, Andy Wiederhorn. The indictment, filed in May 2024, included allegations of wire fraud and tax evasion related to a purported $47 million loan scheme. Wiederhorn, who had maintained his innocence, expressed relief and a focus on the company's growth. The dismissal follows a shakeup at the DOJ and comes after the prosecutor leading the case was fired, though a separate civil complaint from the SEC remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>Searches for adult summer camps have increased by nearly 350% this year, as reported by Yelp, reflecting a growing desire for community, nostalgia, and a break from daily life. These camps offer adults a chance to disconnect, participate in planned activities, and form new friendships in a simplified, communal environment. The trend is linked to rising levels of worker burnout and loneliness, with many attendees seeking to recapture the carefree experiences of youth. For an average cost of around $800 for a weekend, these camps provide a structured escape from modern pressures.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to buy Starbucks shares, expressing strong conviction in the company's turnaround under CEO Brian Niccol. Despite the stock giving up its post-earnings gains, Cramer sees the dip as a buying opportunity, drawing parallels to his confidence in Chipotle before its major stock surge. He highlighted that Starbucks' recovery plan appears to be effective, suggesting that the current market reaction is a misjudgment of the company's potential. Cramer's recommendation comes as the market processes Starbucks' latest financial results and future outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has published a letter detailing his vision for artificial intelligence, framing it as "personal superintelligence" focused on individual empowerment rather than simple automation. This comes as Meta invests billions to hire top AI talent, including establishing a new "Meta Superintelligence Labs" led by Scale AI's CEO. Zuckerberg's letter aims to provide clarity on the company's expensive AI strategy ahead of its earnings report. The vision distinguishes Meta's approach from competitors who, he suggests, are more focused on using AI to replace human labor, setting a distinct philosophical course for the technology's development.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Interest Rates Steady Amid Economic Resilience and Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 11:20:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting, despite intense pressure from President Trump to implement cuts. The decision is supported by recent data showing the U.S. economy grew at a resilient 3% annual rate in the second quarter, faster than anticipated. Officials are navigating a delicate balance, with Trump's tariffs contributing to inflation concerns while the president continues his public attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Fed's cautious stance reflects the economic instability created by trade policy and a desire to maintain its political independence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience by growing at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 2.3%. This growth marks a significant rebound from a 0.5% decline in the first quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by a sharp decrease in imports and a rise in consumer spending, a dynamic influenced by President Trump's tariff policies. The report also showed that a key inflation metric watched by the Federal Reserve remained near its target, providing context for the central bank's upcoming interest rate decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On its tenth anniversary, the Ethereum network's future is being viewed with renewed optimism, particularly due to growing institutional interest. This shift is partly driven by new U.S. crypto legislation on stablecoins, most of which operate on Ethereum, and a boom in corporate adoption. Despite a prolonged period of struggle where its native token, ETH, underperformed and faced stiff competition, analysts suggest it may be entering an "institutional arc" similar to Bitcoin's. The focus is shifting from speculative trends to the tokenization of real-world assets by major financial institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of declining same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, many Wall Street analysts are expressing optimism about Starbucks' ongoing turnaround. They point to "green shoots" such as improving customer traffic throughout the quarter, particularly among non-rewards members, which had been a declining cohort. CEO Brian Niccol's comments that the "Back to Starbucks" strategy is ahead of schedule, along with plans for new menu items and labor programs, have increased confidence. However, some investors remain cautious as the recovery is taking longer than initially anticipated.</p>
