          <h2>Analyst Doubts China Will Use Navy to Secure Hormuz Strait</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:45:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top US analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Richard Fontaine from the Center for a New American Security believes China would favor quiet negotiations and protecting its own interests over direct military intervention. He cited a past agreement between Beijing and Houthi rebels in the Red Sea, where Chinese-flagged vessels were spared from attacks. The analyst suggests that China's economic interests will continue to shape its approach in the region. Optimism regarding the geopolitical stability of the region is reflected in this analysis.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as national security, highlighting the strategy's potential to create jobs and growth. The strategy also focuses on enhancing the UK's competitiveness in science, education, trade, and technology. The government expects to reach 4.1% spending by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Iran's Limited Retaliation Could Lead to De-escalation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:38:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes the potential outcomes of recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Iran's subsequent response. It suggests that Iran's missile attack on a US base in Qatar, which resulted in no casualties, might signal a desire to de-escalate the conflict. President Trump's reaction, describing the Iranian response as "very weak," further supports this possibility. The article draws a parallel to the 2020 Soleimani killing, where a limited Iranian response led to a period of reduced tensions. The potential for peace and harmony in the region is dependent on the actions of both Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>Atl√©tico Madrid was eliminated from the Club World Cup despite a 1-0 victory over Botafogo, as they needed a win of at least three goals to advance.

Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi scored for PSG, while Gianluigi Donnarumma kept a clean sheet. Seattle's loss marked the elimination of their second MLS team from the competition.

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran.

President Donald Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," though a full battle damage assessment is still pending.
