          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, recognizing the increasingly challenging security environment. During a meeting with young SDF members in Kyoto Prefecture, Ishiba emphasized the importance of appropriately compensating them for their duties and the risks involved. This announcement follows the enactment of a revised law that includes new allowances for SDF members, addressing a serious shortage of recruits that Ishiba's cabinet has been aiming to tackle since last October. The move comes at a time when public trust in the SDF has been impacted by scandals, including sexual abuse cases, amidst government efforts to bolster the nation's defense capabilities in response to geopolitical tensions. </p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the first nationalized service departing from Woking to Surbiton. The government called the move a "new dawn for rail" but held back from promising lower fares, focusing more on plans to improve services and invest in infrastructure. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing staffing for security, cleaning and other areas to private companies. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that while she couldn't promise lower ticket prices, she would ensure customers receive good value for money, noting that taxpayers subsidize the trains by ¬£2 billion annually.</p>

          <p>The European Union is currently engaged in a trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles, raising questions about how to leverage Chinese investment in the sector. A debate is ongoing across Europe regarding whether China's expertise in the EV sector will create jobs or harm domestic industries. Windrose Technology, a Chinese company, recently announced plans to build a ‚Ç¨175 million factory in northern France, with ambitions to produce 4,000 electric lorries annually from 2027. Despite only having 30 trucks on the roads worldwide, Windrose aims to expand to the United States and pursue stock exchange listings in both countries.</p>

The Timberwolves' defense and offensive pressure proved too much for the Thunder, whose star player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander struggled, scoring only 14 points.

          <p>Following the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes in Nottinghamshire, a virologist from the University of Nottingham has urged the public to remain calm. Professor Jonathan Ball stated that climate change is likely to increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases, making it essential to be aware of the potential risks. He emphasizes that while the general public does not need to be overly concerned, mosquito surveillance projects will be conducted in areas like Gamston to monitor mosquito activity. Ball advises people to avoid mosquito bites by covering up and using insecticide, noting that the virus primarily affects birds and mosquitoes, with only a small percentage of human infections leading to severe illness.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star, is expected to return to pitching after the All-Star break, according to manager Dave Roberts. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. While he threw all his pitches, including a slider, in practice, the Dodgers are prioritizing his hitting and taking a gradual approach to his pitching rehab, making a pre-All-Star return unlikely.</p>
