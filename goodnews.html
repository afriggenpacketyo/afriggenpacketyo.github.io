          <p>More than 25 million people across the U.S. Northeast, from eastern Pennsylvania to southern Maine, are under alerts for severe weather and potential flash flooding. Major cities including Philadelphia and New York City are in the path of storms expected to bring damaging winds, large hail, and lightning. The National Weather Service has issued a Level 2 of 4 flash flood risk for a corridor from Philadelphia to Bridgeport, Connecticut, due to the potential for multiple rounds of heavy, training storms. The severe weather is forecast to begin Saturday afternoon and continue into the overnight hours before a cold front brings cooler, drier air to the region on Sunday.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Earwigs, an obscure power pop band from 1980s Orange County, is experiencing a revival after their rare 45 RPM single, "She’s So Naive," became a sought-after collector's item, fetching up to $500 online. Frontman Michael Ubaldini was initially unaware of the record's value, selling personal copies for just $20 before discovering their high price on resale markets. This renewed interest prompted the band to finally release their "lost" 1981 debut album on limited edition vinyl, which sold out two pressings in five days. The band is now playing a reunion show to celebrate their unlikely resurgence, driven by a cult following that kept their music alive for decades.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team ended their 2025 World Cup campaign with a whitewash after a narrow and entertaining loss to Fiji at Sandy Park in Exeter. Despite both teams being winless in Pool B, the match was played with high intensity, featuring end-to-end action. Wales initially took the lead, but Fiji's powerful and creative offense, led by player of the match Josifini Neihamu, secured them a deserved victory. Although Wales scored late to create a dramatic finish, they were unable to convert their final chances, leaving Fiji to celebrate a hard-fought win and Wales to begin an inquest into their tournament performance.</p>

His lap, averaging 164.484 mph, narrowly edged out McLaren's Lando Norris by just 0.077 seconds. The qualifying session was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Oscar Piastri finishing third, followed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. However, Hamilton will start 10th due to a five-place grid penalty, promoting Mercedes' George Russell to fifth for the start of the race. Verstappen's performance was a surprise given his struggles in practice sessions.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the location for his presidential library and has assembled a board to oversee the project. The 13-person governance board includes prominent figures such as former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and longtime adviser Steve Ricchetti, who will lead the significant fundraising effort. Although Biden has deep ties to his birthplace of Scranton, Pennsylvania, he ultimately selected Delaware, the state he represented in the Senate for 36 years. The project aims to create a lasting space for history and civic leadership, inspiring future generations, though it faces the challenge of raising substantial funds in a divided political climate.</p>

          <p>A new chapter of conservation is beginning at California's Point Reyes National seashore, where over 16,000 acres will be restored following a multi-million dollar buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations. The agreement, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, aims to heal landscapes impacted by decades of ranching by removing invasive plants and reintroducing native species. The five-year restoration plan will controversially use targeted cattle grazing as a tool to manage vegetation, alongside prescribed burns and mowing. While the transition is painful for the multi-generational ranching community, the project is seen as a vital experiment in creating climate-resilient ecosystems and could inform global conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump family is maturing its cryptocurrency operations, moving from flashy promotions like NFTs to more sober, seemingly legitimate business ventures. This week, American Bitcoin, a crypto-mining company co-founded by Eric Trump, began trading on the Nasdaq. Simultaneously, the family's firm, World Liberty Financial, which launched a stablecoin called USD1, unlocked a large tranche of governance tokens, reportedly creating billions in paper wealth for the family. These moves, which include another crypto firm listing on Nasdaq, provide a veneer of legitimacy to the Trumps' crypto empire, allowing them to capitalize on the brand while engaging in the volatile digital asset market.

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics and their allies participated in a historic Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant shift in their relationship with the Catholic Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a special Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Participants credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming environment, contrasting sharply with previous years when such groups felt shunned. The event, officially listed in the Vatican's Jubilee calendar, symbolizes a new era of hope and inclusion for LGBTQ+ individuals within the faith, a direction Pope Leo is expected to continue.</p>

          <p>As states across the U.S. implement rules limiting cellphone use in schools, many districts are turning to Yondr pouches, a lockable magnetic case, to enforce the bans. Students are required to place their phones in the pouches, which they carry throughout the day but can only be unlocked at magnetic stations at school entrances. The solution aims to reduce classroom distractions and help students engage more with their learning and each other.

The recent investigation of a high-profile figure from the stock market signals an expansion of Beijing's long-running drive beyond just the banking industry. While the crackdown may not provide an immediate boost to market sentiment amid current economic uncertainties, it aligns with the demands of international corporations and institutions for a more transparent and predictable business environment.

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have uncovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, one of the American Revolution's most brutal conflicts. The discovery in shallow, hastily dug graves has launched what experts are calling "the ultimate cold case." To identify the forgotten soldiers, who include American, British, and Native American fighters, researchers are employing forensic genealogy, building genetic profiles from the 240-year-old bones. The team has already generated profiles for two individuals and is asking the public, particularly those with family names like Warfield and Griffith from Maryland, to submit DNA to help restore the identities of these first American soldiers.</p>

This test follows a previous one in April 2023 that experienced technical issues, which the government says have since been addressed.

Other essential traits are sustained passion, reverence for their craft, and an unwavering commitment that requires sacrificing other options. The article suggests that Swift's career is a prime example of these principles in action, as she avoids dabbling in unimportant ventures and dedicates her energy to songwriting and performing, which have been her top priorities since her teenage years.</p>
