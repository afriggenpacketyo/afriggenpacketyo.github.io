          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. Through a $400 million investment, the Pentagon aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earths, which are critical for military technologies like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership is designed to reduce American dependence on China, which currently dominates the global market, and will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet manufacturing capabilities, backed by price guarantees.

          <p>Vietnam's government is implementing a significant tax hike on alcoholic beverages, with the rate set to increase from 65% to 90% by 2031. This move is part of a broader strategy to curb what officials see as harmful consumption habits and to improve public health, as alcohol is cited as the second-highest cause of death in the country. The increased tax revenue is also intended to support the nation's ambitious goals for universal health insurance coverage, especially as its population ages. The alcohol industry has voiced opposition, citing recent declines in sales and concerns about consumers turning to unregulated products.</p>

          <h2>Electric Vehicle Adoption Surges in Nepal Amid Favorable Government Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 09:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nepal is experiencing a rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, driven by government incentives and a public desire to combat severe air pollution in cities like Kathmandu. Favorable tax policies for EVs compared to gasoline-powered cars have made them an attractive alternative, with over 70% of new private vehicle imports now being electric. The government has set an ambitious target for 90% of new private vehicle sales to be electric by 2030. This transition is seen as a crucial step in reducing the nation's carbon footprint and leveraging its abundant clean hydropower resources for sustainable transportation.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump after reinstating its 2025 profit outlook and providing a stronger-than-expected forecast for summer travel. CEO Ed Bastian stated that while booking levels are lower than initially predicted at the start of the year, they have stabilized, prompting the airline to trim capacity outside of peak periods. The company reported strong growth from premium cabin sales and its American Express partnership, which helped offset a decline in main cabin revenue. While the full-year earnings forecast was lowered from January's optimistic prediction, the update provided a much-needed boost of confidence to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred within a seven-mile-long, 18-foot-wide wastewater outfall tunnel currently under construction as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's Clearwater Project. After being trapped for about an hour, the workers were able to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape, and fortunately, none sustained any visible injuries. The project has been placed on an indefinite hold pending a full investigation into the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear" by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive and innovative sound system from the early 1970s. The article reviews how the band, led by sound engineer Owsley "Bear" Stanley, attempted to create a perfect and egalitarian live audio experience by placing a colossal array of speakers directly behind them. While the concept was visionary, allowing for unparalleled clarity at great distances, it was also a logistical and technical nightmare. The complexity and expense of the system ultimately contributed to the band's temporary hiatus, illustrating the tension between artistic innovation and practical sustainability.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way for savers to protect their money's buying power, with top accounts currently yielding rates higher than inflation. The article notes a significant difference between national average CD rates and the higher rates offered by online banks, which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs (like 6-month or 1-year terms) presently offer better returns than long-term options. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare offerings from various online institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectionary giant Ferrero has announced its agreement to purchase cereal maker WK Kellogg in a deal valued at $3.1 billion, causing WK Kellogg's shares to soar. WK Kellogg, which produces iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes, was spun off from its parent company in 2023 as part of a strategy to focus on the more profitable snack business. The acquisition marks another step in Ferrero's expansion into the North American market, following other major purchases like Nestle's U.S. candy business. The deal reflects ongoing consolidation in a packaged foods industry facing shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options.</p>

The article explores the character's legacy as a trailblazer for Latino representation in media, which began in 2000 amid a political climate often hostile to bilingualism. Creators recall how they intentionally made the character a pan-Latina hero who used Spanish as a "superpower" to solve problems, empowering a generation of young viewers. The franchise's enduring appeal is highlighted by its expansion into new animated series and the influence it has had on a new generation of actors and creators.</p>

          <p>Economist Dean Spears, co-author of "After the Spike," makes the case that the world should be concerned about falling birth rates and a future of depopulation. He argues that a larger, or at least stable, population fosters greater progress, as more people contribute to the collective knowledge and innovation that improves life for everyone. The article explains that Spears rejects both alarmism and the conservative argument for a return to traditional gender roles as a solution. Instead, he advocates for a careful, long-term conversation about creating a society that better supports parenting for all, making it easier for people to choose to have children.</p>
