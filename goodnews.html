          <p>Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations, and announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program to be completed over the next three months. This marks the 14th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks, demonstrating Shell's commitment to increasing shareholder returns, despite a 28% decrease in earnings compared to the same period last year. CEO Wael Sawan highlighted the company's strong performance and resilient balance sheet, reaffirming the reduced annual investment budget of $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025. The announcement comes as Big Oil faces scrutiny over shareholder returns amidst falling profits from record highs in 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. employers added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing economist forecasts, despite ongoing economic uncertainty caused by the Trump administration's trade policies.

This data arrives after a recent report indicated a contraction in the U.S. economy during the first three months of 2025, attributed to the uncertainty generated by President Trump's tariff proposals, however the labor market continues to be a bright spot amid consumer concerns.</p>

          <p>The U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, a solid figure despite a slowdown from the previous month, even with President Trump's tariff announcement early last month. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, a historically low figure, and inflation cooled in March. Despite market volatility and flagging consumer sentiment, the labor market has remained a bright spot since Trump took office, with an average of 170,000 jobs added monthly this year.

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, primarily due to volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, which offset lower earnings from weak oil prices. Profits declined 6% to $7.71 billion, or $1.76 per share, from $8.22 billion in the same quarter last year, while revenue came in at $83.13 billion. CEO Darren Woods described the market as "choppy," noting that higher supply depressed prices despite strong demand, and the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders in the quarter.

Although the discussions were "very positive and constructive," disparities persist between the two nations, necessitating "maximum efforts" from both sides to reach an agreement. Japan seeks to be excluded from increased tariffs on imports of vehicles, iron, steel, and aluminum, while the U.S. is pushing for greater access to Japan's auto and agricultural sectors.</p>
