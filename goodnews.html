          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the semi-finals of the World Cup after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India in Indore. England set a target of 289, anchored by a masterful century from former captain Heather Knight. India appeared poised for victory at 234-3, but the dismissal of opener Smriti Mandhana for 88 triggered a middle-order collapse under pressure. Despite a late effort from Deepti Sharma, India fell just short, finishing on 284-6, in a dramatic turn of events that keeps their own semi-final hopes uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A World Health Organization report indicates a significant drop in smoking prevalence in Southeast Asia over the past two decades, attributed to strong public health policies like higher taxes and advertising bans. However, population growth means the absolute number of smokers has increased, and the fight against tobacco is far from over. Indonesia, a major outlier with high smoking rates, recently scrapped a planned tax hike, highlighting the potent influence of the tobacco industry on government policy. Furthermore, the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, particularly among adolescents, presents a new public health challenge for the entire region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student loan forgiveness for borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans. This decision follows a lawsuit filed by the American Federation of Teachers, which accused the administration of unlawfully blocking access to these congressionally mandated programs. The administration had previously paused forgiveness under these plans, citing a court order related to a separate Biden-era program, a move that consumer advocates argued was an overly broad interpretation. The agreement is a significant victory for millions of borrowers enrolled in these plans who are working towards debt cancellation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter, known for playing on both offense and defense, recorded his first career touchdown in a game against the Los Angeles Rams. The No. 2 overall draft pick caught a 34-yard pass from quarterback Trevor Lawrence in the fourth quarter. Despite the personal milestone, the Jaguars were already facing a significant deficit and ultimately could not overcome the Rams' dominant performance. Hunter, who has been primarily utilized on offense to provide an offensive spark, was a bright spot for the team, leading in receptions during the game.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT on household energy bills ahead of the November Budget. Acknowledging the severe cost-of-living crisis, Miliband stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues" to provide relief, though he stopped short of confirming any specific policy. Such a move would save the average household approximately £86 per year but would come at a significant fiscal cost. Miliband emphasized that the long-term solution to high bills is transitioning to home-grown clean energy, reducing dependency on volatile fossil fuel markets. (not investment advice)</p>

Power, the top-performing airports excel in fundamental areas such as cleanliness and TSA efficiency. The ongoing government shutdown has not yet had a significant impact on these satisfaction rankings, though travelers are advised to be prepared for potential delays as the situation continues.</p>

          <p>Thousands of sheep and goats paraded through the streets of Madrid for the annual Transhumance Festival, a tradition that celebrates the ancient practice of moving livestock between seasonal pastures. The event, which draws large crowds of locals and tourists, also serves to highlight the environmental benefits of traditional grazing for preventing wildfires by clearing flammable undergrowth. Organizers paid a symbolic fee in medieval coins to city officials for the animals' passage, upholding an agreement dating back to 1418. The festival honors Spain's rural heritage and underscores the ecological importance of these long-standing agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Following more than a week of deadly fighting, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, mediated by Qatar and Turkey. The clashes, the most severe since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, were fueled by Islamabad's accusations that the Taliban harbors militant groups that attack Pakistan. The new agreement includes a commitment from the Taliban not to support these groups and for both sides to refrain from targeting security forces and civilians. This ceasefire is seen as a crucial first step toward de-escalating tensions, with further talks planned to establish lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The Yangwang U9 Xtreme, an all-electric hypercar from Chinese automaker BYD, has shattered the speed record for a production car, reaching 308.4 miles per hour. This achievement dethrones the gas-powered Bugatti Chiron Sport 300+, which held the previous record. The driver credited the unique capabilities of electric motors, such as quiet operation and lack of load changes, for allowing superior focus and control at extreme speeds. The record serves as a powerful demonstration that electric vehicles can not only match but also exceed the performance benchmarks traditionally set by internal combustion engine supercars.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a strategy to train and recruit more workers for its clean energy sector, with a pledge to create 400,000 additional jobs by 2030. The plan identifies 31 priority occupations, including plumbers and electricians, as demand in renewable energy fields is expected to double. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match military veterans and others with careers in solar, wind, and nuclear energy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated that this initiative will bring well-paid, secure jobs to industrial communities and help lower energy bills long-term.</p>

          <p>An opinion article commends two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's rationale for the deployments, which described the cities as "war-ravaged" and under siege, was "untethered to the facts." The author praises the judges for having the courage to speak truth to power and resist the president's efforts to normalize military intrusion into civil affairs. The article contrasts their actions with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to the executive, urging the higher court to be more critical of the administration's claims.</p>
