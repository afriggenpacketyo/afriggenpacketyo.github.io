          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have secured their first World Series appearance since 1993 after defeating the Seattle Mariners 4-3 in a dramatic Game 7 of the American League Championship Series. George Springer hit a go-ahead, three-run home run in the seventh inning to overcome a multi-run deficit, a historic first for a Game 7. The Blue Jays will now face the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers, who are aiming to be the first team to win back-to-back titles in a quarter-century. Toronto will host the series opener due to a better regular season record.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to its sixth consecutive record high, driven by investor optimism over an impending trade deal with the United States. This positive sentiment rippled across the Asia-Pacific region, with Japan's Nikkei 225 also hitting a new all-time high. The rally was further supported by a critical minerals agreement between the U.S. and Australia, which caused a significant jump in the shares of Australian rare earth mining companies. These market gains reflect growing confidence in regional economic stability and international trade partnerships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The WWE World Heavyweight Championship has been officially vacated following an announcement that champion Seth Rollins sustained an injury during an event in Australia. The injury was exacerbated by an on-screen attack from fellow wrestlers Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed on "Monday Night Raw." In response, a battle royal was held to determine a new contender for the vacant title. Jey Uso emerged as the winner and is now scheduled to face CM Punk for the championship at the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event.</p>

          <p>A new documentary titled "Spacewoman" is shedding light on the historic career of Eileen Collins, who broke barriers as the first woman to both pilot and command a NASA Space Shuttle. Collins was a crucial figure in the shuttle program, known for her determination and skill, especially when she commanded the "return to flight" mission after the tragic 2003 Columbia disaster. In that mission, she successfully executed a risky, unprecedented 360-degree flip maneuver in orbit to allow for a damage assessment of the shuttle's heat shield. The film chronicles her journey from a young girl inspired by the Gemini astronauts to a pioneering leader in space exploration.</p>

          <p>An American Airlines regional flight from Omaha to Los Angeles made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff due to a critical communication failure. The pilots were unable to contact the flight attendants via the inter-phone system and became concerned when they heard knocking on the cockpit door. After landing safely back in Omaha, it was determined that the knocking was from the flight crew attempting to communicate, and there was no security threat. The incident was caused by a problem with the aircraft's internal communication system, and passengers were rebooked on another flight.</p>

          <p>The University of Arizona has become the seventh U.S. university to formally reject a "Compact for Academic Excellence" proposed by the Trump administration. The compact would offer priority for federal funding to universities that agree to implement a conservative-leaning agenda, including changes to admissions practices, hiring, and definitions of gender. In his rejection letter, the university's president emphasized that core principles like academic freedom and merit-based research funding must be preserved. Six other institutions, including MIT and Brown University, have also declined to sign the proposal, citing similar concerns over institutional independence.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police's new lead on phone theft has admitted that the force's past efforts to tackle the crime have not been "good enough," as conviction rates remain extremely low. With phone thefts in London on the rise, the force is implementing a revised strategy that treats the issue with greater seriousness, now targeting the organized crime groups behind the thefts. This new approach involves using resources from the serious crime directorate, which typically handles major offenses like firearms and drug importation. A recent operation led to 18 arrests and the seizure of 2,000 stolen handsets, disrupting a network believed to be responsible for 40% of London's phone thefts.</p>

"Pillar two" focuses on collaboration in advanced military technologies like artificial intelligence, hypersonic missiles, and undersea robotics. Recently, the pact came under review by the Trump administration to ensure alignment with its "America First" policy, but President Trump has since stated the deal is proceeding "full steam ahead."</p>

With an estimated 2,000 golf carts in the town of 8,000 residents, officials have implemented safety measures to prevent accidents with regular vehicle traffic. The new rules restrict golf carts to streets with a speed limit of 25 mph or less and require them to pass inspections for working signals and horns. Additionally, drivers must now be at least 18 years old and possess a valid driver's license to operate a golf cart on city streets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found a dramatic 43% drop in peanut allergy rates among young children, a change attributed to updated medical advice recommending the early introduction of peanuts to infants. This research validates a landmark 2015 study that reversed decades of guidance, showing that feeding peanut products to babies, especially those at high risk, significantly reduces their chances of developing an allergy. The study, which analyzed health records from over 120,000 children, provides real-world evidence that the new guidelines are effectively preventing tens of thousands of allergy diagnoses. This success highlights the importance of public health policy in managing food allergies.</p>

          <p>The recent "No Kings" protests across the United States have demonstrated the significant and geographically widespread opposition to the Trump administration, with participation estimates reaching over 4 million people. According to this article, these demonstrations serve as a crucial antidote to political despair, uniting a broad coalition of opponents under a simple, constitutionally-focused slogan. While not expected to produce immediate policy changes, the protests signal to wavering political and corporate allies that aligning with the administration carries risks. The sustained energy of this mass movement could translate into concrete electoral outcomes in future elections, challenging the narrative of the administration's invincibility.</p>
