          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a controlling interest in the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the owner of the L.A. Dodgers, for an estimated $10 billion. Jeanie Buss will retain the title of governor, continuing to represent the team in league matters. This sale shatters the previous record for a sports team sale, making the Lakers the most valuable sports franchise in the world. Walter's ownership could usher in a new era for the Lakers, given his track record of high-dollar deals and success with the Dodgers, and this is a significant moment for the franchise.</p>

The circus survived near closure in 2009 and now performs at a big top in Ansan, drawing both older and younger generations. The circus now focuses on acrobatic performances, with all 35 acrobats being Chinese due to a lack of South Korean applicants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reduce duty liabilities amid tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. This involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions of products to fit into lower-tariff categories. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist for certain products, allowing companies to benefit through strategic design choices. Examples include bundling steel and aluminum elements, switching to cotton, and adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to change their tariff classification. (not investment advice)</p>
