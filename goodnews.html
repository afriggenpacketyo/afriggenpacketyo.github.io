          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the United States, with its share of U.S. imports jumping to 44% in the second quarter, a significant rise from 13% the previous year. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. While overall iPhone shipments have declined, major manufacturers like Apple, Samsung, and Motorola are increasingly assembling U.S.-bound devices in India, reflecting a broader trend of diversifying production away from Beijing.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump clarified that he is not currently seeking a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping but would consider visiting China if an invitation, which he says has been extended, is formally acted upon. This statement comes amid ongoing discussions between aides from both nations about a potential face-to-face meeting later this year, possibly around the APEC summit in South Korea. Such a meeting would be their first in Trump's second term, occurring as trade and security tensions between the two global powers persist.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in his first call with South Korea's new foreign policy chief Cho Hyun, encouraged Seoul to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling" from China. Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable China policy to foster pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call signals Beijing's effort to reset relations with South Korea's new administration under President Lee Jae-myung, who is generally viewed as more open to dialogue with China than his predecessor.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its falling birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The new policy offers families 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move expected to assist around 20 million families. This comes as China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, and the country remains one of the world's most expensive places to raise children, prompting various local governments to also pilot financial incentives.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed new orders for 300,000 of its H20 AI chipsets with manufacturer TSMC, driven by robust demand from China. This move follows the Trump administration's decision to allow sales of the specialized H20 chip to resume after a temporary ban, a reversal aimed at easing trade tensions. The H20 was developed specifically for the Chinese market to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions, and the new orders suggest Nvidia is committed to supplying Chinese tech giants despite the complex geopolitical landscape surrounding advanced AI technology.

While the Taiwanese Presidential Office cited the need to focus on domestic typhoon relief efforts, the decision is seen as a move that could ease the path for a potential meeting between U.S. President Trump and Chinese President Xi. Beijing, which views Taiwan as a breakaway province, consistently opposes official interactions between Taiwanese leaders and other world governments, making such transits a sensitive diplomatic issue.</p>

Downing Street sees the access as crucial for strengthening the UK-US relationship and aligning on global issues, hoping the president's recent comments on Gaza signal a toughening stance that could support a new European-led peace initiative.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's lackluster response to the Trump administration's new trade agreement with the European Union is due to "tariff ennui" and a greater focus on other major economic events. He argues that investors are preoccupied with this week's Big Tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. Cramer suggests that until these key events pass, Wall Street will largely ignore trade policy news, viewing the negotiations as a familiar pattern that is unlikely to significantly move markets at this time.
