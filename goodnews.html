          <p>Starbucks reported its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, yet its stock rose as CEO Brian Niccol asserted that the company's turnaround is progressing ahead of schedule.

The company is focusing on improving customer service through its "Green Apron Service" program and making cafes more comfortable, while also seeing positive signs in its China market after price adjustments.

          <p>Gap's Athleta brand has appointed Maggie Gauger, the head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new CEO, a significant move for both athleisure companies. The decision is a strategic win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales and is on its third CEO in two years, as it seeks to reinvigorate its brand. For Nike, the departure represents a considerable loss, as the company has been focusing on growing its women's category as a central part of its turnaround strategy under CEO Elliott Hill.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Authority has settled a lawsuit with the advocacy group Jobs to Move America, allowing its $730-million contract with Hyundai Rotem to proceed. The agreement ensures the project to build new subway cars for the 2028 Olympics will include provisions for fair worker pay and the hiring of disadvantaged workers, which were allegedly missing from the original contract. Metro will pay $250,000 in legal fees and hire a consultant to improve future procurement strategies. This resolution allows the transit agency to move forward with updating its aging fleet without impacting the delivery timeline for the new cars.</p>

          <p>The new film "Together," starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, is reviewed as a unique blend of body horror and relationship therapy. The plot centers on an unhappy couple who move to a remote forest and discover a mysterious pool of water that causes a biological urge to physically merge with each other. The review praises the film's clever metaphor for codependence, drawing parallels to Plato's "Symposium" and John Carpenter's "The Thing." Director Michael Shanks is commended for his expert misdirection and for fusing gross-out visuals with empathetic performances, creating a film that is simultaneously tragic, darkly humorous, and squirm-inducing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revived his long-standing ambition to construct a large ballroom on the White House grounds, a project he has discussed for at least 15 years. Trump argues that the current event spaces, like the East Room, are too small for large state dinners, forcing the use of outdoor tents, which he dislikes. He claims his experience as a real estate developer uniquely qualifies him to oversee the construction of a grand, permanent structure capable of holding a thousand people. While the White House confirms discussions are ongoing, critics worry about the aesthetic impact on the iconic property.</p>
