        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he prefers only one rate cut this year due to concerns about upward pressures on inflation, partially driven by tariffs. He noted that consumer sentiment surveys show Americans are worried about the potential of tariffs to push inflation higher. Bostic emphasized his concern about inflation expectations moving in a troublesome way, which would make the Fed's job harder. While the Fed projected two quarter-point rate cuts in March, Bostic believes it will take longer for the situation to sort out. </p>

          <p>Presidential elections in Romania and Poland saw the political center, though weakened, hold off hard-right breakthroughs. In Romania, a centrist mayor, Nicusor Dan, defeated a hard-line nationalist aligned with Trump, confounding expectations of a sharp turn to the right. In Poland, a hard-right candidate will advance to a runoff, but the liberal candidate still came in first. Both elections point to growing discontent with established political parties, which is likely to generate future turbulence as old loyalties fade.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union have struck a deal to boost security cooperation and remove some trade barriers introduced by Brexit, according to a New York Times article. The agreement is intended to help the two sides work more closely together amid signals that the United States is reducing its commitment to European security. The deal includes easier border crossings, simplified travel with pets, and the resumption of some British meat product sales in the EU. The agreement also involves extending European trawlers' access to British waters until 2038, a politically contentious issue. </p>

          <p>A theoretical proposal published in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics is challenging our previous understanding of quantum physics. The proposal suggests scrapping almost everything we think we know about gravity, as Live Science explains. Instead, the authors touch up the theory to match known and observable physics, something they call unified gravity. This new model is an attempt to skip all that. It offers physicists a bold new trail to blaze in the long-running search to unite quantum physics with the theory of gravity.</p>
