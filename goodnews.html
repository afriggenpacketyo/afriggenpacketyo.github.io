          <p>Elon Musk attempted to disrupt a major artificial intelligence infrastructure deal in the Middle East after learning that his startup, xAI, was excluded from the initiative involving OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Cisco, and Emirati firm G42. Musk reportedly argued that President Donald Trump would disapprove of the deal and intervened to involve xAI, delaying the announcement. The White House acknowledged the AI partnership between the U.S. and the UAE but did not comment on Musk's involvement. Musk has been a vocal critic of OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, suing the company for breach of contract and unsuccessfully bidding to buy control of the startup. The context of this article involves the ongoing competition between Musk and Altman in the AI sector, impacting Trump's efforts to solidify U.S. leadership in AI.</p>

          <p>Despite claims from the Department of Defense that the United States has accepted a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar, the details of the agreement are still being reviewed by legal teams.

The aircraft is expected to be used by Trump as the new Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office, after which ownership will transfer to the Trump presidential library foundation. Intelligence experts and lawmakers have raised security concerns about accepting the jet from a foreign nation, but Trump considers it a "very nice gesture."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Non-alcoholic beer is projected to overtake ale as the second-largest beer category worldwide by volume this year, according to industry tracker IWSR. While overall beer volume decreased by roughly 1% in 2024, the volume of non-alcoholic beer grew by 9% worldwide. This growth is attributed to more consumers reducing their alcohol consumption, particularly among younger generations who use terms like "sober curious" and "damp lifestyle." Major beer brands have invested in zero-proof alternatives that mimic the taste of alcoholic versions, contributing to the trend.</p>
