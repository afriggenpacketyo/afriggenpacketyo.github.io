          <p>Liu, a former commander of the Chinese navy, is celebrated as a visionary technocrat who spearheaded the comprehensive modernization of China’s naval forces to world-class standards. His strategic genius has drawn comparisons to 19th-century US naval officer Alfred Thayer Mahan. Joining the Red Army at 13 and participating in the Long March, Liu rose through the People's Liberation Army ranks before his transfer to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952. Despite first seeing the sea at that time, his long and distinguished career profoundly shaped China's "blue sea strategy," transforming its capabilities and leaving an enduring legacy in national defense.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 19:42:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has seen a significant 25% reduction in fatal drug overdoses in 2024, translating to nearly 30,000 lives saved, with North Carolina at the forefront of this positive trend. This turnaround is largely attributed to comprehensive harm reduction strategies, including law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs and expanded access to opioid use disorder medications like methadone and buprenorphine. The widespread availability and administration of naloxone, an overdose reversal drug, also played a crucial role. Despite this progress, challenges persist in certain demographics and states, and potential federal funding cuts could impact future efforts.</p>

          <p>Muhammad Pahlawan, a Pakistani national, has been sentenced to 40 years in a US prison for smuggling ballistic missile parts from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen using a fishing boat. Pahlawan was apprehended during a US military operation in the Arabian Sea in January 2024, an incident that tragically resulted in the drowning of two US Navy Seals. His crew later testified they were deceived, believing they were working as fishermen.

          <p>A new study reveals promising results for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, with three-quarters lacking existing screening programs. Trial data from North America showed the test identified more than half of cancers at an early, more treatable stage, and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. The test works by detecting cancerous DNA fragments in the blood and accurately identified the cancer's origin in 9 out of 10 cases. Further research, including a large NHS trial, is underway to confirm if this innovation translates into reduced cancer mortality.</p>
