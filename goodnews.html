Norris took responsibility for the incident, which occurred on lap 67 as he attempted an overtake on Piastri. The collision is reminiscent of a similar incident between McLaren drivers in 2011. While the incident is a setback for Norris' championship aspirations, it's not a fatal blow with many races remaining.</p>

The protests were organized by progressive groups to oppose Trump's administration and policies.  The protests were intentionally held outside of Washington D.C. to avoid potential conflict with the military parade.  Some events were cancelled due to the ongoing manhunt for the Minnesota lawmaker shooting suspect.</p>

          <p>President Trump's highly anticipated military parade was less of a spectacle and more of a historical presentation of the US Army.  The event, celebrating the Army's 250th anniversary, showcased the Army's history from its revolutionary beginnings to modern technology.  The article contrasts the parade's tone with previous concerns about the potential for political exploitation of the military.  The article also reflects on the anxieties surrounding the event and the contrasting images of military presence in Washington D.C. versus Los Angeles.</p>
