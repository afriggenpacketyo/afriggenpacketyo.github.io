        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ron Howard's new film, "Eden," reviewed as a lurid and sweaty thriller, dramatizes the true story of 1930s European idealists who establish a remote settlement in the Galapagos. The film, starring Jude Law, Sydney Sweeney, and Ana de Armas, depicts their utopian experiment devolving into power struggles, jealousy, and murder. While the article suggests the movie prioritizes melodramatic, beach-read pacing over deep philosophical insight, it praises the strong ensemble cast for their committed performances. The review characterizes it as an entertaining, if not profound, look at humanity's darker instincts in isolation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has broadened an injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement. The ruling, which previously applied to a handful of cities, now protects dozens more, including major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles and Chicago. The cities argued that the administration's policy to punish them is an unconstitutional abuse of power that infringes on states' rights. The decision represents a significant legal setback for the White House's efforts to compel local law enforcement to assist with federal immigration crackdowns.</p>

          <p>The new film "Relay" is reviewed as a smart and tense thriller featuring Riz Ahmed as Ash, a secretive fixer who helps whistleblowers disappear using untraceable communication methods. The plot intensifies when he takes on a new client, a biotech scientist played by Lily James, who is on the run from a ruthless corporate surveillance team. The article praises the film for its clever premise and clockwork pacing, creating a compelling cat-and-mouse chase through New York City. Ahmed's performance is highlighted for conveying the character's loneliness and questioning his own mission, adding depth to the suspense.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Virginia is playing a crucial role in the global effort to save wildlife from extinction. The facility houses and studies over 20 endangered species, including the Przewalski's horse and the black-footed ferret, with the goal of breeding them and reintroducing them into their natural habitats. Scientists at the institute warn that species are disappearing at an alarming rate, which can cause cascading negative effects on entire ecosystems. Their work, such as preparing ferret kits for release into the wild, represents a hopeful and proactive approach to conservation.</p>

          <p>Russia's waning influence in the post-Soviet space is becoming more apparent as countries forge new alliances, exemplified by a recent US-brokered peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The war in Ukraine has provided a "window of opportunity" for nations like Azerbaijan to assert greater independence and strengthen ties with Turkey and Central Asian states. Strained relations between Russia and Azerbaijan have also contributed to this shift. This trend reflects a broader realignment in the region, with countries developing multi-vector foreign policies and China quietly increasing its influence.</p>

          <p>The UK is expected to experience a late-summer heatwave, with temperatures forecast to reach 30°C (86°F) on the upcoming bank holiday Monday. This warm spell, driven by the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the country, comes during what is already on track to be one of the hottest summers on record. While many will enjoy the sunny conditions for events like the Notting Hill Carnival, the heat follows a season of drought and wildfires. The warmth will be short-lived, with more unsettled and cooler weather predicted to arrive by Tuesday.</p>

          <p>After a prolonged legal battle, a central Berlin street formerly known by a racist term for Black people has been officially renamed Anton-Wilhelm-Amo-Strasse. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century, Ghana-born scholar who became the first person of African descent to earn a European doctorate. Civil society groups have campaigned for this change for decades, arguing the original name was a painful reminder of slavery and colonial violence. The renaming, finalized on the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade, is considered a significant step in Germany's efforts to decolonize its public spaces.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has erupted again, sending fountains of lava 100 feet into the air within its summit crater on Hawaii's Big Island. This marks the 31st such episode since the current eruption period began in December, with the activity contained and posing no threat to homes. The frequent and spectacular displays are drawing increased tourism to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where visitors can witness the event from safe distances. Scientists are continuously monitoring the volcano, which tradition says is the home of the volcano goddess Pele, to predict its behavior.</p>
