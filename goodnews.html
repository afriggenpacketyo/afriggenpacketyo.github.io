          <p>Lazzat, ridden by James Doyle, triumphed over Satono Reve at Royal Ascot, preventing a Japanese victory. The win marked a double for Doyle and Wathnan Racing, who also celebrated Humidity's earlier success. Rebel's Romance, trained by Charlie Appleby, claimed the Hardwicke Stakes, Appleby's first Royal Ascot win since 2022, with William Buick as the jockey. This Group One victory added to Rebel's Romance's impressive record, providing a much-needed win for Appleby after Treanmor's earlier defeat. The jockey was briefly unseated after the finish line when the horse ran loose before being caught.</p>

          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a Belarusian opposition leader jailed in 2020, has been released from prison after being pardoned. Tsikhanouski was incarcerated by Alexander Lukashenko's regime after challenging him in an election. His wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in his place, thanked the US for its efforts in securing his release. Tsikhanouski's release coincided with a visit by US Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk for talks with Lukashenko to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lions legend Ian McLauchlan has died at the age of 83.

He was one of only five players to start all eight Test matches on those tours, scoring a crucial try in 1971.

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches the U.S., experts say American sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries. While US sunscreens protect against UVB rays, they often provide weaker protection against UVA rays due to regulatory differences. The FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years, while countries like France and Japan have approved a wider range of ingredients. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and advise using broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>A photo project by Miora Rajaonary raises awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a disease affecting millions of women and girls in Africa. The portraits feature women wearing traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their bravery in speaking out about the disease. The women work in rice fields, exposing them to contaminated water and the parasitic worms that cause FGS. The project, supported by the End Fund, aims to break taboos and emphasize the need for clean water and health care.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. Civil liberties groups hailed the ruling as a victory for the separation of church and state, arguing that the law would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>This article argues for the importance of air conditioning, despite its environmental impact. Air conditioning saves lives during heat waves, keeps people productive at work and school, and improves sleep quality. It has also enabled the development of various industries, from movie theaters to microchip manufacturing, and allows people to live and travel in hot climates. While air conditioning contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, the article suggests focusing on improving its efficiency and using cleaner energy sources.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a heart failure patient with an LVAD, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels. The procedure, performed at the Mayo Clinic, involved transplanting a heart and liver from the same donor, and donating Baker's healthy liver to another patient. Despite a long recovery and the subsequent death of her husband, Baker hopes her experience will pave the way for more patients to receive lifesaving treatment. Another surgery like Baker's was already conducted, and that another is in the works.</p>
