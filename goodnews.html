          <p>China is reportedly developing a space defense system to protect its Tiangong space station from potentially interfering spacecraft. According to scientist Sun Zhibin, the system would involve deploying small robotic thrusters to latch onto and redirect suspicious objects approaching the space station. This development follows China's report to the United Nations that Tiangong had to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid collisions with SpaceX's Starlink satellites in 2021. The report says Starlink satellites were descending from their usual orbits and entering Tiangong‚Äôs operational zone, prompting emergency avoidance actions.</p>
