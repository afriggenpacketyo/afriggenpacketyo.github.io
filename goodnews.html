          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is seeking government approval to allow domestic banks to lend rupees to overseas borrowers, a move aimed at promoting the internationalization of the Indian currency. The proposal suggests initiating rupee-denominated lending in neighboring countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, with potential expansion to global cross-border transactions. The RBI aims to reduce reliance on government-backed credit lines and currency swap arrangements by enabling commercial banks to provide rupee liquidity on market terms. The initiative is expected to facilitate trade settlements in rupees and mitigate exposure to foreign exchange volatility (not investment advice).</p>

The YU7 boasts a claimed driving range exceeding 760 kilometers on a single charge, surpassing the advertised range of the Tesla Model Y. Analysts predict that the YU7 will significantly erode Tesla's market share in China due to its competitive pricing and extended range.

          <p>Japan has begun selling government rice stockpiles through direct contracts, aiming to reduce soaring rice prices to approximately 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The government is releasing around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. This move seeks to address public concerns about rising rice prices amid broader inflation, which is outpacing wage growth. The agriculture ministry has established a special response team to tackle the high rice price issue and prevent consumer disengagement with rice products.</p>

          <p>Businesses are utilizing a decades-old legal provision known as the "first sale rule" to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the initial sale price in a series of transactions, effectively stripping out the costs associated with intermediary profits. While the first sale rule has been around since 1988, it is gaining renewed attention amid recent tariff regimes. The application of the rule requires fulfilling specific criteria, including multiple sales, arm's-length transactions, proof of U.S. destination, and documentation of the first sale price.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep helps the brain clean up harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, reveals that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to ‚Äúrepair mode,‚Äù prompting restorative slumber. The findings offer insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.</p>
