          <p>Former LSU head coach Ed Orgeron has made a bold comparison, stating that Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning is as talented as, or even better than, former LSU star Joe Burrow. Orgeron observed Manning during a Texas practice and expressed his strong impression ahead of the Longhorns' first game of 2025 against top-ranked Ohio State. Manning, who has only played in two college games, downplayed the praise, emphasizing the need to prove himself on the field.

          <p>Rudi Gernreich, an Austrian-born designer, invented the thong in 1974 as a political statement against Los Angeles' nudity ban, aiming to liberate the body rather than sexualize it. A pioneer of body positivity and LGBTQ+ rights, Gernreich also introduced the monokini in 1964, challenging societal taboos around female nudity. His designs consistently explored unisex fashion and celebrated the moving body, reflecting his early experiences studying anatomy. The article highlights Gernreich's enduring legacy as a visionary who championed individual freedom and challenged conventional norms in fashion.</p>

          <p>The UK government has reportedly ceased its demand for Apple to provide "backdoor" access to encrypted U.S. customer data, according to Donald Trump's spy chief, Tulsi Gabbard. This development follows a months-long transatlantic dispute, where the UK had issued a "technical capability notice" under the Investigatory Powers Act, leading Apple to withdraw advanced data protection options for new British customers. The alleged agreement, though unconfirmed by the Home Office or Apple, aims to protect American citizens' privacy and civil liberties, while the UK emphasizes ongoing joint security arrangements for serious crime.</p>
