          <p>This Fox News article explores the concept of a seven-day week, arguing that its origins lie in the Bible, specifically the commandment to work for six days and rest on the seventh. It delves into the historical context, noting how ancient cultures had varying week lengths and how the Soviets attempted to eliminate the seven-day week. The article contrasts the 20th-century view of work as a financial necessity with the modern obsession with busyness, ultimately concluding that a balanced life of meaningful work and sacred rest is the key to productivity and happiness. The article cites studies showing a productivity ceiling of 55 hours a week and suggests that the biblical model aligns with this research, promoting a life that is neither all leisure nor all work.

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the base of a sixth-century Byzantine bucket at Sutton Hoo, England, containing cremated animal and human remains. The Bromeswell bucket, depicting a North African hunting scene, has puzzled researchers since its fragments were unearthed in 1986. The new excavations revealed the bucket's entire base, along with a comb and cremated remains, shedding light on its purpose as a burial vessel. Researchers believe the bucket, likely a diplomatic gift or acquired by a Saxon soldier, was used to contain the remains of a high-status individual in the Sutton Hoo community.</p>

The department faces an officer shortage, straining resources, but O'Hara is focused on "getting back to the basics" and restoring pride in the profession.
