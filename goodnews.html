          <p>A new pilot program in Kent primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to address the rising incidence of melanoma skin cancer. The initiative, which includes lessons on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen, is slated for a nationwide rollout in 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma later in life, and educating children early is a key preventative measure. The program aims to empower the next generation with the knowledge to protect their skin, as diagnoses of this serious cancer are projected to increase.</p>

Having achieved a 98% success rate over its career, the H2A series has been a cornerstone of Japan's space exploration efforts.

          <p>Dozens of Smokey Bones restaurant locations are set to be rebranded into Twin Peaks, a sports bar chain known for its American-style food and atmosphere similar to Hooters. The acquisition by Fat Brands has left many employees in the dark about which specific restaurants will be converted and when the changes will occur. An employee at one location noted that after an initial brief visit from corporate representatives over six months ago, there has been no further communication. Twin Peaks has ambitious expansion plans, aiming to grow from its current 109 locations to over 650 in the future.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The march proceeded despite an official ban, which was based on a controversial law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, championed the event, framing it as a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The large turnout, significantly higher than in previous years, was seen by many participants as a direct response to the government's attempt to suppress the gathering.</p>

Ohtani's performance was a significant positive as he continues his recovery from Tommy John surgery, demonstrating powerful velocity and effective off-speed pitches.

While the U.S. maintains a significant lead in AI chip technology, a gap that may take years to close, Chinese firms are making notable progress in algorithmic efficiency. Shum highlighted the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which has achieved performance comparable to top U.S. models using a fraction of the AI chips.
