          <p>Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman has been discharged from the intensive care unit and moved to a rehabilitation facility following a shooting at his home three weeks ago. Hoffman was shot nine times, and his wife, Yvette, was shot eight times in what authorities have described as a politically motivated attack. The alleged shooter, who is also accused of killing state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband on the same night, is in custody facing federal and state charges. Yvette Hoffman was released from the hospital in June, marking a positive step in the family's recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screening at many major U.S. airports. The rule change, which began rolling out in early July, will eventually apply to all standard security lanes nationwide, aligning them with the existing TSA PreCheck policy. The shoe removal requirement was first implemented in 2006, years after Richard Reid's failed attempt to detonate explosives hidden in his footwear on a flight. Passengers who trigger alarms at scanners will still be required to remove their shoes for additional screening.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing to pursue higher education in Singapore over the United States, citing cultural adjustments and safety concerns in America. Industry insiders note that while the U.S. has been the traditional top choice, Singapore's high-quality universities, cultural familiarity, and perceived stability are making it an increasingly attractive alternative. One Chinese student currently in the U.S. explained her decision to apply to Singaporean universities for her master's degree, pointing to the nation's welcoming environment. This trend suggests a potential shift in international education preferences amid changing global dynamics.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has moved to permanently restrict landlords from evicting tenants for the purpose of substantial remodels, a practice known as "renoviction." An amendment to the city's "just cause" ordinance will now require landlords to obtain a Government Agency Order to vacate a unit for renovations, typically issued for safety code violations. This measure aims to close a loophole that some landlords allegedly used to displace tenants and subsequently raise rents for new occupants. The city is also developing rules to ensure tenants are properly relocated and can return to their units at a controlled rent increase post-renovation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a provision in a new law that would cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The lawsuit, filed by the reproductive health provider, argued that the provision unconstitutionally targets the organization for providing legal abortion services, even though federal funds are not used for them. The order ensures that Medicaid funding continues for 14 days, with a hearing scheduled for later in July. Planned Parenthood stated the cut would be devastating for its million-plus Medicaid patients and could force clinic closures.</p>

          <p>China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa in an effort to boost its post-pandemic tourism and economy. The move has been praised by international travelers and tour operators, who report a surge in interest and bookings. In 2024, over 20 million foreign visitors entered China without a visa, more than double the previous year's figure. While the U.S. is not on the 30-day list, its citizens can utilize a more restrictive 10-day transit visa option available at certain ports of entry.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will terminate its partnership with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the program misled students. The lawsuit claimed a jointly offered cybersecurity boot camp was part of Caltech "in name only," with minimal connection to university faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Caltech and Simplilearn agreed to new transparency rules and will provide tuition refunds to over 260 students totaling $2.4 million. The decision marks a significant development in the scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online course providers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has canceled its plan for a large-scale reduction-in-force, or mass layoff, that was scheduled for August. The agency now expects to reduce its staff by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, eliminating the need for forced layoffs. The initial plan, which aimed to cut the workforce by up to 80,000, had drawn criticism. VA Secretary Doug Collins stated that a department-wide review showed the agency was headed in the right direction and that a mass RIF was now "off the table."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by Commissioner Rob Manfred. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed his gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that while his performance this season might not typically warrant a selection, he intends to enjoy the experience. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a planned $2.2 billion follow-on purchase of 36 AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters. The decision was reportedly influenced by a 66% increase in the aircraft's cost and a strategic shift based on lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted the vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones. A member of South Korea's National Assembly stated that the country must invest in future-warfare capabilities like drones and smart systems rather than expensive legacy platforms. The funds will likely be reallocated to develop these emerging military technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event was officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was created after Budapest's liberal mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. The decision comes as a relief to the record-breaking crowd of over 200,000 who attended. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has enacted several anti-LGBTQ+ policies, including a law passed in March that allows for the banning of Pride marches.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is beginning a three-day state visit to the United Kingdom, which will emphasize the need for cooperation on shared threats like military aggression and climate change. The visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit, will feature a state banquet at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles III. The trip is seen as a key "soft power" opportunity to reinforce the UK-France alliance on trade, defense, and diplomacy. Discussions between Macron and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are also expected to cover joint efforts to stop illegal migration across the English Channel.</p>
