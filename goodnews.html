        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nottingham Forest has appointed Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing Nuno Espirito Santo who was dismissed after just three games into the season. Postecoglou, 60, returns to management three months after being sacked by Tottenham, despite leading them to a Europa League victory. Forest's owner, Evangelos Marinakis, cited Postecoglou's consistent record of winning trophies as a key reason for the appointment, aiming to elevate the club to compete for major honors. The move, which surprised many players, signals a strategic shift for the club, which currently sits 10th in the Premier League.</p>

          <p>Sam Curran is set to return to England's T20 cricket team for the first match against South Africa in Cardiff. This marks his first appearance under head coach Brendon McCullum since November 2024, following an impressive performance in The Hundred competition. Curran's inclusion addresses the team's need for a seam bowling all-rounder, a role that was conspicuously vacant during the recent one-day international series. His return is part of a lineup that also includes opener Phil Salt, with several other players being rested ahead of a packed international schedule.</p>

The deal underscores the sustained high demand for AI computing resources, boosting investor confidence in the sector despite recent concerns about a potential market bubble.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis reveals a recurring pattern in trade deals under the Trump administration where partner countries announce large-scale purchases of Boeing aircraft. High-profile orders from nations like South Korea, Japan, and the UK serve as visible, high-value symbols of commitment to reducing trade surpluses with the U.S. Experts suggest these deals are politically advantageous, as aircraft imports are less controversial than agricultural or steel products and fulfill a genuine need in the growing international tourism market. This strategy allows for politically symbolic agreements while leveraging the iconic status of Boeing as a major American company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they describe as one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom: a "virgin birth" by a female casque-headed iguana. The iguana, which had never been in contact with a male, produced eight healthy hatchlings through a natural phenomenon called parthenogenesis. In this process, unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that are genetic clones of the mother. The zoo staff expressed astonishment at the fertile eggs and see the event as a valuable opportunity for conservation education about genetics and evolution.</p>

A CBRE analysis shows that the pool of tech workers with AI skills has grown by over 50% in the past year, with concentrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Seattle. Unlike the broader tech sector, which has embraced remote work, AI development often requires in-office collaboration, boosting office leasing activity.

The article discusses how she navigates the complex legacy of a man who publicly projected the image of a country squire while privately struggling with alcoholism and closeted homosexuality. The piece reflects on how these hidden torments and deep anxieties fueled the "flighty, eccentric, and sometimes bitter work" that defined his celebrated short stories.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Michael Clune's new novel, "Pan," examines its portrayal of an adolescent boy besieged by panic attacks in the early 1990s. The article notes Clune's unique, impressionistic style, previously seen in his heroin addiction memoir "White Out," which captures the subjective, sensory distortion of panic with vivid precision. Rather than following a clinical or recovery-focused plot, the novel treats the protagonist's anxiety as a philosophical and metaphysical quest, exploring its connection to the Greek god Pan. The book is described as a bracing mix of coming-of-age story and intellectual exploration.</p>
