          <p>Qualifying for personal loan debt forgiveness is not as straightforward as with student loans, but options exist to reduce what you owe. Debt settlement can be a viable path forward if you are behind on payments and experiencing financial hardship. Lenders may agree to accept less than what you owe, typically in exchange for a lump-sum payment. If you don't qualify, consider debt management plans or refinancing, and always communicate with your lender. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's recent 20-year agreement with Constellation Energy to purchase nuclear power is boosting the data center trade. The agreement will allow Meta to buy about 1.1 gigawatts of energy from Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center in Illinois, starting in June 2027. This move highlights the growing power needs of AI data centers, which benefits companies like GE Vernova and Eaton. GE Vernova's stock has seen significant growth since the purchase.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after 28 years, becoming the 51st person freed in a case linked to disgraced former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being framed for murder, according to his lawyers. He walked into CPD headquarters in 1997 after being shot, but was then framed as the perpetrator in an unrelated murder after refusing to falsely identify someone. Prosecutors dropped the carjacking charge, emphasizing Guevara's pattern of misconduct.</p>
