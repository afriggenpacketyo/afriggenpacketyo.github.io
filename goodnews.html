          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching an emergency task force and considering flight reductions to address ongoing safety and efficiency concerns at Newark Liberty International Airport. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed recent telecommunications issues to the previous administration's handling of air traffic control relocation. The task force will include experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris to identify and resolve the root causes of the disruptions. The FAA will also meet with airlines to discuss potential flight reductions to alleviate congestion, with United Airlines already cutting some flights. These measures aim to improve the airport's infrastructure and prevent future outages, ensuring safer and more reliable travel for passengers.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's GDP grew by 3.4% in 2024, marking its highest growth rate in ten years, driven by recovery in the oil and gas sector and strong performance in technology and finance. The World Bank projects a slight increase to 3.7% in 2025, but warns of slow growth in the agriculture sector due to insecurity and high input costs. Despite the economic progress, poverty remains high, with nearly half of Nigerians living in poverty, and inflation is expected to stay above 20%. President Bola Tinubu's government has implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the currency, but these measures have increased the cost of living for many Nigerians.</p>

After his release and subsequent election to Congress, he returned to Vietnam, seeking accountability for missing Americans. Appointed ambassador in 1997, he focused on building trust and fostering diplomatic relations, leading to key trade agreements and safety initiatives.

          <p>Gold prices have surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs due to factors like unpredictable US trade policies and geopolitical instability. Investors view gold as a safe haven asset, leading to increased demand. Central banks have also been net buyers of gold, further driving up prices. However, experts caution that gold prices are subject to fluctuations, and previous surges have been followed by significant declines. While some analysts predict continued growth, others warn of a potential market bubble, advising investors to diversify their portfolios and avoid speculative short-term investments.

          <p>Doctors and researchers are reevaluating who should take GLP-1 drugs, recognizing that their benefits extend beyond weight loss.

The focus is shifting to reducing visceral fat, which is linked to various chronic diseases. GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing this type of fat and improving metabolic health. Identifying individuals with excess visceral fat and related health issues is crucial for determining appropriate use of these medications, with waist size and blood-lipid patterns serving as key indicators.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Race to Discover Why the Universe Exists</h2>

          <p>Scientists in the US and Japan are in a race to discover why the Universe exists by studying neutrinos. The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper K) in Japan are building detectors to study these sub-atomic particles. Scientists believe that understanding the differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos could explain why matter and antimatter didn't cancel each other out after the Big Bang, leaving us with the universe we see today. Both experiments are international collaborations and hope to make transformative discoveries about the origin of the Universe.</p>
