          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Instagram has reached a new milestone of 3 billion monthly active users, a significant increase from the 2 billion reported in October 2022. This places the photo-sharing app in the same league as Meta's other major platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The growth comes after Meta ceased its practice of disclosing individual app user numbers on a quarterly basis in April 2024, instead reporting a combined figure for its family of apps, which reached 3.48 billion daily active people in July.</p>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a colossal object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole, a type theorized to have formed before the first stars. This discovery challenges the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed first and later collapsed into black holes. If confirmed, the existence of such an object would necessitate a significant revision of our understanding of the universe's evolution, suggesting black holes could have formed directly from quantum fluctuations shortly after the Big Bang.</p>

The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a joint venture with General Motors. In exchange for more favorable loan repayment terms, the administration has requested a small equity share to mitigate risk for taxpayers, signaling a direct White House interest in securing critical mineral supply chains.

          <p>Tom Brady has responded to criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox, stating that only the "paranoid and distrustful" see a conflict of interest. Critics argue his access to other teams as an analyst gives the Raiders an unfair advantage, a debate that intensified after he was seen in the Raiders' coaching booth. Brady asserted that his passion for football creates an ethical duty to improve the game, not a conflict, and that his roles intersect from a place of principle.</p>

          <p>A trio of satellites from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center to study space weather. The $1.6 billion joint mission aims to provide a comprehensive picture of solar storms, which can create auroras but also disrupt communications and endanger astronauts. One key satellite, the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), will also offer a crucial 30-minute advance warning of solar storms, enhancing safety for future lunar missions under the Artemis program.</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell revealed that the league might renegotiate its media rights deals as soon as 2026, four years ahead of the current contract's opt-out clause. An earlier renegotiation of the 11-year, $111 billion deal could add billions in revenue and allow media partners like Disney, Amazon, and Fox to secure valuable NFL content for longer. Goodell cited the rapidly changing media landscape as the reason for seeking flexibility, noting that new agreements could significantly impact future salary caps and team valuations.
