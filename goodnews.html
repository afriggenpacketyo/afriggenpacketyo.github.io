          <p>President Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz as a federal prison has been met with disbelief and criticism from tourists visiting the island, with many questioning the practicality and cost of such an endeavor. The former prison, now a popular tourist attraction and National Historic Landmark, faces significant deterioration and logistical challenges, making the idea seem unrealistic to many. While some officials have stated they will assess the possibility, others have dismissed the idea as absurd, highlighting the importance of Alcatraz as a historical site and educational destination.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, a key justification for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment enables the gang, the Maduro regime does not direct its operations in the United States. The release of the memo further undermines the Trump administration's rationale and raises questions about its criticism of media coverage on the issue.</p>

          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The legislation provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities receive up to $30,000 annually, and home-schooled students get $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the bill hurts public schools by diverting funds to private institutions, primarily benefiting wealthier students.</p>

The creation of the city coincides with SpaceX's request to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 per year.</p>
