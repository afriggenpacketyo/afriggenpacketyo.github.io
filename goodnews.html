          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren won the Monaco Grand Prix, converting his pole position into a race lead and managing pit stops effectively. Charles Leclerc of Ferrari and Oscar Piastri of McLaren followed, completing the podium. Max Verstappen of Red Bull, disadvantaged by limited tire sets, finished fourth after a late pit stop, having initially led by delaying his final stop in hopes of a safety car intervention. The race saw an early virtual safety car due to a crash, but otherwise remained relatively straightforward for the front-runners, who largely adhered to a similar strategy.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the recently passed budget bill, claiming it represents the largest spending cut in decades, despite concerns it could increase the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill's tax provisions could increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion over the next decade, a figure Johnson disputes. He asserts the bill will stimulate the economy by raising wages and incentivizing business expansion and U.S. manufacturing. Republican senators have expressed reservations about the bill's impact on the deficit, signaling potential changes in the Senate.</p>

The invitation comes at a time when Canada seeks to strengthen ties with Europe and find new allies amid a changing relationship with the US. The King's visit marks a rare occasion, as a British monarch has not delivered Canada's throne speech since 1977.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis has sparked a debate among experts regarding prostate cancer screening guidelines, particularly for men over 70. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA screening with their doctor, but advises against it for those over 70 due to potential over-treatment risks. Some experts argue that men over 45 should have routine screening, regardless of age, citing advancements in treatment options. Doctors emphasize the importance of individual discussions to weigh the benefits and risks of screening based on health status and life expectancy.</p>

Protecting ecosystems would recognize their dynamic nature and allow for species movement and evolution. An ecosystem-protection act could ensure that each type of ecosystem has sufficient area protected, supporting biodiversity without the need for individual plans for each species.</p>

          <p>A new parenting approach called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open conversations. This style sets clear boundaries while encouraging independence and self-awareness.
