          <p>Google has partnered with nuclear startup Kairos Power to deploy an advanced Hermes 2 nuclear reactor to help power its data centers in the Tennessee Valley. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has agreed to purchase up to 50 megawatts of power from the plant, which is expected to be operational by 2030. This collaboration aims to commercialize smaller, more affordable nuclear technology without placing the financial risk of construction on consumers. The project represents a significant step in using reliable, carbon-free energy to meet the growing electricity demands of artificial intelligence and large-scale data processing.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Tom Barrack announced that a potential ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel is advancing after Beirut endorsed a U.S.-supported plan for the disarmament of Hezbollah. Following meetings with Lebanese leaders, Barrack stated that the next step requires Israel to reciprocate the Lebanese government's commitment to the plan. The proposal has angered the Iran-backed Hezbollah, which has vowed to resist disarmament, raising concerns about potential civil unrest in Lebanon. The diplomatic efforts aim to resolve the long-standing conflict that has caused significant economic damage and instability in the region.</p>

          <p>The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale classifies hurricanes into five categories based on their sustained wind speeds, providing an estimate of potential property damage. A Category 1 storm features winds of 74-95 mph causing "some damage," while a Category 5 storm has winds of 157 mph or higher and is capable of causing "catastrophic damage." Storms rated as Category 3 or higher are designated as "major" hurricanes due to their potential for significant loss of life. This article breaks down the characteristics of each category, citing historical examples like Hurricane Katrina (Category 3 at landfall) and Hurricane Andrew (Category 5) to illustrate their destructive power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced significant reforms to the country's goods and services tax (GST) regime, aiming to simplify the system and boost domestic consumption. The plan involves consolidating tax brackets, which is expected to benefit key sectors like manufacturing, logistics, and automotive industries that have seen sluggish growth. This economic stimulus is seen as a way to bolster India's economy, which is heavily reliant on domestic spending, and counteract the negative impact of ongoing U.S. tariffs on Indian imports. The move has been met with positive reactions from Indian financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has launched a new recruitment initiative that utilizes social media influencers to reach potential Gen Z enlistees. The strategy involves partnerships with lifestyle content creators, such as fitness influencers and chefs, who create sponsored posts depicting their experiences with military training and activities. This modern approach aims to increase the Army's visibility among younger audiences who may have limited exposure to military life. The campaign has drawn some criticism, with some social media users labeling it as propaganda, but it reflects a broader trend of using influencers to market careers and lifestyles in an economically uncertain time.</p>

          <p>American culinary preferences are increasingly embracing heat, with a significant rise in the consumption of spicy foods. Over half of U.S. consumers now report they are likely to purchase spicy items, a trend driven by younger generations, greater global culinary exposure, and the food industry's use of spice as a cost-effective flavor enhancer. This has led to the proliferation of extremely hot products, like those using the Carolina Reaper pepper, in mainstream outlets. As consumer tolerance for spiciness grows, food manufacturers are introducing even hotter options, suggesting a self-perpetuating cycle that is fundamentally changing the nation's palate.</p>

          <p>Doctors at a Shanghai hospital have successfully saved a patient who suffered a near-decapitation injury from a robotic arm in an industrial accident. The patient's cervical vertebrae were completely severed and crucial blood vessels were damaged, causing instant paralysis and a heart attack. Surgeons reported that while the spinal cord sustained serious contusions, it remained intact, allowing for the life-saving procedure. The medical team noted the extreme rarity and severity of the injury, stating they had never encountered a case of such severe cervical separation where the patient survived following treatment.</p>

          <p>Legendary director Francis Ford Coppola has undertaken a six-city tour in an unconventional effort to build a cult following for his 2024 film, "Megalopolis." The epic, which was self-funded, critically panned, and a box office flop, is the subject of these live events where Coppola engages in lengthy, unmoderated discussions on the movie's themes. Unlike the organic process through which most cult classics emerge over time, Coppola is actively trying to facilitate a reappraisal of his work. The tour has drawn sold-out crowds, suggesting a fascination not just with the film, but with the spectacle of a famed auteur defending and mythologizing his passion project.</p>

          <p>Nearly a year after losing his 2024 reelection bid, former Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown has announced he will run for the Senate again in 2026 to represent Ohio. Brown, who had been the only Democrat holding statewide office in Ohio, was defeated in a challenging race in a state that has trended Republican.

          <p>Shipping container data reveals that major retailers Walmart and Target proactively imported large quantities of goods, such as holiday decorations and popular toys, ahead of threatened U.S. tariffs on Chinese products. This "front-loading" strategy aimed to manage costs and ensure product availability by shipping items earlier than usual during periods of tariff uncertainty. While this approach helps avoid higher duties, it can also lead to increased freight and storage costs, as seen when Target reported an earnings miss attributed to absorbing these expenses. The data illustrates how retailers are navigating volatile trade policies to maintain supply chain stability. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks the first government-coordinated medical evacuation of children from the conflict zone to the UK. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel. The initiative follows a letter from a cross-party group of MPs urging the government to act swiftly to help children at risk due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.

          <p>During his recent summit with President Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, Russian President Vladimir Putin gifted a new Ural motorcycle to a local resident. The man, Mark Warren, had been interviewed by Russian state television prior to the summit, where he mentioned his old Ural motorcycle and the difficulty of obtaining spare parts due to production moving out of Russia. Following the report, the Russian embassy presented Warren with a brand-new model as a personal gift from President Putin. Warren expressed his shock and gratitude for the unexpected gesture, which served as a moment of soft diplomacy during the high-level talks.</p>
