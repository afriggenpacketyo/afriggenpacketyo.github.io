          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding an August 1st deadline for higher tariffs. The deal establishes a baseline 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened but higher than the EU's preferred 10%. As part of the accord, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making an additional $600 billion in investments. European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have welcomed the agreement for providing stability and avoiding a more damaging trade conflict. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a concert in Warsaw, Poland, celebrating her 56th birthday, Jennifer Lopez experienced a wardrobe malfunction when her gold sequined skirt unexpectedly fell off mid-performance. The incident occurred as she was acknowledging birthday wishes from the audience, briefly leaving her in her matching underwear. A backup dancer quickly came to her aid, but Lopez handled the situation with humor, tossing the broken garment into the crowd. She later joked that she was glad she had chosen to wear underwear for the show, as she often does not.</p>

          <p>In a live update, the Trump administration detailed its new trade deal with the European Union, which includes a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy. President Trump also addressed the humanitarian situation in Gaza, stating the U.S. has provided significant aid but has not been properly thanked by other nations. He expressed a desire for more international participation in providing aid and noted that much of the food is reportedly stolen by Hamas. Trump also affirmed his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while criticizing Iran's rhetoric.</p>

          <h2>San Diego Comic-Con Attendees Find Value Despite Absence of Major Marvel Panel</h2>

          <p>Despite initial concerns over the absence of a major Marvel Studios panel, many attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con found the experience enjoyable and less crowded. The lack of blockbuster studio presentations in the famed Hall H allowed fans easier access to other panels, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "The Long Walk." While some spectacle was missing, the event still featured major draws like a "Demon Slayer" panel and an appearance by DC Studios' James Gunn. The shift highlights a potential change in the pop culture landscape, with television, anime, and fan-centric activities becoming more central to the Comic-Con experience.</p>

          <p>Following the England women's national football team's dramatic penalty shootout victory against Spain in the Euro 2025 final, the team has received widespread praise from national leaders. King Charles celebrated the "awesome teamwork" of the Lionesses, stating they made the chant "football's coming home" ring true. Prince William and Princess Charlotte, who attended the match in Switzerland, expressed their pride, while Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the team as "history makers." An open-top bus parade is scheduled in London to celebrate the team becoming the first to retain a women's European Championship.</p>

          <p>Despite the historic victory of England's Lionesses in the Euro 2025 final, Downing Street has indicated there are no plans to announce a special bank holiday to mark the occasion. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's previous Euro win in 2022 and the men's World Cup victory in 1966. While a celebratory parade is scheduled, the government appears to be avoiding the economic cost associated with an extra public holiday, which has been estimated at over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, has not pushed for it this time.</p>

          <p>A new trade framework between the U.S. and the European Union introduces several key changes to the transatlantic economic relationship. Most EU goods will now face a 15% baseline tariff, including cars, though tariffs on steel and aluminum will remain at 50% for now. Notably, the deal establishes zero tariffs for aircraft, certain chemicals, and semiconductor equipment. In a significant commitment, the EU has pledged to purchase $750 billion of U.S. liquefied natural gas over three years and U.S. military equipment, while European companies are set to invest an additional $600 billion in the United States.

He noted that while some federal research grants have been impacted, the financial effect is minor compared to the university's overall $1.6 billion research revenue.
