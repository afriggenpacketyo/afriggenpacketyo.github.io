          <p>Despite the growing popularity of women's football in Europe, Poland was the only Eastern European nation to qualify for Euro 2025, highlighting a significant regional disparity. The article explores the reasons for this gap, citing a lack of investment, underdeveloped infrastructure, and persistent cultural biases that discourage girls from playing football. While UEFA initiatives are starting to make an impact, historical and political factors, including the legacy of communism and the rise of conservative values, have also hindered progress. Experts suggest that a major tournament hosted in the region could be a catalyst for change.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread concern over President Trump's threatened tariffs, U.S. stock markets like the S&P 500 have reached record highs. The article explains this apparent paradox by pointing to a resilient economy, a strong labor market, and better-than-feared corporate earnings reports from major companies. Another key factor is a market belief that the president's tariff threats are often more severe than his eventual actions, a sentiment dubbed the "TACO trade" (Trump Always Chickens Out). However, analysts remain cautious, noting that significant trade negotiations are still pending and that expensive stock prices are vulnerable to unexpected shocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article details a wave of pushback from prominent comedians following the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" by Paramount-owned CBS, which came after a major corporate merger. Jon Stewart and the creators of "South Park" used their platforms to deliver sharp satire aimed at corporate self-censorship and the potential influence of political pressure on media decisions. Colbert himself has adopted a more defiant tone, vowing the "gloves are off" for his remaining shows. This response highlights how satirists can directly and immediately challenge perceived corporate or political intimidation in a way other media cannot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by J. Randy Taraborrelli, "JFK: Private, Public Secret," alleges that First Lady Jackie Kennedy specifically warned her husband about Marilyn Monroe, viewing her as potentially more "trouble" than his other affairs. The book claims Jackie confronted JFK about the actress before Monroe's famous "Happy Birthday" performance, which the first lady deliberately chose not to attend. However, the author, citing Monroe's publicist Pat Newcomb, also casts doubt on whether an affair between JFK and Monroe ever actually occurred. The book suggests the story may have been a "figment of Marilyn's imagination."</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to planning and licensing rules in England and Wales to better protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints. The reforms would require developers building new homes near existing venues to incorporate soundproofing and would also fast-track permissions for new businesses and outdoor dining. These changes aim to reverse the steady decline of the pub industry by reducing bureaucratic hurdles and supporting the hospitality sector. The proposal comes after several beloved venues faced closure due to noise complaints from newly arrived residents.</p>

The plan envisions key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, keeping the economy active around the clock to boost productivity and shift Ghana from an import-based to a self-sufficient model. While the policy is ambitious and could create millions of jobs, economists raise concerns about its feasibility. Hurdles include securing the necessary billions in funding, developing required infrastructure like a stable power supply, and getting the private sector to fully commit to the vision.</p>

The article highlights the sensitive nature of women's rights and domestic abuse in China, where the government often suppresses feminist discourse.
