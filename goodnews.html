          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States. Through a $400 million investment in preferred stock, the Pentagon aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for critical minerals used in advanced military technology like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership is designed to reduce U.S. reliance on China for rare earths and accelerate the onshoring of magnet manufacturing capabilities. The company's CEO, James Litinsky, emphasized that this is not a nationalization but a strategic collaboration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian confectionery giant Ferrero has agreed to acquire American cereal company WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, bringing iconic brands like Froot Loops and Frosted Flakes under its ownership. This move is part of Ferrero's broader strategy to expand its presence in North America, following previous acquisitions of brands like Butterfinger and Halo Top ice cream. The deal comes as WK Kellogg faces challenges from changing consumer habits, with shoppers shifting towards store brands or healthier options. The acquisition is now subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC has published its 19th annual "America's Top States for Business" study, ranking all 50 states based on 135 metrics across ten categories of competitiveness. The 2025 methodology places the highest weight on the "Economy" category and introduces new metrics to evaluate states' risks from trade wars and federal budget cuts. The study uses data-driven analysis rather than opinion surveys to measure state performance in areas critical for business site selection. The rankings are designed to identify which states are most effectively attracting and supporting business development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has announced plans to expand the service area for the company's robotaxi in Austin, Texas, with a potential launch in the Bay Area pending regulatory approval. Additionally, Musk stated that xAI's chatbot, Grok, will be integrated into Tesla vehicles in the near future, following the release of its latest version, Grok 4. These developments occur amid a turbulent period for Musk, who has been in public disagreements with the Trump administration, impacting Tesla's stock value.

          <p>Massachusetts has climbed 18 spots to rank as the 20th best state for business in CNBC's 2025 study, making it the most improved state of the year. This turnaround is largely attributed to its relative financial independence from Washington D.C., a key factor in this year's rankings due to potential federal budget cuts. The state's economy, with a smaller federal workforce and lower dependency on federal funds, showed significant improvement. However, Massachusetts still faces challenges, including being the second-most-expensive state for business and having a heavy regulatory environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the end of Syria's civil war, firefighters from the former Assad regime are now working alongside the White Helmets, the volunteer first responders who operated in rebel-held territories. At a firehouse in Damascus, these two groups, once on opposing sides of a brutal conflict, are navigating a difficult integration process marked by suspicion and vastly different past experiences. Despite physical and psychological barriers, they are responding to emergencies together, slowly building trust through shared work and personal stories. This microcosm reflects Syria's broader challenge of reconciling a divided society while rebuilding the nation.</p>

CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings have stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, they remain below initial forecasts, leading to a revised full-year earnings outlook of $5.25 to $6.25 per share. The airline's positive performance was driven by strong sales of premium seats and its lucrative partnership with American Express. This news provided a lift to the entire airline sector, as Delta was the first major U.S. carrier to report its second-quarter results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom cooling hardware, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), to manage the immense heat generated by next-generation Nvidia AI processors. As AI workloads intensify, the energy-hungry GPUs require more effective cooling solutions than traditional methods can provide. Instead of building new data centers for liquid cooling, Amazon designed the IRHX to be integrated into its existing infrastructure, allowing it to support the scale of its operations. This development enables AWS to offer services based on Nvidia's powerful GB200 NVL72 systems, keeping it competitive in the AI cloud market.</p>

The tax hike is intended to improve public health and generate revenue as the nation prepares for demographic shifts that will increase healthcare costs.

Drivers are also motivated by lower running costs, with charging being significantly cheaper than fuel and maintenance expenses being reduced.

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," explores the history of the Grateful Dead's "Wall of Sound," a revolutionary but ultimately impractical sound system from the early 1970s. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley "Bear" Stanley, the massive rig was designed to provide a perfectly clear and consistent audio experience for the entire audience by placing the entire PA system behind the band. While utopian in theory, the system was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and being prone to technical failures. The immense cost and complexity of the wall contributed to the band's temporary hiatus in 1974.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic hurricane season is currently quiet, with the National Hurricane Center not expecting any tropical cyclone formation within the next seven days.

However, forecasters at AccuWeather are monitoring the potential for a "homegrown" system to develop in the Gulf of Mexico or off the U.S. Southeast coast around mid-July. If a storm does form, it is expected to be a tropical depression or a weak tropical storm rather than a hurricane, similar to the development of Tropical Storm Chantal earlier in the season.</p>

OPEC's 2050 World Oil Outlook projects that oil and gas will still constitute over 50% of the global energy mix by mid-century.
