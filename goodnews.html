          <h2>Katy Perry Experiences Onstage Prop Malfunction During Concert</h2>

          <p>During a concert in San Francisco, pop star Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding. While suspended over the audience and singing her hit "Roar," the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without further incident, later making a lighthearted comment about the malfunction. This type of aerial prop is common in large-scale concerts, with other artists occasionally facing similar technical difficulties during their shows.</p>

          <p>Actors Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O’Connell, married for 18 years, have revealed their unique approach to managing their finances. The couple maintains separate bank accounts and contributes quarterly to a "community pot" for shared family expenses. The amount each contributes varies depending on who is working more at the time, a system they adopted to support their decision to always have one parent at home with their twin daughters. This financial independence is part of the unconventional framework that has supported their long-lasting Hollywood marriage.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy captivated the home crowd at Royal Portrush with a dramatic third round, giving himself an outside chance at winning The Open. Despite a bizarre incident where his shot unearthed another golf ball buried in the rough, leading to a bogey, he responded with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt that ignited the gallery. He finished with a round of 66, leaving him at eight under par and tied for fourth place. While still six shots behind the leader, McIlroy's resilient and exciting performance has provided a major storyline for the tournament's final day.</p>

          <p>Following reports of Justin Bieber's $31.5 million settlement with former manager Scooter Braun, speculation arose about whether his wife Hailey Bieber's recent business success was involved. Hailey's skincare brand, Rhode, was recently acquired by e.l.f. Beauty in a deal reportedly valued at $1 billion. However, a representative for Hailey has clarified that the sale of Rhode is a significant achievement for her and is completely separate from her husband's business and financial affairs. The deal positions Hailey as a chief creative officer and strategic advisor for the brand she founded in 2022.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler has taken firm control of The Open Championship, heading into the final round with a four-shot lead. Through three rounds at Royal Portrush, Scheffler has played with relentless consistency, posting a score of 14 under par. His performance has created an air of inevitability, as he has won on the last nine occasions he held a 54-hole lead. A victory would mark his fourth major championship and move him one step closer to a career grand slam, solidifying his status as the most dominant player in the sport.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy focus toward stronger cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a trilateral alliance known as the "E3." This strategic shift, marked by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future US commitments to European security under NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized the need for Europe to become more self-reliant in defense, viewing the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK as a potential supplement to US protection. This move signals a significant realignment in European security and diplomatic strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to signing Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, who has been out of favor at his current club since last December. The move, likely an initial loan with an option to buy, comes after Barcelona failed to secure other targets for their left-wing position. For Barcelona, the deal represents a low-risk opportunity to acquire a talented, experienced player who could be a major asset if he rediscovers his top form. For Manchester United, it provides a way to offload an unwanted player as the club looks to rebuild its squad under manager Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <p>The Pennsylvania-based Christian group Generation Life is engaging in "beach outreach" at the Jersey shore, speaking with young people about love, relationships, and chastity. The activists aim to present a countercultural message, suggesting that true intimacy and self-worth are found outside of modern hookup culture, which they see as transactional and damaging, particularly due to social media. Rather than focusing on abstinence, they define chastity as seeing a person's whole worth. Their approach highlights the challenges of promoting a traditional message to a largely secular and sexually liberal generation.</p>
