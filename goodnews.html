Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow stated the merger simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics previously argued it suppressed shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Uganda, a company called EarthEnable offers an affordable alternative to dirt floors using clay-based earthen floors. These floors cost less than half the price of concrete and provide a durable, sealed surface.

The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which generates major carbon emissions in production.</p>
