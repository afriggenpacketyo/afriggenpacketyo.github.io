          <h2>Trump Receives Lavish Welcome and Economic Pledges During Middle East Tour</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 00:01:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent tour of the Middle East was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and immigration. During the trip, Trump secured over $2 trillion in economic investments from these nations, including deals for Boeing jets and G.E. engines, with potential investments reaching $4 trillion. He also used a stop at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as a campaign-style rally, praising his administration's policies and falsely claiming victory in the 2020 election. The article emphasizes the transactional nature of the relationships and the absence of protests, a stark contrast to the receptions Trump might receive in Europe or Latin America.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is significantly increasing its investments and influence across Africa, filling a void as the United States and China reduce their presence on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, critical minerals, and renewable energy projects, with announced deals totaling $110 billion since 2019. While the U.S. reduces its funding and dismantles agencies like U.S.A.I.D., the Emirates is looking to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels, seeing Africa as essential due to its vast resources and strategic location. However, the Emirates' political choices, such as its involvement in Sudan, have raised concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue only its second dust storm warning for the area. High winds blowing over dry farmlands collected dust into the air, reducing visibility to near zero in some areas and forcing drivers to pull over on Interstate 55. The storm also impacted Midway International Airport, halting incoming flights for about an hour, and disrupted a high school graduation ceremony in Morris, Illinois. Skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas affected by the storm.</p>

          <p>Sneaker Impact, a Miami-based recycling company, is giving donated sneakers a second life by either reusing or recycling them, depending on their condition. Reusable shoes are shipped outside of the U.S., where they are resold by small businesses in developing countries, providing affordable footwear and reducing waste. Shoes that cannot be reused are crushed and repurposed into materials like flooring, mats, and textiles. The company aims to develop an environmentally friendly business model, hoping others will replicate its efforts to combat landfill waste.</p>
