          <p>Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams expressed his negative experiences with Green Bay Packers fans, recounting an incident where fans threw objects and pushed players attempting the Lambeau Leap after a Bears victory. Williams highlighted the intensity of the fan interaction at Lambeau Field, describing it as more aggressive than expected. Despite the Bears' struggles last season, Williams' performance has inspired hope among fans for a franchise quarterback. Williams completed 62.5% of his passes for 3,541 yards with 20 touchdowns and six interceptions during his first season, after being selected first overall in the 2024 NFL Draft out of USC. The first game between the Bears and the Packers next season will be held at Lambeau Field on December 7.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have been unsuccessful. Khalil, who was arrested on March 8 and held for over three months, vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants. He accused the White House of attempting to dehumanize those who disagree with the administration's policies. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joined Khalil, stating that his release indicates the Trump administration is losing its legal battle to deport migrants who support Palestinians. Khalil's release followed a judge's ruling that he was not a flight risk or a threat to the community.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling prevents a policy change that would have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding. Judge Indira Talwani deemed the change arbitrary and capricious, arguing it threatened critical work in various technology fields. The Trump administration had sought to cap indirect expenses for NSF grants to universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million annually.</p>
