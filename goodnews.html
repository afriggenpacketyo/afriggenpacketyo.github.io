          <p>President Trump, alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, announced that the tech giant is increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The investment is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes plans for a smart glass manufacturing line in Kentucky and a server facility in Houston. This move is part of a broader White House initiative to reshore critical supply chains and production to the United States.

          <h2>A Comparison of Earnings: $10,000 in a 6-Month CD vs. a Money Market Account</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential earnings of a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a money market account in the current economic climate. While both offer competitive interest rates, the CD provides a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas the money market account rate is variable and could fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Based on current rates, the 6-month CD would earn slightly more over the period. The analysis suggests that for savers prioritizing guaranteed returns over liquidity, a CD may be the more advantageous option right now. (not investment advice)</p>
