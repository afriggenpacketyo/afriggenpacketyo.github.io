          <p>Richard L. Garwin, a physicist who designed America's first hydrogen bomb at the young age of 23, passed away at 97. Despite his crucial role in developing the weapon, Garwin remained relatively unknown to the public for decades, with Edward Teller initially receiving most of the credit. He later advised numerous presidents on defense policies and contributed significantly to advancements in computing, communications, and medicine at IBM. Garwin also advocated for nuclear arms control and opposed the Star Wars missile defense system, emphasizing the importance of a strategic balance of power to deter nuclear attacks.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address overcrowding in prisons across England and Wales, the government will implement limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison will be released after a fixed 28-day period, freeing up approximately 1,400 prison spaces. This measure aims to provide ministers with time to overhaul the system, which is described as being "on the brink of collapse," while new prisons are being constructed. The changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years who are recalled for breaching their license terms, but not to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

          <p>Shares of the stock trading app eToro experienced a significant surge in their Nasdaq debut, climbing 40% after raising nearly $310 million in its initial public offering. The company, based in Israel, sold almost six million shares at $52 each, exceeding the anticipated range of $46 to $50, resulting in a market capitalization of $5.6 billion. This IPO is being closely watched as a potential indicator of renewed interest in IPOs following a prolonged slowdown. EToro, which had previously shelved plans to go public through a SPAC merger in 2022, has seen substantial growth in its cryptocurrency business, with revenue from crypto assets more than tripling in 2024.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have advanced President Donald Trump's tax bill, incorporating trillions of dollars in tax breaks. The House Ways and Means Committee approved the legislation after overnight debates, with a 26-19 party-line vote. However, disagreements persist over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which remains unresolved. While the bill proposes raising the SALT cap to $30,000 for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, some lawmakers advocate for a higher limit. The full House vote is anticipated as early as next week, but significant modifications are expected in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to review President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants and some temporary foreign residents, reigniting a long-standing legal debate. The challenge is based on the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. and subject to its jurisdiction. Trump has argued that the amendment was intended to address slavery, not tourism or immigration. Legal scholars and courts have largely upheld birthright citizenship, citing the 1898 case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, but the Supreme Court's decision could have significant implications for immigration policy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on bail. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri's detention was based on his First Amendment speech in support of Palestine and association with his wife and father-in-law. Suri, a visiting scholar with lawful status, could be released once ICE receives the written order. The judge concluded that Suri is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, allowing him to participate in his removal proceedings while out on bail.</p>

While some critics have voiced concerns about Qatar's role in the Gaza conflict and its relationship with Hamas, others have defended its efforts to mediate and facilitate hostage releases.

          <p>Amid ongoing fluctuations in U.S. tariff policies, consumers are seeking strategies to mitigate the impact on their household budgets. With recent agreements between the U.S. and China reducing tariffs, shopping expert Trae Bodge advises consumers to look for sales, check the origin of products, and purchase domestic goods. Electronics and toys are expected to be the most affected by tariffs, so shoppers should consider whether these items are worth purchasing. Bodge recommends that consumers consider purchasing items they were already planning to buy, such as dishwashers or cars, sooner rather than later, but advises against panic shopping.</p>

          <p>David Mauro, owner of Jesusdoll.com, is optimistic about the upcoming holiday season after the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs. The reduction in tariffs from 145% to 30% for 90 days means that Mauro's company, which produces talking religious toys, will be able to import products from China for Christmas. Over 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, making the tariff reduction crucial for retailers.

          <p>Hearing aids are becoming more accessible and advanced, with new options like glasses that double as hearing aids and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) gaining popularity. These devices are not only more affordable but also appeal to a younger demographic, breaking down the stigma associated with hearing loss. While traditional clinical hearing aids require adjustment and adaptation, the newer devices offer a more seamless integration into everyday life. The accessibility of hearing assistance is crucial, as sensory input is vital for connection and cognitive function.</p>

          <p>A blind taste test was conducted to determine the best plant-based meat products. The results showed that several products, particularly those from Impossible Foods and MorningStar Farms, were rated as good as or better than their animal-based counterparts. The test included burgers, chicken nuggets, breakfast sausage patties, and deli slices. The products were served as part of a dish, like they'd be eaten in regular life. The test demonstrated that, overall, plant-based meat still has a long way to go to compete with animal meat on flavor, texture, price, and other attributes.</p>
