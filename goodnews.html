Hours before Xi's arrival, Ukrainian drones were reportedly brought down near Moscow, causing temporary airport closures.

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts defended the independence of the judiciary and denounced attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings. Speaking in Buffalo, Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not a tool for registering disagreement with judicial decisions. His remarks followed similar comments by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized 'relentless attacks' on judges. Roberts's defense of judicial independence comes amid intense pressure on the Supreme Court and scrutiny of federal judges overseeing cases challenging the administration's policies.</p>

          <p>Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags to circumvent Republican-led state bans on flying 'unofficial flags' on government property. Salt Lake City approved three new city flags featuring the sego lily design over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise Mayor Lauren McLean issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. The actions are a response to measures restricting flag displays to state, U.S., and other specified flags.</p>
