          <h2>Nvidia to Resume Sales of H20 AI Chips to China Following US Government Assurances</h2>

          <p>Nvidia has announced it will soon resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, a significant development after sales were halted by U.S. export controls. The company stated it received assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary licenses will be granted. This move follows intensive lobbying by CEO Jensen Huang, who argued that the restrictions were hindering American tech leadership and had already damaged Nvidia's market share in China. The decision is seen by analysts as a major positive catalyst for the company's growth in the coming quarters.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administrative stay provides a one-week reprieve while the court considers the case, preventing the immediate revocation of deportation protections and work permits. Advocacy groups described the ruling as a critical but short-lived relief, emphasizing the need for a permanent legislative solution for Afghans who fled their country following the U.S. withdrawal and subsequent Taliban takeover.</p>

          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, a rate that surpassed economists' forecasts and exceeded Beijing's full-year target. This stronger-than-expected growth may alleviate pressure on policymakers to introduce significant new stimulus measures to support the economy. Despite the positive headline figure, underlying weaknesses remain, including slowing retail sales growth and a deepening slump in real estate investment, indicating that domestic demand is still insufficient.
