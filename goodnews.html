        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a 2.3% annual increase in April, slightly below economists' expectations, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs significantly contributed to the rise, although gasoline prices experienced a drop. Experts are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, but the effects may not be immediately apparent due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases, creating uncertainty for the Federal Reserve and global investors. The central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach on Mr. Trump's tariffs, which he said could boost inflation and blunt economic growth.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The evidence pointed to an unknown attacker in semen samples preserved from the crime scene. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. The Crown Prosecution Service agreed that the DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction, leading to his release.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration has temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, signaling a potential shift in his trade war strategy. Despite initial claims that China needed the U.S. more, the move suggests that America also relies on international trade. The tariff reduction, from 145% to 30%, aims to alleviate price hikes and supply shortages that threatened the U.S. economy. However, a 10% tariff remains in place against nearly all of America‚Äôs trading partners, and the long-term impact of these policies remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's trade policies with China reveals a pattern of bold claims followed by concessions without significant gains. Despite asserting that China needed the U.S. more, Trump's administration ultimately reduced tariffs on Chinese imports. This action reflects the mutually beneficial nature of trade and the potential economic consequences of high tariffs, including price increases and supply chain disruptions. While some tariffs remain, the reduction signals a recognition of the economic interdependence between the two nations.</p>
