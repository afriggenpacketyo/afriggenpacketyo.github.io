          <p>Following Anthony Albanese's re-election as Prime Minister, Australian markets experienced a downturn in early trading, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years, signaling Australians' desire for policy continuity amidst macroeconomic uncertainty.

Most other Asian markets were closed for public holidays. U.S. futures also showed a slight decline after a strong week on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In recent elections in Canada and Australia, center-left parties have seen their fortunes revived, while right-wing parties that adopted Trumpian tactics have suffered losses, indicating a complex impact of President Trump on global politics. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney explicitly campaigned against Trump's policies, while Australian leader Anthony Albanese saw an anti-Trump bump, suggesting that voters consider Trump when making decisions. The article notes that in Germany, the effect has been less direct, but still felt. An unpredictable American president can have unpredictable consequences for leaders abroad, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain is fast discovering.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes more popular, some experts warn against relying on it as a guaranteed solution for delayed motherhood due to the high costs and no guarantees, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000. Vardit Ravitsky from the Hastings Center argues that society pressures women to delay childbearing, and a better solution would be company policies supporting younger motherhood. The article also notes the increasing commercialization of fertility services, with private equity firms investing heavily in fertility clinics, raising concerns about warped incentives and pressure on doctors to generate more revenue.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among young women as a means of preserving their fertility, with the number of procedures having increased more than six times over from 2014 to 2023. Many women see it as a way to delay childbearing without compromising their chances of having children later in life. Experts note that the optimal age to freeze eggs is in one's 20s, as egg quality decreases with age. However, the procedure is expensive, costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees, and is not always covered by insurance.</p>

          <p>According to Savills, more than half of first-time buyers in the UK received financial assistance from their families to purchase homes last year, with an average contribution of ¬£55,572. This trend is attributed to high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. The proportion of first-time buyers receiving family help was slightly lower than the previous year but higher than most years since 2013. First-time buyers are leveraging family support to secure better mortgage rates amidst challenging lending conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Egg freezing has become a more common option for women to preserve their fertility, but the process is expensive, with a single cycle costing $12,000 to $15,000, not including storage and later fertilization. Dr. Lucky Sekhon emphasizes that egg quality decreases with age and that the optimal time to freeze eggs is in a woman's 20s. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, it raises questions about their motives and whether it's accessible to all women. Some critics caution that egg freezing doesn't guarantee success and argue for policies that support women having children earlier.</p>

          <p>Audrey Backeberg, who disappeared from her home in Wisconsin in 1962 at the age of 20, was recently found alive and well. The Sauk County Sheriff's Office said that Backeberg's disappearance was by her own choice and not the result of any criminal activity or foul play. Backeberg, now 82, lives outside of Wisconsin. Detective Isaac Hanson located her through her sister's ancestry.com account and spoke to her by phone, learning that an abusive husband may have played a role in her initial decision to leave.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper lost to Casper Ruud in the Madrid Open final, but his performance on the clay court underlined his potential as a serious force in tennis. Andy Murray has previously said that Draper has the potential to become world number one. Draper's serve and forehand were vital tools in his success throughout the tournament. Ruud, a leading clay-courter, acknowledged Draper's talent and predicted he would become increasingly difficult to play on clay.</p>
