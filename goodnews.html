          <p>A minor earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 3.0 struck Bergen County, New Jersey, causing tremors felt across the tri-state area, including parts of New York City. The United States Geological Survey reported the event was centered six miles below Hasbrouck Heights. While the shaking was felt up to 60 miles away, there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. This article notes this follows other recent small quakes and a larger 4.8 magnitude event in the previous year.</p>

          <p>Analysts are debating whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend China's upcoming World War II 80th anniversary victory parade in Beijing. Some experts, like Vijay Prashad of Tricontinental, suggest that Modi's presence could provide an opportunity for China, India, and Russia to hold a tripartite meeting and help resolve ongoing border disputes. However, other observers believe Modi is unlikely to participate, despite a recent improvement in relations between the two nations. The article highlights the complex diplomatic considerations and potential domestic implications of such a visit for India.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a method for drone swarms to create a protective "storm eye" for friendly forces during electronic warfare. By coordinating the signals from multiple drones, the system can selectively jam enemy communications while creating a null zone where allied signals are unaffected. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement over traditional omnidirectional jamming, which disrupts all signals within its range, including those of friendly units. The technology aims to provide a strategic advantage by maintaining secure communications for the People's Liberation Army while disabling adversaries.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application meeting. Her detention stemmed from a years-old deportation order she was unaware of, issued after her mother, who had abandoned her as a teen, missed an immigration hearing. Her case drew attention due to her husband's military service and the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement policies.</p>
