          <p>An agreement for the first phase of a peace plan has been reached between Israel and Hamas, set to begin with a ceasefire upon approval by the Israeli Cabinet. The initial stage involves an Israeli troop pullback, the release of 20 living hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, and the freeing of approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners by Israel. Following this, hundreds of aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza to address the humanitarian crisis. Subsequent phases of the plan, which are yet to be negotiated, will address complex issues like the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza.</p>

The acquiring company was founded by Scott Leiendecker, a former Republican election official from Missouri. Following years of defending its reputation through high-profile defamation lawsuits, including a landmark settlement with Fox, the sale marks a new chapter for the election technology provider.

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has accepted paid advisory positions with technology giant Microsoft and artificial intelligence startup Anthropic. An independent watchdog committee has stipulated that he cannot lobby government ministers on behalf of the companies for two years. Sunak, who prioritized tech regulation during his premiership, stated he will donate his earnings from these roles to a charity he founded. This move follows speculation about his post-political career, as he has strong ties to California's Silicon Valley.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced its annual inflation adjustments for the 2026 tax year, raising the income thresholds for all federal tax brackets. For returns filed in 2027, the top 37% tax rate will apply to individuals with taxable income over $640,600. The standard deduction will also increase, rising to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly. These routine adjustments are designed to account for inflation and prevent "bracket creep," where taxpayers are pushed into higher tax brackets without a real increase in purchasing power.

          <p>This article presents a personal essay on the experience of learning English as a second language and the profound impact it has on one's identity. The author recounts their journey from being forced to learn English in Spain to fully immersing themselves in the language and culture in the United States. The piece reflects on the challenges and rewards of linguistic duality, exploring how mastering another language opens up new ways of thinking, writing, and even falling in love. It celebrates the odyssey of stepping outside one's mother tongue to discover a new version of oneself.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur and private astronaut Jared Isaacman to again discuss nominating him to lead NASA. This comes months after Trump publicly pulled Isaacman's initial nomination, citing his status as a Democrat and his close ties to SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The renewed talks suggest a potential thaw in the relationship between Trump and Musk, and a second chance for Isaacman to lead the space agency. Isaacman, founder of Shift4, has led two private spaceflights with SpaceX.</p>

          <p>In a stunning comeback, South Africa defeated co-hosts India by three wickets at the Women's Cricket World Cup, thanks to a remarkable performance by Nadine de Klerk. De Klerk scored an unbeaten 84 from just 54 balls, hitting the winning six to chase down India's total of 251 with seven balls to spare. The victory was crucial for South Africa, who had slipped to 81-5 before a recovery led by captain Laura Wolvaardt and Chloe Tryon set the stage for De Klerk's heroics. The result marks India's first defeat of the tournament and keeps South Africa's semi-final hopes alive.</p>

          <p>In a surprising development, the U.S. Department of Education is sending notices to some student loan borrowers informing them that their debt is eligible for cancellation, despite the ongoing government shutdown. The forgiveness applies to borrowers who have reached the required number of payments under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. This action follows a temporary pause on IBR discharges that had caused concern among borrowers who have been in repayment for over two decades. The move could provide significant financial relief to thousands of individuals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans have fallen to their lowest levels since 2023, making it a more affordable time for homeowners to tap into their property's value. The decline follows the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, though future cuts are not guaranteed. Compared to high-interest options like credit cards, home equity borrowing remains a significantly cheaper alternative for financing major expenses or consolidating debt. With homeowner equity levels remaining strong, many are in a good position to leverage this asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a practical breakdown of the monthly costs associated with a $90,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) at today's lower interest rates. For a 10-year repayment period, the monthly payment is approximately $1,084, while a 15-year term would be around $852. These costs are notably lower than they were earlier in the year due to a cooling rate environment. The article also compares the variable-rate HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, helping homeowners weigh the predictability of fixed payments against the potential for further rate drops.

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued a stay of execution for Robert Roberson just one week before he was scheduled to be put to death. Roberson was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002 based on a diagnosis of "shaken baby syndrome." His legal team has long argued his innocence, presenting new expert testimony suggesting the child died from pneumonia, not abuse. The court's ruling allows for a review of his case under a Texas law that permits challenges to convictions based on discredited or outdated scientific evidence.</p>
