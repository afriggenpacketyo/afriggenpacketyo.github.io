          <p>Johnny Rodriguez, the first Mexican American country music star known for his 1970s hits like ‚ÄúRidin‚Äô My Thumb to Mexico,‚Äù passed away at 73. Rodriguez rose to fame in the 1970s, achieving six No. 1 singles on Billboard‚Äôs Hot Country Songs chart. In 1999, Rodriguez was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of an acquaintance, claiming self-defense under Texas law. The article also notes his advice to young artists: to write their own material to stand out and be honest about their experiences.</p>

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, an L.A.-based company, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items from businesses in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington due to a listeria outbreak first identified in 2024.

While no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food, the company is taking precautionary measures.

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order directing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other countries. This "most favored nation" policy aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but it is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. A similar effort during Trump's first term was blocked by court orders citing procedural issues. The proposal would likely impact drugs administered in doctor's offices, such as infusions and injectables, and would not cover common prescription drugs filled at a pharmacy.</p>

Democratic lawmakers have blasted the plan as potentially illegal and a form of corruption.

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to stop offering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss is forcing many Americans to switch to a less effective drug. This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, blocks patients from accessing competing treatments. While Zepbound has shown better weight loss results, Caremark claims the move will lower drug prices for employers. Patients and doctors are expressing concerns about the disruption to treatment and the limited ability to tailor drug prescriptions to individual needs.</p>

          <h2>Weight Loss Drugs Compared in Head-to-Head Trial, Clear Winner Emerges</h2>

          <p>A head-to-head trial of two popular weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Wegovy, has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial showed that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks, compared to 14% with Wegovy. While both drugs resulted in substantial weight loss and had similar side effects, Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those with more weight to lose. Experts suggest that both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be preferred for individuals seeking maximum weight loss.</p>
