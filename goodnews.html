          <p>Scotland manager Steve Clarke expressed profound disappointment with his team's 'lacklustre' performance despite securing a 2-1 victory over Belarus, which assured them of at least a play-off place for the World Cup. Midfielder John McGinn described Clarke as the 'wildest' he'd seen in 72 games during a furious half-time team talk. While the win ensures maximum points from the international camp, there was palpable frustration among fans and players over the team's subdued play. Clarke acknowledged the positive result but questioned the team's poor showing, especially after a similarly 'wretched' performance against Greece. The article highlights the high expectations for the squad and the manager's commitment to improving their game ahead of crucial qualifiers. Despite the anger, the team remains in a strong position for qualification.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays, has sparked public debate in Germany. While tabloids sensationalized the news as 'extra holidays' for Muslims, legal and Islamic scholars, along with the Ministry of Education, clarified that the agreement merely formalizes existing legal practice rooted in religious freedom. This provision aligns with the state's Sunday and Holiday Act, allowing leave without pay, similar to allowances for other non-Christian religious communities.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, drawing on studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, identifies seven toxic habits that prevent children from developing mental strength. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing big feelings, prizing achievement above all, hoarding power, making kids responsible for parental emotions, and glorifying burnout. Instead, the article advocates for allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, apologizing for parental mistakes, validating their emotions, and emphasizing effort over outcomes. It also stresses the importance of giving children a voice in decisions, managing one's own emotional regulation, and demonstrating the value of rest. The article suggests that mental strength is built through helping children navigate difficulties, feel their emotions, take ownership, and prioritize self-care while feeling unconditionally loved.
