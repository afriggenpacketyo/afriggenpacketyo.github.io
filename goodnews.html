          <p>TikTok is launching an in-app meditation feature aimed at promoting wellness and addressing concerns about the app's impact on users' mental health, particularly among children. The guided meditation exercises are designed to improve sleep quality and will be prompted during "sleep hours" for users under 18. This initiative follows a series of lawsuits and public pressure regarding the platform's potential addictive nature and psychological risks to young users, including depression, anxiety, and body dysmorphia. The feature is part of a broader effort by TikTok to introduce healthier digital habits and enhance parental controls.</p>

          <p>China conveyed a clear message to the U.S. during trade discussions held in Geneva: resolving concerns with the world trading system requires a multilateral approach. By hosting the meetings at the residence of Switzerland's UN ambassador, China signaled that the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Geneva should be the central forum for addressing trade issues. While headline tariffs were reduced, these adjustments primarily corrected measures that were non-compliant with WTO rules, reinforcing China's commitment to multilateralism in trade.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected sales for its fiscal fourth quarter, driven by strong demand for jewelry from affluent consumers. The company's Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, experienced double-digit growth, offsetting declines in its specialist watchmakers segment. While sales in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) declined due to weakness in China, overall full-year sales rose 4%, surpassing analyst expectations. Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require continued agility and discipline, but the company's pricing power is expected to mitigate some headwinds. </p>

          <p>The article explains the phenomenon of "mud balls" in golf, which occur when golf balls become covered in mud and dirt during adverse weather conditions, significantly affecting their flight and trajectory. Unlike regular tournaments where preferred lies allow players to clean their balls, major championships like the PGA often leave the decision to implement this rule to tournament organizers. This can lead to unpredictable spins and challenges for golfers, adding an element of chance to the game depending on weather conditions.</p>
