          <p>Japan's economy experienced a 0.2% contraction in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with the annualized GDP contracting by 0.7%. Despite these concerns, domestic demand showed a 'bright spot' with 0.6% growth. The Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current rate of 0.5% and is closely monitoring the impact of global trade policies, particularly those of the U.S., on Japan's economic outlook.

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is not adequately prepared for the upcoming hurricane season, which begins on June 1. Acting FEMA Administrator David Richardson stated that the agency is about 80-85% prepared and aims to close the gap soon. Staffing limitations, hiring issues, and a lack of coordination with states are cited as factors impacting FEMA's readiness. The agency intends to prioritize safeguarding the American people, strengthening state response capabilities, and coordinating federal assistance when necessary, reflecting a shift towards a smaller federal footprint.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting a photo of seashells spelling "8647" on social media, which some Republicans interpreted as a threat against President Donald Trump.

Trump is the 47th US president. Comey deleted the post and claimed he did not intend to incite violence.

          <p>Organizers of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympics are exploring the possibility of providing an air taxi service for spectators in partnership with Archer Aviation. The service aims to use electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to transport fans to and from venues, potentially reducing travel times to 10-20 minutes. Archer Aviation is currently seeking certification from the FAA, and hopes to have prices comparable to high-end Uber services. If approved, the air taxis could offer a new mode of transportation for residents and visitors during the Games, but safety, regulations, and investment remain significant hurdles.</p>

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season faces disruption due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in fishing ropes, leading to maiming or death. Fisherman Brand Little uses a high-tech, remote-controlled pop-up system to retrieve crab cages with minimal rope, allowing him to fish when others cannot. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) shortened the season to protect whales, but the pop-up technology offers a potential solution. The technology is an experiment sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which is tasked with regulating the crab fishing season.</p>

          <p>Former Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley has criticized President Donald Trump's acceptance of a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, reportedly valued at $400 million, from Qatar, raising concerns about national security. Haley highlighted Qatar's ties to terrorist organizations and suggested that accepting such gifts could imply the President and the U.S. can be bought. Trump defended the arrangement, stating the aircraft would be given to the U.S. Air Force and would serve as a temporary Air Force One. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman questioned the inconsistency of criticizing this while universities accept billions from Qatar, highlighting national security implications in both practices.</p>

He cited discrepancies in a video released by Blue Origin, including the astronauts' seemingly unaffected hair and a pre-opened key upon landing. Several celebrities attended the event last month, including Oprah, a close friend of King's. The mission spanned 10 minutes and 21 seconds.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, when a land bridge connected the two continents. Among the studied fossils are Dalianensis horses, named after the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian, near where they were unearthed, who lived 17,000 years ago and were slightly bigger than existing wild horses. The study found that horses undertook multiple migrations across the Bering land bridge between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with genetic exchanges between North America and Eurasia in both directions.</p>

          <p>A military parade to mark the Army's 250th anniversary next month, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles, thousands of soldiers, and potentially 50 helicopters. The event will take place on June 14, the same day as Mr. Trump's 79th birthday. The plans have drawn some criticism from Democrats, with Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee calling the plan wasteful.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Lift Syria Sanctions Took Treasury Staff by Surprise</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift all sanctions on Syria surprised senior officials at the Treasury Department, which administers and enforces sanctions policy. The announcement was short on specifics, including which measures would be rolled back and at what pace. Syria's transitional government has been pushing the Trump administration for sanctions relief in recent months. Some of the most punitive measures were imposed over the last two decades on the former regime of Bashar al-Assad for human rights abuses and support for groups designated by the U.S. as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are facing financial instability due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods. Business owner Bobby Djavaheri, who imports kitchen appliances from China, experienced a 145% tariff hike, followed by a reduction to 30%, creating significant financial whiplash. The situation leaves many U.S. businesses facing a dilemma: They can either pay more to ship at the current 30% tariff rate on China, or wait in the hope that the Trump administration will lower the tariffs further. The duties are a huge outlay of cash that these businesses are facing.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate an assisted dying bill again after major changes. The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November ‚Äì but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides. A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. Friday's debate comes as the government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>

The cases before the court involve the president‚Äôs blatantly unconstitutional order to eliminate birthright citizenship in the United States.</p>
