          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest and heaviest rocket ever constructed, achieved a critical near-flawless test flight, with both stages successfully splashing down nearly intact. This significant milestone revives NASA's hopes for its Artemis III mission, which plans to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2027 using Starship's lunar lander variant. However, experts warn that China's rapid advancements in space exploration, including its own lunar base ambitions, could still lead them to win the broader lunar prize. NASA's acting administrator has expressed strong confidence in winning this renewed space race, highlighting the national importance of lunar dominance and technological leadership.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced plans to formally request that the United States share the $15 billion forfeited by convicted drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada with Mexico's poorest citizens. Zambada, a co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa cartel, pleaded guilty in a New York court to murder and extensive drug trafficking, including fentanyl, agreeing to forfeit the vast sum to avoid the death penalty. While his conviction marks a significant blow, Mexican security officials caution that the cartel itself remains far from finished. This request underscores a desire to redirect illicit gains towards addressing deep-seated poverty and social issues in Mexico.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the initial electric vehicle (EV) models qualifying for a substantial £3,750 discount under a new government grant scheme. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier are among the first to receive the largest reduction, applicable to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000, with 26 other models receiving a £1,500 discount. This initiative, backed by a £650 million scheme over three years, aims to significantly lower EV upfront costs and encourage drivers to transition from petrol and diesel cars. The policy addresses a key barrier to EV adoption and aligns with the government's 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales, despite ongoing concerns about charging infrastructure availability.</p>

          <p>Amtrak has officially launched its NextGen Acela trains, promising faster service with top speeds of 160 mph and enhanced passenger amenities along the busy Northeast corridor between Washington, D.C., and Boston. These new trains, contracted with French manufacturer Alstom, will replace current Acela equipment, accommodating 27% more customers and offering features like wider seats and free high-speed Wi-Fi. Despite facing years of delays and recent financial challenges for Amtrak, including executive turnover, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy lauded the launch as a significant advancement for American high-speed rail. The initiative aims to modernize US rail travel, though its speeds still trail those of international counterparts.</p>

          <p>The Welsh government is proposing adjustments to its controversial tax rules for owners of self-catering holiday accommodation, aiming to alleviate financial pressures on businesses. Current regulations, implemented in 2023, mandate properties be available for 252 days and let for 182 days annually to qualify for lower non-domestic rates. The new proposal suggests utilizing a multi-year average for the 182-day letting target and allowing up to 14 days of charitable holidays to count towards the threshold. Despite the government's claim of listening to feedback, industry groups and opposition parties criticize these changes as insufficient, arguing the 182-day rule continues to harm the tourism sector and requires a more substantial reduction.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Los Angeles Needs Legislation to Combat Illegal Short-Term Rentals and Boost Tax Revenue</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Los Angeles is currently forfeiting millions in crucial tax revenue due to the proliferation of illegal short-term rentals, which are simultaneously worsening the city's housing crisis. With major international events like the World Cup and Olympics on the horizon, the city anticipates a surge in rental demand but lacks essential data from platforms like Airbnb to effectively enforce existing regulations. State bill SB 346, presently undergoing legislative review, aims to mandate data sharing from these rental platforms, thereby enabling cities to identify and penalize unlicensed properties and collect overdue taxes. The author, an L.A. councilmember, stresses the critical importance of this measure to fund vital public services amidst budget deficits and federal funding cuts.</p>

          <p>Chuck E. Cheese has made a strategic move into the "kidult" market with the launch of "Chuck's Arcade," its inaugural California location specifically tailored for adults who grew up with arcade games. The expansive 3,600-square-foot venue boasts 70 games, including beloved retro classics such as "Tron" and "Ms. Pac-Man," and features a darker, nostalgic aesthetic reminiscent of 80s and 90s arcades. Distinct from its traditional family-focused establishments, this new concept deliberately omits pizza and alcohol, positioning itself as a dedicated arcade destination strategically located near mall food courts to attract broader foot traffic. While aiming for a strong sense of nostalgia and targeting collectors with claw machines, the article suggests this venture represents a somewhat tentative step into the adult entertainment space, implying a more robust offering might be needed for its intended grown-up audience.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom firmly asserts that the fundamental challenge confronting the Democratic Party is its perceived "weakness," which underpins his increasingly combative and attention-grabbing political tactics. These include publicly mocking President Trump on social media and engaging in interviews with right-wing influencers. Newsom believes Democrats must actively break free from merely reacting to conservative narratives and instead proactively establish their own agenda, referencing former President Clinton's observation that voters often prefer "strong and wrong to weak and right." His actions, such as vigorously pushing for a redistricting measure in California designed to secure more House seats, are integral to a broader strategy aimed at projecting Democratic strength and effectively countering the far-right agenda, particularly as he considers a potential 2028 presidential bid.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Exceeds Earnings and Revenue Expectations, But Stock Dips on Data Center Miss</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales growth projected to remain above 50%, signaling a robust and sustained demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. However, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading as its data center revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. Nvidia anticipates an impressive $3-4 trillion in global AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. The company's growth is predominantly fueled by its data center business, particularly its high-performance GPU chips, despite navigating complex challenges related to H20 chip shipments to China due to geopolitical factors. The board also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases. (not investment advice)</p>
