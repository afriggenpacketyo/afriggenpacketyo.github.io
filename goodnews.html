          <p>China has taken a significant step in its nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. This gigawatt-level facility, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to be operational after 2030. The development places China among other major nuclear powers like Russia and the U.S. that are also pursuing advanced reactor technologies. These next-generation reactors aim to provide a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of power, marking a key milestone for the country's energy future.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge fund sector is capitalizing on challenges faced by Chinese PhD students in the United States, such as funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are actively recruiting this top-tier talent, offering competitive salaries to bolster their capabilities in artificial intelligence and support expansion. This brain drain from the US is helping to fuel the rapid growth of China's quant sector, which operates in the world's second-largest yuan-denominated market. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for scientific and engineering expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges, admitting he used a fabricated biography to defraud voters and donors for his own enrichment. The funds were spent on luxury goods, Botox, and other personal expenses. After his sentencing, Santos appealed to President Trump for a future chance, but the case marks the final chapter in the rapid political rise and fall of the expelled House member.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is facing a crucial hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. The conflict began when Rebecca Dowdeswell tried to re-register the trademark for her business, "nkd," which L'Oréal opposed, citing potential consumer confusion with its "Naked" product line. Dowdeswell, who has spent over £30,000 in legal fees, argues there has never been any confusion in her 15 years of trading. Despite the stress, she feels ready to fight, believing the large corporation expects her to give up.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. An abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, has been a key factor, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. Butterfly conservationists also report an extraordinary year for early sightings, a stark contrast to the previous year's low numbers. However, the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year, and the long-term trend for flying insects remains one of decline.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were illegal and thwarted enforcement efforts. In her ruling, the judge stated the policies do not improperly regulate federal operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, affirming their commitment to policies they say support public safety by focusing local police on local needs.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a critical mission to rescue the state's desert bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, experts captured dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd. These animals were airlifted, checked by veterinarians, and relocated to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, healthy colony. A recent visit revealed the effort is succeeding, with the relocated herd surviving and even producing new lambs, offering hope for the species' future.</p>

          <p>This article explores the validity of popular health benchmarks, such as drinking eight glasses of water, getting eight hours of sleep, and walking 10,000 steps daily. Experts suggest that while these targets are useful guidelines, there is often room for flexibility based on individual needs and lifestyles. For instance, thirst is a reliable indicator for hydration for most healthy people, but the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep is less negotiable for long-term health. The consensus is that while benchmarks are helpful, a balanced, consistent approach to overall well-being is more important than rigidly hitting every number.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is taking place in women's sport, moving away from treating female athletes as "mini-men." Researchers are now studying the unique ways elite sport affects the female body, from how breast biomechanics and proper sports bras can impact running stride to the potential influence of the menstrual cycle on performance. The article also delves into why female athletes have a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and how anatomy, hormones, and quality of training all play a role. This growing body of research is improving performance and helping to keep more women engaged in sports.</p>
