          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserted that the UK has secured the best trade deals with the US, EU, and India, positioning Britain as a prime location for investment and business. Reeves highlighted recent agreements, including a deal with the EU that she described as the best for any country outside the bloc, and hinted at upgraded economic growth forecasts due to these deals. However, opposition parties have criticized the government for concessions made in these trade agreements, while Reeves mentioned a future deal with Gulf nations, signaling continued trade expansion efforts.

          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian resident of Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, has been arrested in Japan after allegedly driving his car the wrong way on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture, causing a collision with multiple vehicles. The man is accused of failing to report the accident after hitting two vehicles, though he has only admitted to colliding with one. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to four women. Police suspect the man made an illegal U-turn on the expressway and continued driving the wrong way for about 10 kilometers before stopping.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, surged over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's potential to capitalize on the electric vehicle (EV) boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the funds to construct a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. While CATL faces increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, its primary focus remains on markets like Europe and emerging regions.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing trade war initiated by US President Donald Trump, China experienced a net capital inflow of $17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and a Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. Analysts attribute this trend to a shift away from US dollar assets since the trade war began, highlighting changing global investment dynamics.</p>
