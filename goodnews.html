          <p>JPMorgan Chase will strategically engage with stablecoins to understand the technology and counter threats from fintech competitors, CEO Jamie Dimon announced. Despite his personal skepticism about their utility compared to traditional payments, Dimon acknowledged the necessity of being involved as rivals attempt to innovate in the financial space. This follows similar explorations by other major banks like Citigroup, which is also actively examining the issuance of its own stablecoin and opportunities in asset tokenization.

          <p>A new Pew Research Centre survey indicates that public opinion towards China has become more positive in several Latin American countries, including Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. This growing favorability in the region stands in contrast to the overwhelmingly negative views of China held in many wealthier, high-income nations. Despite this trend, the survey also found that many people in Latin America continue to view the United States as their most important economic partner, highlighting a complex and evolving geopolitical dynamic.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the U.S. has secured a trade deal with Indonesia, just a week after threatening the country with a 32% tariff on its exports. In a social media post, Trump called it a "great deal, for everybody" but provided no immediate details, stating they would be released later. This follows a similar pattern to a recent announcement about a deal with Vietnam, where specifics were slow to emerge and were not fully confirmed by the other party.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy reversal, President Donald Trump announced an agreement with NATO allies to facilitate large-scale arms deliveries, including Patriot missiles, to Ukraine. Trump stated the weapons would be paid for by European allies and warned Russia of severe secondary sanctions and 100% tariffs if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This move marks a dramatic change from his administration's previous skepticism about U.S. involvement, with Trump now praising European resolve.</p>
