          <h2>Cryptocurrency Market Rises Amid Optimism for US Stablecoin Legislation</h2>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a rebound as investor optimism grew regarding the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation in the U.S. House this week. Bitcoin and ether prices increased, along with stocks of related companies like Coinbase and Circle, despite a recent legislative setback. Analysts suggest the passage of the GENIUS and CLARITY acts is a matter of "when," not "if," which has calmed market fears. This legislative push aims to regulate stablecoin issuers and could reinforce Ethereum's role in the ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of America announced mixed financial results for the second quarter, beating earnings per share estimates but missing revenue expectations. The bank's profit saw a modest climb, but its revenue was hampered by net interest income (NII) that fell slightly below analyst predictions. CEO Brian Moynihan highlighted resilient consumer spending and positive momentum in the bank's markets businesses, noting four consecutive quarters of NII growth. However, the miss on this key metric indicates challenges from lower interest rates compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time in history, the Major League Baseball All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie. The National League secured the victory after Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs on three swings, overcoming a deficit. The American League failed to match the total in their final attempts, concluding the game with the novel tie-breaking procedure. This new rule, introduced in 2022 to avoid exhausting pitching staffs, provided a dramatic and memorable ending to the midsummer classic, with Schwarber earning the MVP award.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted a five-year ban on airlines from Pakistan, allowing them to apply for the resumption of flights after determining significant improvements in aviation safety standards. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which came to light after a deadly Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. This decision follows a similar move by the European Union earlier this year and is expected to provide a major revenue boost for PIA. The restoration of key international routes comes as Pakistan proceeds with plans to privatize its national carrier.</p>

          <p>China is expanding its efforts to promote the global use of its currency, the yuan, with Africa serving as a key testing ground. The central banks of China and Egypt recently signed agreements to facilitate the use of the yuan in trade, investment, and electronic payments. This includes integrating with China's Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), an alternative to the SWIFT network. Egypt is the latest African nation, alongside others like South Africa and Nigeria, to establish yuan-based financial arrangements with Beijing, signaling a strategic move to increase the currency's international footprint.</p>

          <p>Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin stated his focus is on re-earning voter trust ahead of the midterm elections by engaging communities directly and highlighting the negative impacts of President Trump's policies. Martin is leading an "organizing summer" initiative to connect with voters and build relationships outside of election cycles. The party's strategy will center on Trump's unpopular spending bill, framing it as a threat to healthcare, food security, and jobs. Martin acknowledged internal party divisions but insisted his main goal is unifying Democrats to counter the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that while the home run swing-off was an exciting innovation, Major League Baseball must do more to revitalize its All-Star Game. The author suggests introducing a bat-flip competition into the Home Run Derby to generate social media buzz and attract younger fans. The article also criticizes the high number of star players who withdraw from the game, proposing a schedule change to encourage participation. To make the game itself more compelling, the author advocates for returning to a model where top players play more innings, rather than ensuring every All-Star gets a brief appearance.</p>

          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported that a recent strengthening of the Japanese yen has curbed the tourist-driven spending boom in Japan. The company's sales in Japan fell 15% in the first fiscal quarter, a sharp reversal from the 59% jump seen in the same period last year when a weaker yen attracted a flood of shoppers, particularly from China. Despite the decline in Japan, Richemont's overall sales grew 6%, slightly beating analyst expectations, largely due to strong performance in its high-end jewelry division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels.

          <p>China's implementation of new visa-free travel policies has led to a significant increase in foreign visitors during the first half of 2025. According to the country's immigration administration, foreign nationals made 38 million trips in and out of China, marking a 30% year-on-year increase. An official spokesperson stated that the visa facilitation measures have been effective in attracting foreign visitors for both tourism and business, which in turn is driving growth in domestic consumption.

The deal follows a series of trade talks initiated after the White House threatened dozens of countries with high tariffs. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto described the pact as a "new era of mutual benefit," while acknowledging Trump as a tough negotiator.</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blackstone has been significantly expanding its portfolio of U.S. rental housing, acquiring apartment complexes, student housing, and single-family rental properties. The firm's strategy focuses on markets with strong job and population growth, particularly in major cities and Sun Belt states like Texas, Georgia, and Florida. While Blackstone owns less than 1% of the nation's rental homes, its recent multi-billion dollar acquisitions, including Tricon Residential and AIR Communities, position it to benefit from current market dynamics. Experts note that buying existing properties is often cheaper than building new ones, which supports rent growth and limits new construction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Miley Cyrus has revealed she has "no desire" to go on a major tour, citing the difficulty of maintaining her sobriety and mental health while on the road. Speaking just weeks after releasing her ninth album, Cyrus explained that she feels there is a lack of adequate support for artists during the intense touring process. It has been over a decade since her last major tour in 2014, and while some fans expressed disappointment, they also showed support for her prioritizing her well-being.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are studying the factors that contribute to healthy brain aging to help counter the normal cognitive decline that begins around age 40. A large-scale online study called MindCrowd has identified "exceptional" performers whose brains function like those of people 30 years younger. Early results suggest that key lifestyle factors for preserving memory and processing speed include getting high-quality sleep, maintaining cardiovascular health, avoiding smoking, and getting regular exercise. Scientists emphasize that understanding the mechanisms of brain aging is crucial for developing strategies to preserve cognitive function throughout life and distinguish it from diseases like Alzheimer's.</p>
