          <p>Veteran supermodel David Gandy has joined over 2,000 other models in calling for UK government regulation of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He warns that AI-generated models, which are already being used in campaigns, pose an existential threat by making human models, photographers, and makeup artists redundant. Gandy, who rose to fame as the face of Dolce & Gabbana's Light Blue fragrance, expresses concern that this trend undermines the artistry of fashion photography. He also worries about the mental health impact on young people who may aspire to unrealistic, non-human beauty standards.</p>

          <p>British sculptor Martin Jennings has been selected to create the statue for the national memorial to Queen Elizabeth II, which will be located in St James's Park in London. Jennings, known for his depictions of King Charles III and the Queen Mother, stated his intention is to capture the "grandeur and dignity" of the late monarch. The final design for the statue and the surrounding memorial, which will also honor Prince Philip, is set to be revealed in 2026. Jennings plans to consult with the Royal Family and listen to public sentiment to ensure the representation is fitting for the widely admired queen.</p>

          <p>A recent flurry of significant investment pledges from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is bolstering the UK's ambition to become an AI superpower. Microsoft announced a £22 billion investment, while Google is expanding its data center infrastructure with a £5 billion commitment, signaling strong confidence in the British tech sector. This "UK-tech bromance" aligns with the current administration's pro-growth approach to technology, which contrasts with previous regulatory scrutiny. While some critics worry about over-reliance on "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," the influx of capital is seen as a major boost for the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy, while promoting his new film "Steve," has reflected on his long-running role as Tommy Shelby in "Peaky Blinders," calling it a "defining" privilege. A film continuation of the popular series is set to be released by Netflix, though Murphy remained tight-lipped about the plot. He emphasized that he is nothing like the "psychopathic gangster" he portrayed for six seasons. His new film, "Steve," sees him play a headteacher at a 1990s reform school, a role he describes as part of a "love letter to teachers" and their role as custodians of the next generation.</p>

          <p>Nearly 200 people completed a 14-day, 160-mile march from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C., to advocate for democratic principles and accountability from leaders. The "We Are America" marchers, ranging from children to the elderly, were greeted by supporters and members of Congress upon their arrival. The demonstration was organized in response to actions by the Trump administration, with participants aiming to build a community for sustained nonviolent action. Along their journey through multiple states, the marchers were supported by local communities who provided food, water, and shelter, reinforcing their sense of shared purpose.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a comprehensive package of climate and energy bills designed as a compromise to advance California's clean-energy goals while addressing economic concerns. The legislation extends the state's cap-and-trade program to 2045, directing billions toward lowering utility bills and funding public transit. A controversial component of the package, SB 237, allows for up to 2,000 new oil wells per year in Kern County until 2036, a move criticized by some environmentalists. The package also aims to stabilize volatile gas prices by allowing the governor to suspend certain fuel standards during price spikes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has thrown out President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the 85-page complaint was "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the filing for its "abundant, florid, and enervating detail" that went far beyond the legal requirement for a "simple, concise and direct" statement of the case. The President's legal team has been given 28 days to file a shorter, amended complaint with a 40-page limit. The lawsuit targets the newspaper and four of its reporters over their extensive coverage of his career and presidency.</p>
