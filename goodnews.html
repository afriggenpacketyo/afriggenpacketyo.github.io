          <p>According to Vice President JD Vance, former President Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to the Middle East to personally greet Israeli hostages upon their release by Hamas. The release, described by Vance as a "monumental thing," is part of the initial phase of a peace agreement and is expected to occur imminently. Vance highlighted this development as a success for non-traditional diplomatic approaches, contrasting with what he termed previously failed routes. He also expressed doubt that Israel would be able to retrieve the remains of all deceased hostages from the Gaza-based group.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Denver Broncos defeated the New York Jets 13-11 in a game played in London, largely due to an overpowering defensive performance. The Broncos' defense held the Jets' offense to just 82 total yards and recorded nine sacks on quarterback Justin Fields. Denver's offense was led by Bo Nix, whose first-quarter 16-yard touchdown pass proved to be the decisive score in the low-scoring contest. This win improves the Broncos' season record to 4-2, while the Jets remain winless at 0-6.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has stated that Germany is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza and is proposing to co-host a reconstruction conference with Egypt. Wadephul emphasized that such a conference must be politically broad, include Israel, and aim for a long-term two-state solution under a United Nations mandate. This initiative has received support from Germany's ruling coalition, which views aiding Gaza's reconstruction as important for humanitarian, security, and migration policy reasons. However, the proposal has faced initial criticism from Israel's foreign minister regarding a separate, related meeting in Paris.</p>

          <p>In a prologue from his new memoir, "Life, Law & Liberty," retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy reflects on how his upbringing in Sacramento, California, shaped his judicial philosophy. He describes the American West as a place that, despite its imperfections, instilled in him a belief in individual liberty, tolerance, and community. Kennedy explains that these core values guided his thinking on the nation's founding principles throughout his long tenure on the bench. The excerpt sets the stage for a personal account of his journey from a local lawyer to one of the most influential figures on the nation's highest court.</p>
