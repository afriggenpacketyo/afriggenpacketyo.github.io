The judge ruled that the FOMC is not a government agency under the act's purview and questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying the country's airlines about their future needs for Boeing commercial jets, a move that suggests a potential thaw in trade relations with the U.S. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) specifically asked carriers about overdue Boeing orders and their fleet renewal plans for 2025 and beyond. This development, along with a recent meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing executive, hints that the American aerospace company could benefit if broader trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing prove successful.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "4% rule," a long-standing guideline for retirees to determine a safe annual withdrawal rate from their savings. The rule suggests withdrawing 4% of a portfolio in the first year of retirement, then adjusting for inflation annually, to make savings last approximately 30 years. When applied to annuities, the rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential portfolio withdrawals. The article explores how this comparison helps retirees evaluate trade-offs between liquidity, inflation protection, and longevity risk. (not investment advice)</p>
