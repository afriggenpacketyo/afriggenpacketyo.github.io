          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, former President Donald Trump shared ten key takeaways in an exclusive interview, rating the meeting a "10" for rapport. He stated that while significant progress was made, there is "no deal until there's a deal," placing the onus on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European nations to finalize any agreement. Trump also reiterated his belief that the war in Ukraine would not have occurred under his presidency and advised Zelenskyy to "make a deal" to end the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department following a legal challenge from the city. Under the revised arrangement, Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, contrary to an initial order that would have placed a DEA administrator in charge. The agreement, reached after a judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the move, still allows the administration to direct the police for certain federal purposes, including immigration enforcement, which remains a point of contention.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first for-sale accessory dwelling unit (ADU), also known as a granny flat, which can be sold as a condominium separate from the main home on the property. This development comes a year after the city adopted a pioneering law to allow such sales, aiming to create a new, more affordable path to homeownership. As ADU construction booms across the state, officials hope this model will be replicated by other cities to help address California's severe housing shortage by providing more starter homes.</p>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea accounts for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. This challenges the long-held assumption that the lakebed is the primary cause of the region's severe air quality issues and high asthma rates. Researchers suggest that pollution sources are more varied, including agriculture and traffic, and recommend shifting focus from shoreline dust control to protecting residents through improved indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may actually improve metabolic health when consumed in moderation. Two clinical trials found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with a controlled portion of mango led to better glycemic responses and improvements in key health markers for adults with type 2 diabetes. Researchers emphasize that this is not a license for unlimited consumption, but indicates that mangoes can be part of a balanced diet under clinical supervision without adversely affecting blood sugar levels.</p>

          <p>An iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant celebrating has been altered for a new mural in Redondo Beach, showing the Lakers legend wearing a Dodgers jersey instead of his usual purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger tribute to the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship on the side of a future restaurant. The artist explained the change was made to fit the mural's theme while still honoring Bryant's "Mamba mentality," a decision that has generated both positive feedback from fans of both teams and playful criticism from some Lakers purists.</p>

Late goals from Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah ultimately secured the win for the reigning champions on a night that also honored the late Diogo Jota with heartfelt gestures from players and fans.</p>

Their business model relies heavily on franchising, which fuels explosive growth but also presents challenges in maintaining quality control and avoiding market saturation.

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting its new electric pickup truck as a highly affordable, American-made EV, with a business model focused on simplicity and customization. The base model is a spare, two-seat vehicle that owners can modify with over 100 planned accessories or third-party add-ons. The company's main selling point is its low price, which it claims will remain competitive even after federal EV tax credits expire. However, analysts question if the barebones truck can compete with similarly priced conventional vehicles that offer more standard features. (not investment advice)</p>
