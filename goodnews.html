          <p>Redshirt freshman walk-on King Miller delivered a breakout performance, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown, to lead USC to a decisive 31-13 win against No. 15 Michigan. Miller, previously buried on the depth chart, stepped up spectacularly after both top running backs left with injuries, making electrifying runs that broke open the game. This resounding victory is a significant rebound for the Trojans, who had played poorly two weeks prior, and marks an important achievement for coach Lincoln Riley against ranked opponents. Furthermore, USC's defense showcased marked improvement, effectively stifling Michigan's top rushing attack and limiting their standout freshman quarterback. The impressive collective effort resulted in a pivotal statement win for the program, highlighting Miller's unexpected rise.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers secured their first postseason series win since 2018, defeating the Chicago Cubs 3-1 in the decisive fifth game of their NL Division Series. Key two-out home runs from Andrew Vaughn, William Contreras, and Brice Turang accounted for all of Milwaukee's runs, showcasing their clutch hitting. The Brewers utilized an effective all-hands-on-deck pitching strategy, with multiple relievers combining to hold the Cubs to just four hits and one run. This hard-fought victory, particularly gratifying against their biggest rival and former manager Craig Counsell, propels Milwaukee into an anticipated NL Championship Series showdown against the formidable Los Angeles Dodgers. The team's resilience and strategic play were central to their advancement.</p>

          <p>Following her passing, this article celebrates Diane Keaton's illustrious career by highlighting ten of her most important films, showcasing her diverse and influential body of work. From her Oscar-winning role as the quirky and iconic title character in Woody Allen's "Annie Hall," which profoundly defined her career and influenced fashion, to her powerful portrayal of Kay Adams Corleone in Francis Ford Coppola’s epic "The Godfather" trilogy, Keaton left an indelible mark on cinema. Other significant works include her tragic turn in the dark crime drama "Looking for Mr. Goodbar" and her acclaimed later performance in the romantic comedy "Something's Gotta Give." Her roles consistently demonstrated a unique blend of wit, vulnerability, and strength, cementing her legacy as a versatile and beloved cinematic icon who blazed a trail for women in film.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are intensely preparing for their NL Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, with manager Dave Roberts emphasizing the need for meticulous strategic preparation. Despite operating with a significantly lower payroll, the Brewers achieved a winning season by meticulously crafting a small-ball offense, excelling in getting on base, making contact, and aggressively stealing bases, rather than relying heavily on home runs. Their pitching staff, renowned for developing talent and replenishing depth on a shoestring budget, also boasts the league's second-best team ERA, anchored by veteran ace Freddy Peralta. The Dodgers were notably swept by Milwaukee in two series earlier this year, underscoring the significant challenges posed by the Brewers' impressive roster depth and their unique, cohesive playing style.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is currently undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of a treatment plan for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. He was diagnosed in May 2025 with a Gleason score of 9 (Grade Group 5), placing him in a high-risk category. A spokesperson confirmed that the former president is responding well to the treatment, which is being administered in Philadelphia. This follows a previous medical procedure in September 2025, when Biden underwent Mohs surgery for basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer. Prostate cancer is recognized as the second-most common cancer affecting men, with age being a primary risk factor. This article provides a comprehensive update on the former president's health and his ongoing medical care.</p>

Keaton, an Academy Award winner for her performance in "Annie Hall," was also notably romantically linked to co-stars and directors like Woody Allen and Warren Beatty. She famously never married, choosing instead to adopt two children in her 50s, a decision she attributed to finding her path after her father's death. Throughout her distinguished five-decade career, Keaton maintained a distinctive personal style and showcased remarkable versatility in her acting, leaving a profound and enduring legacy in cinema.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's significant struggles at the plate during the Dodgers' recent NL Division Series, where he managed only one hit in 18 at-bats with nine strikeouts, have raised considerable concerns for the team heading into the NL Championship Series. While Ohtani attributed some difficulty to facing numerous left-handed pitchers, manager Dave Roberts explicitly emphasized the urgent need for Ohtani to improve his "at-bat quality." Roberts called for less aggression outside the strike zone and more assertiveness within it, stating unequivocally that the Dodgers cannot win the World Series with such a performance. This highlights the critical importance of Ohtani's ability to recalibrate his approach and make necessary adjustments against opposing pitchers for the team's postseason success.</p>

          <p>Doncaster heavyweight David Allen faced a unanimous points defeat against Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at a raucous Sheffield Arena.

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on the last Sunday of October 2025, specifically at 02:00 BST, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, easily remembered by the phrase "spring forward, fall back," grants most people an extra hour. The practice, which began in Germany in 1916 during World War One to conserve fuel, has continued with ongoing debates about its permanent implementation. Arguments for year-round BST include potential economic boosts and a reduction in evening road accidents, but concerns persist about the impact of very gloomy winter mornings, particularly in Scotland, where sunrise could be as late as 9:45 AM, affecting commuters and schoolchildren.</p>

Her mother, Patsy, motivated by gratitude to medical professionals who treated her cancer, wants to contribute to the education of future doctors. Owen explored the process in a documentary, visiting Cardiff University's anatomy centre where donated bodies are used for teaching. The article details how students form connections with their "silent teachers" and how families adjust to the delayed funeral arrangements.

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses this autumn, with many individuals reporting particularly severe symptoms. Health experts explain that this phenomenon is normal for the season, as increased indoor gatherings and children returning to school create ideal conditions for various respiratory viruses to flourish. Data from the UK Health Security Agency indicates a significant rise in Rhinovirus, commonly known as the common cold, with Covid-19 and flu also actively circulating, though most Covid cases are mild due to high population immunity. While overall illness levels aren't exceptionally high, an earlier-than-expected uptick in flu among younger age groups has been noted. The article advises eligible individuals to get vaccinated for flu, Covid, and RSV, and to practice basic hygiene to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates an increasing number of people are turning to AI for holiday planning, from suggesting destinations to crafting itineraries. Alan Smith successfully used ChatGPT to find a perfect, less-touristy Spanish seaside town for his family, praising its efficiency over traditional search engines. However, the article also highlights AI's limitations, as Hannah Read discovered when ChatGPT falsely suggested a non-existent ferry route to Norway. While AI can streamline planning, experts like Alistair Berry caution users to fact-check recommendations, especially regarding ambitious itineraries, and understand that chatbots may be overly encouraging. This article explores both the benefits and pitfalls of using AI in travel.</p>
