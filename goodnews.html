          <p>Suriname initiated parliamentary elections to determine the government that will manage the nation's newfound oil wealth. The country faces challenges like high debt, inflation, and poverty, affecting nearly one-fifth of its 600,000 residents. Offshore crude discoveries offer the potential for economic transformation. Incumbent President Chan Santokhi seeks a mandate to utilize the anticipated income for the benefit of the Surinamese people, promising to improve living standards and ensure that everyone benefits from the nation's growth. The new parliament will select a president and vice-president to oversee this period of change.</p>

          <p>South Korea's upcoming presidential election is critical for restoring domestic stability and navigating complex geopolitics following former president Yoon Suk-yeol's impeachment. Society is divided, and the ruling People Power Party (PPP) has struggled to find a stable presidential candidate. Opposition Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in polls and has shifted towards the center, focusing on domestic priorities and pragmatic foreign policy. The new president must address economic concerns and manage South Korea's position in the midst of major power competition to ensure national security and long-term stability.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 17:19:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, "emotionally safe parenting" is a new framework that emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs. This approach prioritizes building emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations, setting clear boundaries with empathy, and encouraging independence. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without dismissing them, avoid shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. The goal is to create an environment where children feel safe expressing emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola defended his decision to leave out Jack Grealish, amidst speculation about Manchester City's squad changes. Kevin De Bruyne's departure marks the end of an era, while questions linger over the futures of several other players. Guardiola emphasized that new faces will arrive, particularly in weaker positions, but doesn't anticipate a major overhaul. The club's financial strength positions them well for spending this summer, though a move for Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz is unlikely due to cost.</p>

McLaren team boss Andrea Stella acknowledged the victory as a step forward. Max Verstappen and Red Bull attempted a strategy to gain the lead, but ultimately failed due to a lack of grip. Verstappen anticipates the Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya will better suit Red Bull, with fewer low-speed corners.</p>
