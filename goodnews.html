        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Caesar Sengupta, the co-founder and CEO of fintech startup Arta Finance, believes the most critical skill for entrepreneurs is the ability to ground themselves through meditation. Having raised over $92 million for his startup, which is backed by prominent figures like Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Sengupta advises founders to filter out the constant noise of the entrepreneurial world. The former Google executive, who led projects like Google Pay, explained that the startup journey is highly volatile and stressful. He stated that meditating for even a few minutes daily helps maintain mental health and focus amid the immense pressures of building a company.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has begun demolishing approximately 300 dams and shutting down hydropower stations along the Red River. This waterway is a crucial tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and is considered the last refuge for many rare and endemic fish species. Over decades, the dense network of dams has severely restricted water flow, blocking fish migration routes and damaging the ecosystem. This large-scale project aims to reverse the ecological degradation, reconnect migratory paths, and preserve the unique biodiversity of the region's aquatic life.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player via social media. The player is widely reported to be American and former NBA star Montrezl Harrell, who now plays for the Adelaide 36ers. The incident occurred after a match in November 2024. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a "landmark moment," emphasizing its collaboration with law enforcement to combat online abuse. The organization stressed its commitment to ensuring athletes can compete in a safe environment and that such actions send a clear message of zero tolerance for racism.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to travel to China for a high-level meeting with President Xi Jinping, with a focus on strengthening economic and business relationships. The trip, which includes stops in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chengdu, will also involve meetings with other senior Chinese officials and a CEO roundtable. Since taking office, Albanese's government has worked to stabilize relations and has successfully seen Beijing remove numerous trade barriers. While the visit aims to enhance cooperation, particularly in areas like green energy, Albanese reiterated his government's strategy of diversifying trade to reduce economic dependence on China.</p>

The discussions are expected to be a critical test of whether the two countries can manage their complex relationship and find areas of common ground amid growing geopolitical friction.</p>

          <p>As part of its national strategy to enhance resource security, China has identified 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of this year. The Ministry of Natural Resources reported a 31% year-on-year increase in such discoveries. These new sites include significant reserves of rubidium, a key element in telecommunications and biomedicine, as well as 81 tonnes of gold. This announcement comes as China has substantially increased its investment in mineral exploration for critical elements like tin, copper, and bauxite, which are vital for the aerospace, semiconductor, and green energy industries amid a global race for resources.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling indicating she will likely order the Trump administration to stop indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals as part of its mass deportation plan. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups, which argued that federal agents were unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong's preliminary decision suggests she will grant temporary restraining orders to block these stops and ensure detainees have access to legal counsel. The lawsuit has become a key battleground over the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

A massive response, including specialized Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. All workers were brought to the surface without any visible injuries after navigating over a large pile of dirt to escape the collapsed section.

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The judge approved a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, allowing the legal challenge against the order to proceed and temporarily halting its implementation. This ruling was carefully structured to comply with recent Supreme Court limits on nationwide injunctions. The White House criticized the decision as an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court, vowing to fight what it called an impediment to the president's elected policies.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted serial killers known as the "Hillside Stranglers" who terrorized Los Angeles in the 1970s, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. A California parole board made the decision after hearing testimony from victims and prosecutors. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of at least 12 women, whom they often lured by impersonating police officers before subjecting them to sexual assault and torture. The board determined that Bianchi, now 74, will not be eligible for another parole hearing for ten years.</p>

The hockey-puck-shaped bone fragment was uncovered in a core sample taken from a bore hole drilled over 750 feet deep as part of a geothermal energy study. Curators believe the fossil is a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon, and have now put Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery on display.</p>

President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance in a social media post, attributing its rise to his tariff policies.

The sentence comes after the 31-year-old musician pleaded guilty to charges of special quasi-sexual assault for his role in the assault of an intoxicated woman in 2024. Two other men involved in the incident also received prison sentences. The court noted the grave nature of the crime, where the defendants took advantage of a victim who was unable to resist. Taeil was removed from NCT in August 2024 after his agency became aware of the criminal case.</p>

In his new book, he identifies eight key words that consistently resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. He argues these words act as powerful "emotional shortcuts" that can be bent to fit various political narratives. While not a guarantee of victory, he suggests these words are the fundamental building blocks for crafting memorable and persuasive campaign messages.</p>
