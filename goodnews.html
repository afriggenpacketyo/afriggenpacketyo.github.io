        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has stepped in to provide emergency funding of $6.2 million to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty after the Trump administration withheld $75 million in allocated funds. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty was founded during the Cold War to combat Soviet propaganda by providing non-ideological news coverage to countries in Eastern Europe and neighboring states where press freedom is limited. The EU's foreign policy chief stated the funding is designed as a safety net for the network's independent journalism. The network has been forced to furlough employees and cut back programming due to the funding shortfall.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng soared in Hong Kong after the company reported strong first-quarter revenue and provided an optimistic revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust sales, and its net loss narrowed. Xpeng anticipates a revenue of 17.5 billion yuan to 18.7 billion yuan for the second quarter and expects to deliver 102,000 to 108,000 electric cars. This positive outlook boosted investor sentiment, with Xpeng's U.S.-listed shares also experiencing a significant rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has implemented a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. The subsidy, which revises a previous scheme, aims to reduce wholesale gasoline prices, with price reductions expected at gas stations in two to three weeks. The program is allocated around 1 trillion yen and could last until the end of March 2026. This reintroduction comes ahead of the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to bilateral tariff negotiations, agreeing that the dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests the yen's weakness against the dollar should not be a point of contention in tariff talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy. Japan is considering backing off from seeking a full removal of U.S. tariffs to strike a quick deal.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining attention as the "sell U.S." narrative strengthens, with analysts citing factors like a weaker U.S. dollar, China's economic recovery, and attractive valuations. Bank of America heralded emerging markets as "the next bull market," while JPMorgan upgraded emerging market equities. This bullishness is fueled by dented confidence in U.S. assets, marked by a selloff in U.S. Treasurys, equities, and the greenback. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has granted asylum to Afrikaners claiming violence and discrimination in South Africa, some Afrikaners dispute claims of a "White genocide." Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp says the claims are untrue, noting that Whites remain economically the strongest group in South Africa. While violent attacks on farmers occur, they are not generally racially motivated, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein. He also states that there has not been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented since apartheid ended.</p>
