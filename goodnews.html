          <p>The UK government is launching a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses and supporting key industries. The plan, which includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, intends to cut energy bills by up to 25% for over 7,000 UK manufacturers by exempting them from green energy levies. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the strategy as a turning point, emphasizing support for sectors with high growth potential and the creation of over one million new jobs. The strategy also includes upskilling initiatives, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, during the upcoming summit in The Hague. The U.S. is pushing for this increase, emphasizing that 3.5% should be allocated to pure defense and 1.5% to security-related infrastructure. While some nations are prepared to meet this target, others are hesitant, raising concerns about whether these commitments will translate into concrete action. The call for increased spending comes amidst ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, which are threatening global economic stability, with some analysts deeming this year's meeting as the most consequential in the alliance's history.</p>

          <p>The NHS is exploring the potential of using ketamine to treat severe depression, with an NHS Lothian psychiatrist hoping to establish a clinic by the end of the year. This move comes after a private clinic in Lanarkshire began offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The use of ketamine is being considered as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), offering another option for patients with hard-to-treat depression.</p>

While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, there is debate within the coalition government about the rationality of setting GDP percentages for military spending.

          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, allowing voters to rank up to five candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to voters' second choices. This process continues until only two candidates remain, with the one having the most votes declared the winner. The system aims to ensure broader support for the elected candidate and prevent fringe candidates from winning with a small plurality, although the complexity of the system can make races less predictable and requires voters to do more research.</p>

          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers in Game 7 of the NBA Finals to win their first championship since relocating from Seattle. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Finals MVP, led the Thunder with 29 points and 12 assists, as the team completed a season for the ages. The Thunder finished with 84 wins between the regular season and the playoffs, tying the 1996-97 Chicago Bulls for third most in any season. This marks the second championship for the franchise, with the Seattle SuperSonics winning in 1979 before the team moved to Oklahoma City in 2008.</p>

          <p>The U.S. men's national soccer team overcame a goalkeeping gaffe by Matt Freese to defeat Haiti 2-1 and win their Concacaf Gold Cup group with a perfect 3-0 record. Malik Tillman scored the opening goal, but Freese's error allowed Haiti to equalize before Patrick Agyemang scored the game-winning goal in the 75th minute. The U.S. team, largely comprised of a B team, had already secured a spot in the quarter-finals against Mexico or Costa Rica. The Gold Cup serves as the last competitive test for the Americans before the World Cup, which they will co-host.</p>
