          <p>The World Bank has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after payments by Saudi Arabia and Qatar, making the country eligible again for grants to fund reconstruction and economic recovery. This move follows President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and his meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a dramatic shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. The government has also signed an $800-million memorandum of understanding with DP World to develop the port of Tartus, indicating growing confidence among international investors.</p>

          <p>Staff employees at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., are planning to vote on unionization due to job uncertainty and layoffs following changes implemented by the Trump administration.

Staff members report a lack of communication and transparency, with concerns about fundraising efforts and the impact on arts programming.
