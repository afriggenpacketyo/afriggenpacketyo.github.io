          <p>Michael McFaul, former US ambassador to Russia, emphasized the urgent need for direct communication between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to address ongoing trade war issues. Speaking at an event in Beijing, McFaul highlighted the lack of dialogue between the leaders nearly four months into Trump's second term, calling the situation "horrible." He suggested that high-level engagement is crucial for improving the US-China bilateral relationship, referencing past instances where Trump's one-on-one meetings proved significant. McFaul also recommended increased government-to-government dialogue, including visits from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to China, to foster better understanding and resolution of trade disputes.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced the new "NVLink Fusion" program, which is designed to allow customers and partners to integrate non-Nvidia CPUs and GPUs with Nvidia's technology. This program expands the accessibility of NVLink, Nvidia's high-speed data transfer technology, to third-party processors, enabling the creation of semi-custom AI infrastructures. According to Huang, NVLink Fusion will allow for AI infrastructures to combine Nvidia processors with different CPUs and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), giving customers the benefit of the NVLink infrastructure and ecosystem. AI chipmaking partners for NVLink Fusion include MediaTek, Marvell, Alchip, Astera Labs, Synopsys and Cadence.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that older adults can enhance their cognitive performance with as little as five minutes of daily exercise. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of South Australia and AdventHealth Research Institute, found that moderate-to-vigorous physical activity is linked to better information processing, focus, multitasking, and short-term memory. Even moderate activities like walking can improve brain functions. Researchers emphasize that transitioning from minimal physical activity to just five minutes a day yields the most significant gains in cognitive function, although the benefits do not extend to long-term memory or visual-spatial functions.</p>
