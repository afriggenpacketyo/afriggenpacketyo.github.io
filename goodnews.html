          <p>Steel manufacturing company Cleveland-Cliffs is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earths at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. The announcement, made during its third-quarter earnings call, caused the company's shares to jump by approximately 17%. This move aligns with a broader U.S. strategy to establish domestic sources for critical minerals, reducing reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. The potential venture could position Cleveland-Cliffs as a key player in supplying materials for defense, electric vehicles, and technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Instagram is rolling out new parental controls that automatically apply 'PG-13' style content filters for all users under the age of 18. This update will restrict teen accounts from viewing mature or risky content, including sexually suggestive material and topics like alcohol or tobacco, unless a parent approves a less restrictive setting. The changes were developed based on feedback from thousands of parents who rated sample posts for age appropriateness. For stricter control, a new 'Limited Content' setting will also be available, further filtering material and restricting interactions on the platform.</p>

He takes over a team currently sitting sixth in the league and has emphasized that there is no time to waste in turning the season around and meeting fan expectations for immediate results.</p>

          <p>The Afghanistan women's national football team is set to play its first official match since 2021 after the 'FIFA Unites: Women's Series' tournament was relocated from the UAE to Morocco. The move was necessitated by the Afghan players being denied visas to enter the UAE. The team, now rebranded as Afghan Women United, has been in exile since the Taliban's return to power. Their participation marks a significant step in FIFA's 'Strategy for Action for Afghan Women's Football,' representing a voice for Afghan women whose rights have been severely restricted.</p>

          <p>Executive coach and author Melody Wilding provides five practical strategies for effectively working with a controlling and impatient manager. She advises employees to present 'rough drafts' to invite early input, reinforce their boss's authority with deferential language, and proactively overshare information to satisfy the need for oversight. Other techniques include anticipating criticism to manage feedback constructively and directly asking for positive reinforcement to balance the focus on adjustments. These methods are designed to conserve an employee's energy and make the professional relationship more manageable without causing daily frustration.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 11:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose their value more quickly than internal combustion engine cars, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. Key factors contributing to this trend include historically larger government and manufacturer incentives, which lower the baseline for resale values. Additionally, the rapid advancement of EV technology, particularly in battery range, makes older models less desirable to value-oriented used car buyers. As the market matures and a wider variety of more affordable EV models become available, these depreciation dynamics could begin to change.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the eligibility requirements for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a process that can wipe out most unsecured debts but is not available to everyone. The primary obstacle is the 'means test,' which compares a filer's household income to their state's median income. Those with income below the median generally qualify automatically, while higher earners must undergo a more detailed analysis of their disposable income after expenses. Other factors, such as recent bankruptcy filings and the completion of credit counseling, also affect eligibility. The court also scrutinizes filings for any signs of abuse, like luxury spending just before filing.</p>

          <p>Amid rising market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello suggests that income-generating funds using options-based strategies can offer a safer approach for risk-averse investors. He explains that these funds provide more structural downside protection because their performance is not solely reliant on stock correlations. This strategy can also generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is advantageous in the current economic climate. Burrello advises investors to look for ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be wary of those with unsustainable yields and high fees. (not investment advice)</p>

Wichita, Kansas, ranked as the most affordable city, where median wages are 75% higher than what is needed to rent a typical studio. The index, which uses the 30% rule for rent-to-income ratios, found that 41 of the analyzed cities were unaffordable, an increase from 38 last year. Several Texas cities, including Dallas and Austin, shifted from the affordable to the unaffordable category due to rising rents.</p>
