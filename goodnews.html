          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 22:42:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicated that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from May's decline, largely driven by a marginal increase in new export orders. This divergence from the official PMI, which surveys larger state-owned enterprises, suggests a mixed but potentially stabilizing economic picture for the nation's manufacturing sector amid ongoing trade headwinds.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large U.S. technology companies after President Trump threatened tariff hikes and halted trade talks. The White House characterized the move as Prime Minister Mark Carney "caving" to pressure, while Carney stated it was part of a "bigger negotiation" as trade talks resumed. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Google and Amazon, and its removal is seen as a significant victory for the U.S. tech industry, though it has drawn criticism from Canada's opposition party.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has requested that some California National Guard troops, deployed to Los Angeles by the Trump administration to handle protests, be shifted to assist with wildfire preparations. The proposal suggests moving 200 of the 4,000 troops to help address what is expected to be an early and active fire season, a concern heightened by the controversial deployment that state officials argued had depleted firefighting resources. This development occurs amid an ongoing legal battle between California's governor and the federal government over the legality of the initial troop deployment.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, may help slow the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine can prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs by inhibiting a specific enzyme. These findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of physical activity and could inform future strategies designed to simulate the positive effects of exercise.</p>

He argues these investors are less concerned with traditional metrics or Federal Reserve policy and more interested in compelling "stories" and disruptive ideas, citing the rise of stocks like Robinhood and Reddit. According to Cramer, this shift has created an "idea market" where companies are rewarded for ambitious growth plans rather than conservative strategies like stock buybacks.

In an interview, he attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making forward purchases and deploying inventory in advance to avoid the tariffs. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with millions of sellers, helps keep prices in check as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.</p>
