          <p>The USDA has temporarily put on hold its demand for sensitive data about Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients from states. This decision comes after a lawsuit was filed alleging that the request violated federal privacy laws. The USDA had requested states to turn over personal data of SNAP recipients, including names, birth dates, and Social Security numbers, citing President Trump's executive order on eliminating information silos. The agency stated that it is taking procedural steps to ensure data is appropriately safeguarded and to satisfy legal requirements. Optimism score is not applicable here.</p>
