        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the question of how much gold an investor should buy each year to safeguard their portfolio amidst economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, and shifting global politics. Experts recommend considering one's risk appetite, suggesting allocations between 5% for growth-oriented investors and up to 20% for risk-averse individuals, with a sweet spot generally between 5% and 10% of the total portfolio. The article advises gradual buying throughout the year to mitigate price volatility and to monitor market conditions, such as interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events, to inform purchasing decisions, while also cautioning against over-investing due to storage, taxes, and liquidity concerns.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this CNBC article, the world experienced a U.S.-China trade embargo, but a breakthrough on Monday with lowered tariffs signals a new era of "mutual respect." U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized this respect during talks, contrasting with previous strained interactions. Businesses now understand the need to mitigate tariff uncertainty, and while large businesses will diversify supply chains, small businesses may halt production due to fading confidence in the U.S. dollar. China is also focusing on self-sufficiency, strengthening export controls on critical minerals and emphasizing its role as a stabilizing force amid global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo holds a double-digit lead in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, according to a Marist College survey, despite facing financial setbacks and criticism over past controversies. Cuomo's campaign has been denied matching funds twice due to documentation errors and alleged coordination with a super PAC. Opponents have criticized him for his 2021 resignation and handling of COVID-19, with current Mayor Eric Adams demanding answers about nursing home deaths. Despite these challenges, the poll indicates Cuomo's strong position in the race.</p>

          <p>Japan's health ministry is planning to eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for childbirth, potentially starting in April 2026, to combat the country's declining birthrate. The policy involves fully covering normal delivery costs under the public medical insurance system, which currently excludes childbirth as it is not considered a medical condition. While the government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per birth, actual costs often exceed this amount. Obstetricians have raised concerns that a unified, publicly covered price could strain medical institutions due to reduced revenue.</p>

          <p>This Vox article highlights the NeoTest program, which aims to combat neonatal sepsis, a major cause of infant mortality in developing countries, by developing a rapid and affordable diagnostic test. The program seeks to raise $120 million for an advance market commitment (AMC) to incentivize manufacturers to produce a test that delivers results within minutes. The NeoTest team is primarily approaching middle-income countries to fund the initiative, reflecting the increasing capacity of these nations to address their own health challenges. The project could demonstrate that significant international health projects can be funded largely by the countries they are intended to benefit.</p>

          <p>This DW article highlights that Mascha Schilinski is screening her film "Sound of Falling" at the 78th Cannes International Film Festival. Schilinski's film is vying for the coveted Golden Palm award with works by directors like Wes Anderson, Kelly Reichardt and Richard Linklater. "Sound of Falling" is set on a farm in a small village in northeastern Germany. It follows the lives of four generations of women living on the farm, interweaving their stories by jumping back and forth among the different timelines until the lines between them blur, and what starts as portraits of four generations becomes a sweeping depiction of a century.</p>
