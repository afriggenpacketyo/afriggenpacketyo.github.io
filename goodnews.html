          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has acquired 550 shares of Cisco Systems, citing the company's strategic shift towards artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The article highlights Cisco's recent success in securing $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders ahead of schedule, demonstrating its growing influence in the lucrative cloud computing market. The company's transition to a subscription-based software model, which now accounts for 56% of total revenue, is also noted for improving gross margins and providing more predictable income streams. With a strong record of returning cash to shareholders and an undemanding valuation, the club sees potential for the stock to appreciate further. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, Germany and the United Kingdom have signed a historic friendship treaty in London to deepen their post-Brexit relationship. The "Kensington Treaty," sealed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, establishes closer cooperation on security, defense, and efforts to combat illegal immigration. Key provisions include pursuing joint defense export campaigns, establishing a new direct rail link, and simplifying visas for school exchanges. Both leaders hailed the agreement as a new chapter, emphasizing the need for stronger European ties amid growing geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a third offer for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, with the bid valued at an initial £65 million plus £5 million in add-ons. United is said to be confident in securing the 25-year-old Cameroon international, hoping to finalize the deal before the team's preseason tour in the United States. Mbeumo, who scored 20 Premier League goals last season, had attracted interest from other clubs but reportedly preferred a move to Old Trafford. The potential transfer comes as United aims to bolster its attacking options after scoring only 44 league goals last season.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo's stock gained over 6% after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. Despite a drop in worldwide volume, executives expressed confidence that a new strategic plan will revive weak North American demand in the coming quarters. The plan involves leaning into healthier snacking trends, launching new multicultural products, and optimizing marketing spend and logistics to cut costs. The company reaffirmed its full-year outlook, expecting organic revenue to grow by a low single-digit percentage and core earnings per share to remain roughly unchanged from the prior year.</p>

          <p>China has launched a unique experiment to its Tiangong space station: a credit-card-sized chip containing living human brain cells and blood vessels. This "mini-brain" is designed to study the effects of microgravity on cognitive functions, such as dizziness and sleep problems, experienced by astronauts during long missions. The model is the first of its kind in space, featuring a highly integrated design that includes a blood-brain barrier, offering more human-like data than previous experiments. Researchers hope the real-time observations will advance space medicine, neuroscience, and drug development.</p>

          <p>United Airlines surpassed second-quarter earnings estimates and issued a positive forecast for the remainder of 2025, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that a less uncertain world is boosting travel demand. After a weak start to the year, the airline now expects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the full year. The carrier's second-quarter revenue rose 1.7% to $15.24 billion, though unit revenue declined, particularly on domestic routes. Operational constraints at its Newark hub, caused by air traffic controller shortages, negatively impacted profit margins, but the overall outlook remains confident.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is poised to vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, after overcoming a rebellion from right-wing Republicans. The procedural vote was stalled for hours as a group of conservatives sought to attach other measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. After negotiations involving Donald Trump, a deal was reached to advance the crypto bill separately, with the central bank currency ban to be tied to a future defense bill. The legislation aims to bring long-overdue rules to the volatile digital asset market.</p>

          <p>As Disneyland celebrates its 70th anniversary, the strategy of building immersive experiences around its vast portfolio of intellectual property remains a cornerstone of the company's success. The experiences division, which includes parks and resorts, is a major profit driver, fueled by franchises acquired under CEO Bob Iger, such as Star Wars, Marvel, and Avatar. Disney plans to invest $60 billion in this division over the next decade, with new lands and attractions based on popular IP like "Monsters Inc." and "Encanto." While this strategy sometimes involves replacing older, non-IP rides, it has consistently broadened the parks' audience and boosted revenue.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's Labour government has announced it will lower the voting age from 18 to 16 for national elections, fulfilling a key campaign promise. The reform, which is expected to be in place before the next election, will also include measures like automatic voter registration and allowing bank cards as a form of voter ID. These changes aim to increase democratic participation after turnout in the 2024 election hit a two-decade low. While the move is hailed by some as a major electoral reform, some experts question whether it will significantly increase youth engagement.</p>

The streets of Taipei emptied as traffic halted and businesses closed, with authorities issuing mobile alerts to guide citizens. The drills are a response to escalating military and political pressure from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the self-governing island and has not ruled out using force to achieve unification.</p>

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has posthumously cleared Errol Campbell and overturned the conviction of Ronald De Souza, two men who were wrongly convicted in the 1970s based on fabricated evidence from a corrupt police officer. Both cases were orchestrated by Detective Sergeant Derek Ridgewell of the British Transport Police, who was known for targeting young Black men and was later jailed for theft. The court expressed regret for the decades of suffering endured by the men and their families. This marks the 13th conviction linked to Ridgewell to be successfully overturned following investigations by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.</p>
