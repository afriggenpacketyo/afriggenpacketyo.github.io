          <p>President Trump's recent trip to Scotland yielded a significant trade deal with the European Union, which will see the EU purchase billions in US energy and military equipment in exchange for a 15% tariff rate. During the visit, he held talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the crisis in Gaza and the war in Ukraine, signaling a potential shift in his approach to both conflicts. While promoting his golf resorts, Trump also faced questions regarding the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, which he addressed by denying any wrongdoing. The visit blended presidential duties with personal business promotion, highlighting his unconventional diplomatic style.</p>

          <p>Following two days of high-level negotiations in Stockholm, the United States and China have agreed to continue the existing pause on tariff increases. While no major breakthroughs were announced, officials from both nations confirmed the extension, stating they would push for its continuation. China’s Vice-Minister of Commerce, Li Chenggang, described the talks as comprehensive and candid, covering macroeconomic situations and mutual concerns. The agreement provides temporary stability in the trade relationship between the world's two largest economies, though underlying tensions remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Boeing has shown clear signs of a turnaround, reporting sharply reduced quarterly losses and a 35% jump in revenue. The aerospace giant delivered 150 airplanes in the second quarter, its best performance since 2018, signaling progress in stabilizing production and improving quality under new leadership. The company lost $176 million, a significant improvement from the $1.09 billion loss a year earlier, and is aiming to generate positive cash flow in the fourth quarter. Despite this progress, challenges remain, including the delayed certification of its Max 7 and Max 10 jets until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

The leaders also discussed the humanitarian situation in Gaza and US policy on North Sea oil and gas taxation. The meeting, which took place at Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort, was part of a broader trip that combined official business with the promotion of his commercial interests.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has proposed an $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first single-line transcontinental railroad in United States history. The merger aims to connect Union Pacific's extensive western network with Norfolk Southern's network across 22 eastern states, streamlining national deliveries and reducing handoff delays. The landmark proposal will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators at the Surface Transportation Board, which has set a high bar for such deals due to past service disruptions following major consolidations. If approved, the move could trigger further mergers among the remaining major North American railroads. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, now projecting 3% growth in 2025 and 3.1% in 2026. This upward revision is partly attributed to a modest easing of trade tensions and a surge in U.S. imports as businesses rushed to get ahead of new tariffs. The IMF noted that this "front-loading" of trade provided a short-term boost but carries risks of future slowdowns. While the global outlook has improved since April, the IMF warned that heightened tariffs and geopolitical uncertainty could still weaken economic activity moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card credit card business from Goldman Sachs, according to sources familiar with the matter. This move would allow Goldman Sachs to exit its challenging foray into consumer credit cards, which has faced profitability issues and regulatory scrutiny. For JPMorgan, already the largest U.S. credit card issuer, acquiring the portfolio would further solidify its market dominance. The deal would provide Apple with a stable, experienced partner for its popular card program after a period of high but turbulent growth under Goldman Sachs.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by stable consumer demand. However, the consumer goods giant issued a cautious outlook for its 2026 fiscal year, forecasting a significant $1 billion pretax negative impact due to higher costs from recently implemented tariffs. The company plans to offset some of these costs through productivity improvements and sourcing changes but stated that some price increases on its products will be necessary. The guidance reflects the ongoing volatility in the global economic environment and its direct impact on multinational corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club announced the sale of 215 shares of Wells Fargo, locking in a substantial gain after the stock fully recovered from a recent slide. The bank's shares had initially fallen after management lowered its net interest income outlook but rebounded as the market recognized the strength of its fee-based businesses. The article notes that Wells Fargo's strategy to build out its investment bank is paying off, as evidenced by its advisory roles in two major multi-billion dollar deals announced Tuesday. This sale is presented as a strategic move to right-size the position rather than a change in the long-term positive thesis for the bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's public calls for lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its upcoming meeting. Economists cite the resilient labor market and the potential inflationary impact of new tariffs as key reasons for the central bank's cautious stance. The Fed has kept its rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range since December 2024 to manage inflation. While some Fed governors have signaled a desire for a cut, the consensus remains that policymakers will wait for more data, with a potential rate reduction seen as more likely at the September meeting.

          <p>A recent article highlights several factors driving strong investor interest in Nvidia, which recently surpassed a $4 trillion market capitalization. Key reasons cited include surging confidence in the company's dominance of AI infrastructure and anticipation for its next-generation Blackwell Ultra products, expected in 2025. The company's resilience, demonstrated by its ability to absorb financial shocks from Chinese export restrictions while still posting record revenue, is also noted as a major strength. Furthermore, the explosive growth in its data center revenue, which jumped 73% year-over-year, positions Nvidia to capitalize on the rapidly expanding global demand for AI computing power.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a record number of certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing in 2025, savers face a key decision on where to place their funds next. Experts advise against passively allowing CDs to auto-renew, as current rates are likely lower than when the accounts were opened. Instead, savers should proactively compare options, such as opening a new CD with a different term or at a different institution, moving the money to a more liquid high-yield savings account, or investing it elsewhere. Although CD rates have fallen, they remain historically high, and locking in a guaranteed return now could be a smart move before potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
