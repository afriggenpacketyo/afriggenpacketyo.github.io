        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts address the common question of whether credit card debt can be inherited, clarifying that it generally cannot unless you are a co-signer or joint account holder. The deceased person's estate is typically responsible for settling debts, and if the estate lacks sufficient funds, the remaining balance may go unpaid. Spouses in community property states may be responsible for debt incurred during the marriage. It's advised to consult with an estate attorney to clarify legal responsibilities and avoid potential financial headaches.</p>
