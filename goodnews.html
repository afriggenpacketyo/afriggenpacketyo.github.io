          <p>Professor Lu Wei, a senior investigator at the US National Institutes of Health, has returned to China to work with the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (SMART). This move comes amid funding cuts to university research grants in the US. Lu's research focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms of synaptic development and functional regulation, as well as the effects of anxiety, depression, anesthesia, and alcohol. His relocation is expected to significantly bolster Shenzhen's ambitions to become a national center for biomedical research.</p>

While the Army has met its recruiting goal for the year, officials believe the parade will inspire a new generation to serve.

The MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, with specific durations for different medications.

          <p>This article explores the generational divide in views on sex and gender in Britain, particularly regarding women‚Äôs and transgender rights. Younger people are more likely to disagree with the supreme court ruling that the legal definition of "woman" is based on biological sex. The author argues that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist and congruent with consumer capitalism. The life cycle also influences views on biological sex, with experiences like childbirth and menopause shaping perspectives.</p>

          <p>Two major convenience store chains in Japan, Family Mart and Lawson Inc., have started selling government-released stockpiled rice at select stores in Tokyo and Osaka. This is to increase availability of the staple food for consumers struggling with soaring rice prices. The rice from the 2021 harvest will be sold in small portions to make it affordable for people, including those living alone. The move follows similar actions by major supermarkets and e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>A rare oil portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, painted in the UK in 1931, will be auctioned in London next month. The portrait, made by British artist Clare Leighton, is thought to be the only oil portrait that Gandhi actually sat for. It was created when Gandhi attended the second Round Table conference in London to discuss constitutional reforms for India. The painting remained in the artist's collection until her death in 1989 and has been passed down through her family.</p>

          <h2>Retired Police Dogs Deserve Pensions, Advocates Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complicated medical needs. These dogs put their lives at risk in the line of duty, and their care can be expensive after retirement. Many adopters face significant costs for chronic health issues and injuries sustained during their service. The lack of support could deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for some dogs.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan is actively pitching to WWE legend Triple H to bring WrestleMania to London. If the event were to come to the U.K.'s capital city, it would be the first time the event is hosted outside of North America. Khan held talks with Levesque in July last year, adding to the speculation. He believes it would open a new market for the WWE and create a festival atmosphere.</p>
