          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump share more similarities than differences, particularly in their ideological opposition to the political establishment. Both men are portrayed as outsiders who challenged the status quo, with Reagan opposing D√©tente with the Soviet Union and Trump embracing some Democratic policies. The article asserts that both presidents champion conservative ideas centered on the individual, such as tax cuts, a strong national defense, and pro-life stances. While trade may be a separating issue, the author contends that both leaders used tariffs when necessary to protect American interests. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NPR's College Podcast Challenge grand prize winner, 'Just Friends' by Jo Strogatz, explores the concept of happiness through non-traditional relationships, focusing on the life of Steve Small, a man in his 60s who has found fulfillment in friendships rather than romantic partnerships. Strogatz, a recent graduate, examines questions about love, romance, and friendships, using original music to enhance the storytelling. Small's experiences living through the AIDS epidemic and witnessing failed relationships shaped his perspective on love, leading him to prioritize friendships as his closest connections. The podcast encourages listeners to redefine happiness and find fulfillment outside conventional romantic relationships.</p>

          <h2>NASA Engineers Remotely Revive Voyager 1's Primary Thrusters After Backup System Shows Signs of Failure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with the potential loss of contact with Voyager 1, NASA engineers successfully revived the spacecraft's primary roll thrusters after they had been dormant for two decades. The decision was made when the backup thrusters, used since 2004, showed signs of weakening due to fuel line residue. With the Deep Space Station 43 antenna scheduled to go offline for upgrades, engineers risked reactivating the primary thrusters, suspecting an electronics glitch had caused them to shut down initially. This successful remote fix ensures the antenna remains aligned with Earth, allowing Voyager 1 to continue its interstellar journey and potentially celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

          <p>The NBA playoffs this year guarantee the end of a long-standing title drought for one of the remaining teams: the Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Minnesota Timberwolves, or New York Knicks. Three of these teams have never won a title in their current city, while the Knicks haven't won since 1973. The absence of usual powerhouses like Steph Curry and LeBron James signals a shift towards a younger generation of stars, including Jalen Brunson, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Tyrese Haliburton, and Anthony Edwards. This wide-open competition marks a new era of parity in the NBA, with multiple teams vying for their first championship in decades.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric car battery maker, excluded U.S. onshore investors from its Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) due to increasing tensions between the United States and China. This exclusion marks a significant shift from previous IPOs, such as Alibaba's, and underscores the deepening financial decoupling between the two countries. CATL, labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, faced pressure from U.S. lawmakers to deter Wall Street banks from participating in the listing. Despite these challenges, the IPO was successful, raising $4.6 billion, with major investors including Kuwait's sovereign wealth fund and Oaktree Capital Management.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, rose over 16% in their Hong Kong trading debut, driven by investor confidence in the company's position in the electric vehicle market. The IPO raised $4.6 billion, making it the largest offering globally this year. CATL plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. This expansion coincides with increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China, and the company's inclusion on a U.S. watchlist due to suspected military links.</p>

Cohen's intelligence gathering in Syria during the early 1960s is credited with helping Israel win the Arab-Israeli war of 1967. While the acquisition does not reveal the location of Cohen's remains, it is seen as a unifying moment in Israel, symbolizing both success and failure.</p>
