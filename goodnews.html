          <p>This article details the story of the Langenhop family, whose three children were diagnosed with LAD-1, a rare genetic disorder that impairs white blood cell function and leads to frequent infections. Unable to find suitable bone marrow donors, the family enrolled their children in a clinical trial testing an experimental gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. The therapy involves modifying the patient's own stem cells to correct the genetic defect. All nine patients in the trial, including the Langenhop children, have shown positive results, with improved immune function and no severe infections since treatment. Optimism is high as the therapy is now under review by the FDA for potential approval as a licensed treatment.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Catalonia, Spain, lifted confinement orders affecting 160,000 people after a fire at an industrial estate in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫ caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The fire, which originated at a swimming pool cleaning products firm, prompted officials to urge residents to stay indoors as a precaution. Fire services stabilized the blaze and monitored toxic levels, reporting no casualties. The warehouse owner suggested a lithium battery might have caused the fire, and the emergency measure was lifted as the toxic cloud dissipated.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the Alternative for Germany (AfD)'s legal challenge against the German domestic intelligence agency (BfV)'s classification of the party as "confirmed right-wing extremist." While the BfV has temporarily suspended this classification to allow for a court review, the article clarifies that this does not equate to the BfV withdrawing its assessment. Legal experts emphasize that the BfV still considers its classification accurate and is only pausing its application to allow the court time to properly review the case, which involves over 1,000 pages of documentation.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on the re-entry of Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus in 1972, which re-entered Earth's atmosphere and splashed down in the Indian Ocean after a failed launch left it stranded in Earth's orbit. The event serves as a reminder of the ambitious Soviet Venera program and the Cold War space race, during which the Soviet Union achieved significant milestones in Venus exploration. The article highlights the technological challenges of sending probes to Venus and the legacy of the Venera program, which included the first successful landing and data transmission from the planet's surface.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have refuted claims that she influenced script decisions for the film *It Ends With Us*, which is at the center of a legal battle between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively. Baldoni alleges Swift, along with Ryan Reynolds, acted as Lively's "dragons" during script rewrite discussions. Swift's team asserts she had no creative input or involvement in casting. Lively is suing Baldoni for sexual harassment and a smear campaign, while Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and Reynolds for civil extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), introduced by Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar, seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances in the US. The bill would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that restrict federal funding for research on Schedule I substances. Supporters argue that the bill is a modest but meaningful step forward that could attract bipartisan support, enabling policymakers to study what works and craft effective, informed legislation in the future. Aaron Smith, CEO of the National Cannabis Industry Association, is less hopeful about the bill's prospects due to the current hyper-partisan environment.</p>
