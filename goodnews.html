          <p>The South Texas community that hosts Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company has officially voted to become the city of Starbase, fulfilling Musk's ambition to create a company town. With 212 votes in favor and only 6 against, the vote solidifies SpaceX's control over the 1.5 square mile area near the Mexico border. While supporters cite the jobs and investment SpaceX brings, critics worry about Musk's increased authority, including the potential to close a popular beach and state park for launch operations, and a proposed bill would make it a misdemeanor to not comply with an order to evacuate the beach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Japan revealed that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships chose not to legally marry due to the country's law requiring couples to adopt the same surname. The survey also indicated that this rate is higher among people in their 20s, with over 60% of that group stating they would consider legal marriage if separate surnames were permitted. This highlights the impact of the surname law on personal choices and the desire for greater flexibility in marital arrangements.</p>
