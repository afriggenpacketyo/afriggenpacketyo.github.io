          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub unit since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to pursue a new venture as a founder. His departure comes as GitHub faces increasing competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools, often called "vibe coding," from startups like Anysphere, Replit, and Windsurf. While GitHub's AI tool, Copilot, continues to grow, with 20 million users reported, these emerging competitors are gaining traction among developers. Dohmke will remain with the company through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, with GitHub now operating under Microsoft's CoreAI division.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he personally negotiated a deal with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, requiring the company to pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenue from H20 chip sales to China. Trump stated he initially demanded a 20% share but settled for the lower figure after negotiations. He characterized the H20 chip as "obsolete," suggesting it poses no national security threat because China already possesses similar technology, and noted that more advanced chips like Blackwell would not be approved for sale without significant performance reductions. This arrangement was a condition for granting export licenses allowing Nvidia to resume sales to the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to delay the reimposition of high tariffs on Chinese goods for an additional 90 days. The order was signed just hours before a pause on the tariffs was set to expire, which would have caused U.S. duties on Chinese imports to return to their peak levels from April. This extension was the anticipated result of recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. The move continues a temporary truce in the trade war between the two economic powers, which began after an initial 90-day pause was agreed upon in May.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a British researcher who disappeared in Antarctica in 1959 at age 25, have been discovered near a receding glacier. Bell, a meteorologist, fell into a crevasse during a survey and his body was never recovered. A Polish research team found his remains along with over 200 personal items, and his identity was confirmed through DNA analysis. His surviving brother expressed shock and gratitude for the discovery, which brings closure to a 66-year-old mystery. The finding is part of a growing trend of discoveries as melting glaciers around the world expose long-lost individuals.</p>

          <p>The stock market has shown a muted reaction to the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their AI chip sales to China. Investors appear to view the agreement as a net positive, as it restores access to the lucrative Chinese market, which had been cut off by stricter export controls. Analysts suggest that earning 85% of potential revenue is preferable to earning nothing and that maintaining a competitive presence in China prevents ceding the market entirely to local competitors. While the fee represents a significant sum, it is considered manageable relative to Nvidia's massive projected revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FIFA has launched its largest-ever volunteer program, seeking 65,000 individuals to support the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Volunteers, who must be at least 18 years old, will assist in various roles at stadiums, training sites, airports, and hotels across the 16 host cities. While the positions are unpaid, they offer a unique behind-the-scenes experience at the historic 48-team tournament. FIFA President Gianni Infantino called volunteers the "heart, soul and smile" of the event, encouraging interested individuals to apply and share their local pride with millions of visiting fans.</p>

          <p>Paramount has acquired the U.S. media rights for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion.

          <p>Cannabis stocks experienced a significant rally following a report that President Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana to a less-dangerous drug category under federal law. Trump later confirmed he is looking into the matter and expects to make a determination within weeks. Currently a Schedule I drug alongside heroin, a move to Schedule III would ease tax burdens on cannabis companies and likely encourage institutional investment. Industry leaders expressed optimism that a reclassification would be a "gamechanger" for the market, although the final authority for such a change rests with the Attorney General and the DEA.</p>
