          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler rate than the 2.8% economists had predicted. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%, aligning with forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, saw a 3.1% annual increase. Economists are closely monitoring the data for the effects of tariffs, with some analysts suggesting the resulting price increases may be more lasting than a temporary shock.

          <p>The body of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a 25-year-old British meteorologist, has been found and identified 66 years after he disappeared in Antarctica. Bell fell into a crevasse in 1959 while on an expedition for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey. His remains were discovered in January and formally identified through DNA comparison with his surviving siblings, who expressed shock and astonishment at the discovery. The British Antarctic Survey praised Bell as one of many brave early explorers and noted the discovery brings closure to a long-standing mystery.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the widespread nostalgia for the 1990s, arguing that by many objective measures, life today is significantly better. It cites data showing that the 1990s had far higher rates of violent crime in the U.S. compared to the present. The article also points to massive global progress, such as a dramatic reduction in extreme poverty and major advances in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Furthermore, it highlights increased social tolerance, higher educational attainment, and narrowed opportunity gaps as evidence that the present day surpasses the "good old days."</p>

          <p>Swiss sneaker company On reported a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and margin guidance despite new tariffs on goods from Vietnam. The company, which sources heavily from Vietnam, raised prices in July but has not seen a negative impact on consumer demand. On's net loss was attributed to foreign exchange fluctuations, but revenue significantly beat Wall Street expectations, with strong growth in all major global markets, including a 50% sales increase in China.

          <p>Shares of Circle Internet Group rose after the company, in its first quarterly report since going public, announced a 53% surge in revenue to $658.1 million. This growth was driven by a 90% year-over-year increase in the circulation of its USDC stablecoin. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance reflects growing institutional interest in stablecoins, boosted by more supportive U.S. crypto legislation. Circle also announced plans for a new blockchain, called Arc, designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba's instant commerce platform, Taobao Shangou, has reportedly overtaken rival Meituan in daily orders within China's highly competitive on-demand delivery market. The shift occurred after Meituan ended a promotional period, allowing Alibaba's subsidy-fueled campaign to capture a larger market share. According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, the industry is moving from a Meituan monopoly to a duopoly, with both companies projected to hold nearly equal shares of the on-demand market by 2030. While Meituan is expected to maintain its dominance in food delivery, its overall market share in instant commerce is predicted to decline.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty is managing the impact of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods while moving forward with its $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's skincare brand, Rhode. Despite a 30% decline in net income attributed to tariffs, the company's CEO remains confident, pointing to 26 consecutive quarters of sales growth. The acquisition of Rhode, a rapidly growing brand that will bring E.l.f. products into Sephora, is seen by analysts as a potentially accretive move, solidifying E.l.f.'s position as a major player challenging legacy brands.

          <p>With rising temperatures, animal welfare charities like the RSPCA are reminding pet owners about the dangers of heatstroke in dogs. Experts advise against walking dogs during the hottest parts of the day, recommending a "pavement test" to check if the ground is too hot for a dog's paws. Signs of heatstroke include excessive panting, confusion, and collapse, and require immediate action to cool the animal down. The article also provides tips for keeping pets comfortable, such as providing ample shade and water, using pet-safe sunscreen, and never leaving an animal in a locked vehicle.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for another 90 days, delaying a significant tariff hike that was set to take effect. President Trump signed an executive order to keep the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30%, while China will maintain its 10% tariff on American goods. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at resolving trade imbalances and what the White House terms "unfair trade practices." Despite the pause, the ongoing tensions have already impacted trade flows, with one U.S. business owner telling the BBC the continued uncertainty makes it impossible to plan.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer Dillian Whyte has encouraged two-time world champion Anthony Joshua to fight YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul, stating that if the matchup makes business sense and generates large numbers, he should pursue it. Whyte, who is preparing for his own fight against Moses Itauma, acknowledged that Joshua would likely earn a massive purse from such an event. Despite endorsing the potential spectacle, Whyte also emphasized that he still has "unfinished business" with Joshua, referencing their memorable 2015 bout and a cancelled 2023 rematch.</p>

Despite concerns about cheating and the quality of AI-generated content, the push for AI in classrooms is accelerating, backed by government initiatives and major tech partnerships.</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden achieved a significant legal victory as the Nevada Supreme Court ruled his lawsuit against the NFL can proceed in civil court. The 5-2 decision rejected the NFL's attempt to move the case to binding arbitration, where the league commissioner could have designated the arbitrator. Gruden's lawsuit alleges the NFL maliciously leaked racist, homophobic, and sexist emails he wrote while working as an analyst, leading to his resignation in 2021. His attorney stated the ruling helps vindicate Gruden's reputation and clears the way for him to seek justice.</p>
