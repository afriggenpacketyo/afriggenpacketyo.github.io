        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka started her French Open campaign impressively, defeating Kamilla Rakhimova in straight sets. Sabalenka only needed an hour to win the match, displaying dominant form with five aces and breaking her opponent's serve five times. As a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, Sabalenka has never reached the final of the French Open, with her best performance being a semi-final run in 2023. This victory justifies her position as one of the favorites for the tournament.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to enforce rules on Monday regarding the phonetic readings of children's names in Chinese characters. This move aims to address concerns about "kirakira names," which are flashy or unusual readings. The revised law mandates that all names in the national family registry include phonetic readings, effectively prohibiting interpretations deemed too disconnected from the characters used.</p>
