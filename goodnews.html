          <p>Mark Carney, the newly elected Prime Minister of Canada, secured his victory on a platform of standing up to Donald Trump's economic and territorial ambitions. He emphasized the need for Canadians to support each other and fight back against what he views as Trump's betrayal and threats to Canada's sovereignty. Carney's campaign strategy involved portraying himself as the leader best equipped to handle Trump's policies, uniting voters from various political backgrounds, including those concerned about Canada's independence from the United States. His win marked a significant shift in Canadian politics, driven by concerns over trade and national identity.</p>
