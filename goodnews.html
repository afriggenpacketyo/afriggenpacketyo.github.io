          <p>LindellTV, founded by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, has gained access to the White House briefing room, raising concerns about the objectivity of its reporting. The channel, which mixes right-wing conspiracy theories with product endorsements, features favorable coverage of Trump and his allies. This has helped to take the edge off what has been a traditionally adversarial relationship between journalists and the White House press secretary. Lindell's broadcasts often include unsubstantiated claims about the 2020 election and promotions for MyPillow products, blurring the lines between news and advertising.</p>
