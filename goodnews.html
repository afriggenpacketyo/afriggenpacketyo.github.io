          <p>Crystal Palace won the FA Cup against Manchester City, marking their first major trophy in the club's history, celebrated by fans and commentators alike.

The fans roared their team on, drowning out the City supporters, and the atmosphere at Wembley was electric with a mix of agony and joy. This victory reminded Shearer of Newcastle's Carabao Cup win, highlighting a year of unexpected triumphs.</p>

          <p>Wealthy shoppers continue to spend on high-end jewelry, driving growth in the luxury market, particularly for brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, and Cartier. While broader luxury spending is slowing down, the super-rich are becoming more selective, favoring only the most desirable brands. This trend benefits Richemont, the Swiss luxury group that owns these sought-after jewelry brands, as evidenced by their strong sales growth in the Jewellery Maisons division. Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with jewelry being the strongest segment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the region into near-zero visibility conditions and prompting the National Weather Service to issue dust storm warnings, even for Chicago. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was fueled by strong winds from thunderstorms lifting dry soil into the air. Visibility dropped dramatically, affecting major highways and airport operations. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois, with moisture levels at record lows, contributed to the severity of the storm, reminiscent of dust storms during the Dust Bowl era.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw made his season debut for the Dodgers after recovering from surgery, but struggled with command, allowing five runs in four innings as the Angels secured an 11-9 victory. Despite the loss, Kershaw expressed appreciation for being back on the mound at Dodger Stadium and noted glimpses of his old form. Manager Dave Roberts highlighted Kershaw's improved velocity and mix of pitches, while acknowledging the need for more consistent command. The Dodgers are currently dealing with injuries to several starting pitchers, making Kershaw's return particularly important.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts Europe's revitalized night train network with America's underfunded and neglected rail system. He argues that Europe's commitment to rail travel reflects a value for infrastructure and sustainability, while America's car-centric culture leads to congestion and unhappiness. Richards criticizes America's focus on unproven, niche transit projects instead of investing in proven rail networks. He advocates for revitalized railways in the United States to promote community, connection, and a more sustainable way of life.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a stable fibre-optic gyroscope, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope can sense orientation and turning rates, crucial for inertial navigation systems that operate without external signals, offering immunity to interference. Traditional gyroscopes use moving mechanical components, but fibre-optic gyroscopes rely on the changing movement of light in optical fibres. Interferometric fibre-optic gyroscopes are already used in military and civilian applications, from aerospace to autonomous vehicles.</p>
