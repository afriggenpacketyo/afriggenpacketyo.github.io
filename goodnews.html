          <p>Harvard University sued the Trump administration following the Department of Homeland Security's decision to block the university from enrolling international students, a move seen as retaliation for Harvard's exercise of its First Amendment rights. The lawsuit accuses the administration of a ‚Äúcampaign of retribution‚Äù and claims the decision would erase a quarter of Harvard's student body. Harvard President Alan Garber condemned the action as unlawful and unwarranted, emphasizing the destabilizing impact on the university's existence and the futures of thousands of students and scholars. The suit also claims that the administration failed to explain why Harvard's response to a previous request for information was deemed insufficient. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 50% tariff on goods imported from the European Union, citing stalled trade talks and long-standing trade deficits.

          <p>China is strongly protesting the new US restrictions on Chinese-made microchips, reflecting Beijing's determination to resist further concessions in its technology and trade disputes with Washington. The US recently announced a global ban on advanced AI-powered chips made by Chinese companies, prompting China to threaten punishment for those enforcing the ban. This firm response indicates China's growing confidence in challenging Washington on trade and technology, aiming to pressure the US to reconsider the chip rules. Analysts suggest that Beijing's reaction is partly due to the timing of the ban during a 90-day trade truce. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study refutes the theory that COVID-19 originated from a lab leak in Wuhan, China, instead tracing the virus to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province. Researchers analyzed 167 bat coronavirus genomes, concluding that the virus's most recent ancestor circulated five to seven years before the pandemic. These findings contradict claims by the White House, which has asserted a Chinese lab leak as the "real source" of the pandemic. The study examined sarbecoviruses, including those responsible for SARS and COVID-19, and found that the original SARS-CoV-1 circulated in western China shortly before the 2002-2004 outbreak. </p>

          <p>Community groups in Louisiana are challenging a state law that restricts the use of air quality data from low-cost monitors, arguing it violates their free speech rights. The law, which requires expensive EPA-standard monitors for alleging clean air violations, has been criticized for silencing community voices and enabling polluting industries. Community groups, like RISE St. James, used low-cost sensors to track pollution spikes and oppose a plastics plant. The lawsuit claims the law disproportionately affects lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color, hindering their ability to advocate for stricter pollution controls. </p>

          <p>Personal finance app Monarch has secured $75 million in funding, valuing the company at $850 million, despite a challenging environment for fintech startups. The company's subscriber base surged following the shutdown of Mint, a popular budgeting tool, with users seeking alternatives. Monarch aims to provide an all-in-one app for managing spending, investments, and financial goals, distinguishing itself from Mint by relying on paying subscribers rather than advertising or data sales. The Series B round was led by Forerunner Ventures and FPV Ventures. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Russia and Ukraine had completed a major prisoner exchange, though a Ukrainian official clarified that the swap was ongoing but not yet finished. Trump suggested that this development could lead to significant progress in resolving the conflict. While Moscow has not confirmed the exchange, reports indicate an agreement to hand over approximately 1,000 prisoners on each side. This exchange, agreed upon during recent peace talks in Turkey, marks a rare sign of potential progress in the ongoing war. </p>

          <p>Washington ‚Äî President Trump said Friday that Russia and Ukraine had carried out a large exchange of prisoners from their more than three-year war, while a Ukrainian official said the swap was ongoing but not yet complete. Moscow did not immediately confirm the exchange was underway but it appeared to be one of the few signs of any progress in international efforts to halt the fighting. "A major prisoners swap was just completed between Russia and Ukraine," Mr. Trump said on his Truth Social platform. </p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a significant rally following reports that President Trump plans to sign executive orders to support the nuclear industry. The orders are expected to expedite the construction of reactors and secure key materials, addressing U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium. The president is also expected to direct federal agencies to streamline the permitting and siting of new nuclear facilities. This move signals a strong endorsement of nuclear energy and is expected to boost the sector's growth. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined as President Trump's trade war rhetoric fueled market uncertainty and prompted investors to seek safety in bonds. Trump's proposal of a 50% tariff on EU imports and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. triggered concerns about the global economy. These moves followed a week of volatile trading in Treasurys, driven by concerns about the U.S. deficit and a credit rating downgrade. Investors are now assessing the potential impact of Trump's trade policies on economic growth and inflation. </p>
