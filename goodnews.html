Fans chanted his name, highlighting the enduring affection for "The Special One" from his previous successful stints. Mourinho, who shared a touching moment with a former Chelsea employee and intervened during a fan missile incident, acknowledged the deep connection he shares with the club and its supporters.

          <p>Palantir Technologies has seen its stock price surge over 1,700% since its 2020 NYSE debut, reaching a market cap of over $432 billion. The data analytics company, co-founded by Alex Karp, has expanded its customer base significantly, driven partly by its AI platform (AIP) launched in 2023. Despite controversies surrounding its government contracts and high valuation multiples, Palantir has secured major deals, including a $10 billion Army software contract. CEO Karp remains confident in the company's long-term position as a leading software provider, urging detractors to "exit" if they dislike the price. (not investment advice)</p>

He recommended consistent monthly investments and staying in the market through short-term fluctuations, allowing gains to compound. Cramer suggested including a speculative investment and an "insurance" investment like gold or cryptocurrency. He believes younger generations have unprecedented opportunities for significant returns, urging them to invest rather than merely trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a deal with Pfizer to sell discounted drugs directly to consumers through a new federal website, TrumpRx.gov, set to launch in 2026. This initiative is part of a broader effort to align U.S. drug prices with those in other developed countries, with Pfizer agreeing to charge the same price for new drugs globally. While touted as a significant reform, experts like Ameet Sarpatwari note that the discounts apply only to patients not using insurance and may not benefit average consumers significantly. The deal is seen by some as "window dressing" rather than a transformative solution to high drug costs.</p>

This move aims to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals, with Thacker Pass expected to become a major North American lithium source by late 2027. The investment is part of a broader White House strategy to gain direct ownership in mineral supply chains vital to U.S. interests.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly expanding the state's authority over workplace disputes and union elections. This legislation allows the California Public Employment Relations Board to intervene when the federal National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is unresponsive or paralyzed, as it has been since losing quorum. The bill aims to protect workers' rights to unionize and organize, creating a fund from civil penalties to support these new responsibilities. Proponents hail it as a landmark reform, while opponents raise concerns about potential conflicts with federal law.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is exploring a proposal to raise the minimum wage for residential construction workers to over $32 an hour, plus a healthcare credit. Council members argue this is necessary to attract and retain workers in an industry facing labor shortages, exacerbated by fears of immigration raids and the need to rebuild after the Palisades fire. Backed by unions and housing groups, the motion aims to protect often non-union, foreign-born workers vulnerable to wage theft. A study will assess the effects of establishing this new wage floor for projects with ten or more residential units.</p>
