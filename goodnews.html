          <p>The recent Canadian federal election brought considerable change, with 17% of seats switching parties, a significant increase from 7% in 2021. Several party leaders, including the Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, lost their seats, while the Liberal Party experienced a turnaround. The shift saw all 59 flipped seats going to either the Liberals or Conservatives, with the NDP losing parliamentary funding and facing challenges to their party status. This article highlights a reshaping of the Canadian political landscape, accounting for population changes and resulting in losses for smaller parties.</p>

          <p>Despite turbulence in global markets due to U.S. tariff policies, the UK's FTSE 100 has achieved its longest winning streak ever, gaining over 5% since the beginning of the year.

Analysts suggest the FTSE 100 has the potential to extend its record run, though uncertainties over U.S. trade policy could limit further gains. (not investment advice)</p>
