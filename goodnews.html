          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have surged in the first five months of the year, driven by consumer demand, offshore factory investments, and efforts to offset losses from high US tariffs. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have seen double-digit percentage increases compared to the same period in 2024. Analysts suggest that Chinese manufacturers are increasingly using Southeast Asian factories to produce finished goods for local and Western markets, including the US, in response to US import tariffs. This shift highlights the growing economic and investment ties between China and Southeast Asian countries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a massive reduction, particularly among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease in fatal overdoses. The latest available records show that fentanyl and other drugs killed more than 31,000 people under the age of 35 in 2021, but by last year, that number had plummeted to roughly 16,690 fatal overdoses. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as the wider distribution of Narcan, a trend of weaker fentanyl being sold, more readily available addiction healthcare, and less risky drug use among teens and young adults. The Trump administration's proposed cuts to funding for science and health agencies responding to the fentanyl crisis, however, pose a threat to this progress.</p>

          <p>Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei stated that the company's Ascend chips still lag behind those from the US ‚Äúby a generation‚Äù, but state-of-the-art performance can still be achieved by using other methods. Ren said that by using methods like ‚Äústacking and clustering, the computing results are comparable‚Äù to the most advanced programmes in the world. He added that China has many advantages in developing AI, including ‚Äúhundreds of millions of young people‚Äù in addition to ‚Äúsufficient electricity and a developed information network‚Äù.
