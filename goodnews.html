          <p>Oscar Piastri led the second practice session at the Spanish Grand Prix, with McLaren demonstrating strong pace. The talking point of the weekend is the new front-wing flexibility test introduced by the FIA, aimed at reducing teams' ability to use flexing wings to control aerodynamic performance. Teams have long used front-wing flexibility to boost speed on straights while retaining downforce in corners, but the new restrictions are intended to limit this practice. It remains to be seen whether the tougher tests will have a significant effect on teams like McLaren and Mercedes, who are perceived to have pioneered this approach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve indicating that interest rate cuts are unlikely in the near future, consumers should consider strategies to manage high borrowing costs. Experts recommend paying down credit card debt by switching to a zero-interest balance transfer card or consolidating with a lower-rate personal loan. Locking in high-yield savings rates before they decline and improving credit scores to qualify for lower interest rates are also advised. These steps can help consumers mitigate the impact of high interest rates and improve their financial standing (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In today's economy, characterized by high home equity levels and relatively low home equity borrowing rates, homeowners should carefully consider how much equity to borrow. Borrowers should assess their budget, repayment capacity, and economic outlook before deciding on an amount. It is recommended to borrow an amount that can be comfortably repaid over a shorter period to minimize interest costs. Borrowing too much equity can be risky, as the home serves as collateral and market conditions can impact repayment ability (not investment advice).</p>
