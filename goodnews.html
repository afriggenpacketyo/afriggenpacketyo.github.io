          <p>Lewis Pugh, a British-South African endurance athlete, became the first person to swim around Martha's Vineyard, completing the 62-mile feat in 12 days. Pugh undertook the swim to raise awareness about the plight of sharks and challenge the negative portrayal stemming from the film "Jaws," which was filmed in Edgartown. Enduring frigid waters and harsh weather, Pugh emphasized the need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 100 million sharks are killed annually. He was accompanied by safety personnel using a Shark Shield device and hopes to change public perception of these apex predators, essential for a healthy ocean.</p>

          <p>Jaxson Dart, the New York Giants' first-round draft pick, is reluctant to buy his preferred jersey number, No. 2, from cornerback Deonte Banks, deeming the price tag "too much." Banks acquired the number after a deal with Russell Wilson for No. 3. As the 25th overall pick, Dart is slated to earn $16.9 million over four years, including a $9 million signing bonus. Dart wore No. 6 at rookie minicamp, and last year, Drew Lock wore No. 2 in his single season with the Giants.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those by SpaceX, to understand the acoustics of spaceflight and its impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is causing disruptions. Researchers, led by Kent Gee at Brigham Young University, are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how atmospheric conditions affect sound propagation. Their work aims to address rocket noise issues before they become widespread, especially with the advent of larger and louder rockets like Starship.</p>

The article draws parallels between the early 1900s and the present, noting how politics, gender stereotypes, and infrastructure limitations affected electric car adoption. Republicans are pushing to eliminate subsidies and impose new fees on electric vehicles, while the oil industry continues to enjoy tax breaks. Despite these hurdles, advancements in technology could give electric vehicles a competitive edge in the future.</p>

With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance in save opportunities is crucial for the Dodgers.</p>
