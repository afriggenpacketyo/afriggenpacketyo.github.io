          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 00:44:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by robust growth in wealth management, global markets, and global banking sectors. The bank's profit before taxation reached $2.103 billion, a notable increase from the previous year. CEO Bill Winters highlighted the double-digit income growth in Wealth Solutions, Global Markets, and Global Banking, though the bank also faced a $219 million credit impairment charge due to rising rates affecting repayments. While the earnings don't fully reflect the impact of U.S. tariffs, Standard Chartered remains focused on high-growth markets in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and is currently undertaking a cost-saving initiative called "Fit for Growth."</p>

          <p>Local elections in parts of England are underway, with initial results indicating gains for Reform UK. The BBC predicts Andrea Jenkyns of Reform UK will likely become the first mayor of Greater Lincolnshire. Labour has retained several mayoralties, but Reform UK secured second place in all of them, with reduced Labour majorities in some areas. Early council results show Reform UK taking seats from both Conservatives and Labour. A recount is underway in the Westminster by-election in Runcorn and Helsby, where the result is extremely close between Labour and Reform.
