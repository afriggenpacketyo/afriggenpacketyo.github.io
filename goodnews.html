          <p>Jerry Ye, the Caltech alumnus and founder of Whale, an AI software company, discusses the impact of U.S.-China tensions on his global business, which includes clients like Starbucks and Unilever. He believes that while the U.S. and China will lead in AI application, they will do so in different ways, with China focusing on marketing and sales and the U.S. on niche sectors. Ye also addresses concerns about AI computing power shortages in China, stating that cloud companies provide sufficient resources, and on-device chips are becoming powerful enough for AI models while ensuring data privacy. He also touches on the challenge of complying with local data privacy and security needs in every region.</p>

          <p>Marc LeBlanc and Laura Robinson, hospitality professionals who have worked in destinations like the Maldives, Bali, and the Cayman Islands, share their experiences of living in paradise versus visiting as a tourist. They highlight the challenges of being "locked" on resort islands for extended periods, the unique dynamics of staff villages, and the maintenance issues caused by saltwater and humidity. The couple, now managing a luxury resort in Cambodia's Cardamom Mountains, emphasize the importance of employee well-being and community building in remote locations.

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable because existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself, a rare occurrence reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. This decision is likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a prolonged period of poor returns following the market peak in 2021. The company, which is behind the popular USDC stablecoin, did not provide a reason for its decision. The extended period of meager returns for venture capital firms has caused a strong desire by early investors to get some liquidity.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing concerns about ride comfort at ultra-high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation found that even minor imperfections in the track can cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. However, they have developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride "pronounced, but not unpleasant." The study used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to identify and mitigate these issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's actions against Harvard have created a sense of unity on campus, despite past divisions over the war in Gaza and free speech issues. The Department of Homeland Security barred Harvard from enrolling international students, leading to widespread condemnation and a lawsuit from the university. Students and faculty members have set aside differences to defend the university, with even conservative voices criticizing the administration's approach.

          <p>A judge struck down an executive order targeting WilmerHale, marking another legal victory for law firms resisting the Trump administration's efforts to control them. The order was deemed unconstitutional, with the judge asserting that it aimed to drive the firm to the bargaining table through severe sanctions. This ruling validates the strategy of fighting the administration instead of caving to pressure, and it follows similar rejections of punitive orders aimed at other firms. Despite the legal win, the judge noted that WilmerHale had already suffered business losses due to the president's actions.</p>
