          <p>During a San Francisco concert on her "The Lifetimes Tour," pop singer Katy Perry experienced a technical issue with an aerial prop. While performing her song "Roar" on a large mechanical butterfly, the prop unexpectedly dropped several feet, startling the artist but causing no injury. Perry quickly recovered and professionally finished the performance, later remarking, "Not today, Satan," as the song concluded. This incident is one of several recent examples of artists encountering malfunctions with complex stage equipment during live shows across the music industry.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 19:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is intensifying across the UK on whether to shorten the traditional six-week summer school holiday, with proponents arguing it could help close learning gaps and ease childcare burdens for working parents. Some school districts are already adopting a five-week summer break in favor of a longer two-week half-term in October. However, the proposal is divisive, with many teachers opposing the change, viewing the long break as essential for rest and preparation. The discussion also considers the potential economic impacts on holiday pricing and the challenges for employers managing staff leave requests.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest season of Iowa Public Radio's podcast "Unsettled" delves into the complex issue of gender inequality in the United States, with a specific focus on how men's roles and perspectives contribute to the problem. The series aims to examine the ways in which gender dynamics affect the daily lives of all people, moving beyond a singular focus on women's experiences. By investigating the male side of the gender gap equation, the podcast seeks to provide a more holistic understanding of the societal structures and attitudes that perpetuate these persistent disparities in American society.</p>

          <p>Former Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart is set to sign with the Los Angeles Lakers after agreeing to a contract buyout with the Washington Wizards. The 31-year-old guard is expected to sign a two-year, $11 million deal, providing the Lakers with a much-needed defensive specialist on the wing. Smart, known for his toughness and versatility, spent nine successful seasons with the Boston Celtics before brief stints in Memphis and Washington. His addition is seen as a key move to bolster the Lakers' perimeter defense alongside their offensive-minded backcourt.</p>

          <p>The LA Clippers are "strongly considering" signing veteran point guard Chris Paul, according to the team's president of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank. Paul, who is 40, previously played for the Clippers for six seasons, leading the memorable "Lob City" era. The potential signing aims to add more playmaking and ball-handling depth to the roster, which already includes guards like James Harden and the newly acquired Bradley Beal. Frank emphasized that any incoming player would need to accept a reserve role, as the team looks to build a versatile and deep roster.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges from water companies in half by the year 2030, marking the first time the government has set a specific target on the issue. This commitment comes in response to public outrage over record levels of pollution in the nation's rivers and coastlines, with serious incidents rising 60% in 2024. The plan also includes banning plastic-containing wet wipes and reducing phosphorus pollution. The announcement precedes a major review of the water industry, which faces scrutiny for its environmental performance amid rising consumer bills.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a dramatic and eventful third-round performance at The Open, keeping himself in contention with a score of 66 to reach eight under par. His round was highlighted by a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, which sent roars through the massive crowds at Royal Portrush. Despite a bizarre incident involving a buried golf ball and a costly bogey, McIlroy's strong finish has given him what he described as "half a chance" heading into the final day. He remains six shots behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler.</p>

          <p>Germany is shifting its foreign policy focus to build a stronger security and defense alliance with France and the United Kingdom, a partnership now known as the "E3." This move is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about the future of US security commitments to Europe under a potential Trump presidency. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz recently signed a comprehensive bilateral treaty with the UK, signaling a new era of cooperation. The E3 alliance aims to bolster European self-reliance, with the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK playing a central role.</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona is reportedly close to finalizing a deal to sign forward Marcus Rashford from Manchester United, where he has been out of favor with management. The transfer, expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, comes as Barcelona seeks to strengthen its attacking line after failing to sign other targets. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, Barcelona is betting on the 27-year-old's potential and vast top-level experience. For Manchester United, the move represents an opportunity to offload an unwanted high-profile player and reshape their squad.</p>

While the Lions' performance was strong initially, it faded as replacements came on, allowing Australia to score late tries and make the final scoreline more respectable. Pundits noted the Wallabies appeared undercooked, raising questions about the competitiveness of the remainder of the series.</p>

          <p>A recent report from Bank of America analysts makes a bold comparison, suggesting the development of quantum computing could be the most significant human breakthrough since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to solve endless complex calculations instantly, which could revolutionize fields from medicine and materials science to logistics and artificial intelligence. While major milestones have been achieved, practical, real-world applications are still hindered by the instability of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information.
