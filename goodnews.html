          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced impressive first earnings since its IPO, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company's revenue reached $981.6 million, exceeding the anticipated $853 million, fueled by a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation costs, CoreWeave projects strong revenue for the second quarter and the full year of 2025, driven by increasing demand for its Nvidia GPU rental services. The company's future growth hinges on securing sufficient power for its data centers, with 300 megawatts of contracted power added during the quarter.</p>

          <p>AMC Theatres is introducing a 50% discount on adult evening tickets on Wednesdays for AMC Stubs loyalty program members, starting July 9, aiming to increase attendance during the slower mid-week period. The move comes as theaters struggle to recover from pandemic-related declines, and follows discussions at CinemaCon about improving the theater experience. CEO Adam Aron cited improved box-office results in the fiscal second quarter as the reason for implementing the discount, with analysts suggesting it could drive attendance, increase concession sales, and expose audiences to trailers for new films. The article discusses that this initiative will test whether it cannibalizes higher-priced attendance on other days.</p>

          <p>A federal proposal to help families pay for private school tuition is one step closer to becoming a reality, as Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted to include a $20 billion federal school voucher program in the broader reconciliation bill.

The tax credit would be capped at $5 billion dollars in each of the next four years, from 2026 through 2029. Most students in the U.S. could qualify for a voucher, as the household income limit would be set at 300% of a given area's median gross income.</p>
