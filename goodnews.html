          <p>Everton has successfully completed the acquisition of France Under-21 striker Thierno Barry from Villarreal for a reported £27 million, with the player signing a four-year contract extending until June 2029. The 22-year-old forward was instrumental for Villarreal last season, contributing 11 goals and four assists in 38 appearances, which helped the Spanish club secure a Champions League qualification. Barry's signing is expected to significantly bolster Everton's offensive capabilities, filling the void left by the recent departures of Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Armando Broja. He expressed enthusiasm about joining a prominent Premier League club, acknowledging its historical significance and the legacy of notable players who have represented the team.</p>

          <h2>Chang’e-6 Mission Reveals Asteroid Impact Altered Moon’s Far-Side Mantle</h2>

          <p>China's Chang’e-6 lunar mission has delivered groundbreaking scientific findings, indicating that a colossal asteroid impact over 4 billion years ago profoundly altered the moon’s far-side mantle. Published in four open-access papers in Nature, the research suggests this collision, which formed the solar system's largest crater, stripped the moon's deep interior of vital chemical components. Subsequent volcanic activity from this damaged mantle produced volcanic rocks notably depleted in elements like titanium and thorium, making them the most chemically depleted lunar samples ever analyzed. These unique samples from the moon's unexplored far side provide unprecedented insights into its early geological history and evolution.</p>

          <p>Presidents from Senegal, Liberia, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania, and Gabon are participating in a mini-summit in Washington, hosted by President Trump, aimed at deepening commercial opportunities between the U.S. and African nations. This gathering signals a strategic pivot by the Trump administration from traditional aid to fostering economic partnerships on the continent, potentially eyeing critical resources such as Gabon's manganese and uranium. The summit unfolds amidst increasing U.S. apprehension regarding China's expanding economic and military footprint in Africa, including unconfirmed reports of Beijing seeking port locations for military purposes. This engagement also highlights the diminishing U.S. military presence in the Sahel region, contrasting with the growing influence of both China and Russia.</p>

          <p>Renowned Dutch art detective Arthur Brand, often dubbed the "Indiana Jones of the Art World," has successfully recovered a priceless trove of stolen documents spanning the 15th to 19th centuries, including UNESCO-listed archives from the Dutch East India Company (VOC). This significant find, stolen in 2015 from the National Archives in The Hague, offers a captivating insight into early modern global history, featuring records of the world's first multinational corporation and personal ship logs of famous Admiral Michiel de Ruyter. Brand's investigation began with an anonymous email, leading him to a box of manuscripts left as collateral by a now-deceased suspect, marking one of the most remarkable recoveries of his career.</p>

          <p>BNY Mellon, recognized as the nation's oldest bank, has announced it will act as the primary custodian for the reserves backing Ripple's new U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. This strategic collaboration is expected to significantly bolster regulatory compliance and enhance institutional credibility for both Ripple and the rapidly expanding stablecoin sector, which is currently experiencing a "stablecoin summer." The development highlights a growing trend of interest from established financial institutions and major corporations, including Amazon and Walmart, in stablecoins. This shift is occurring as the Trump administration relaxes previous crypto policies and Congress advances stablecoin legislation. Ripple is also pursuing a U.S. national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French football club Lyon has successfully appealed the decision to relegate them, thereby securing their position in Ligue 1 for the forthcoming season. Previously, French football authorities had moved to demote the seven-time champions to Ligue 2, citing concerns over their poor financial health. This overturned ruling not only guarantees Lyon's continued participation in France's top flight but also significantly impacts the Europa League qualification hopes of other clubs, particularly Crystal Palace, whose fate was linked to Lyon's original status. Lyon's official statement expressed satisfaction with the decision, highlighting the new management's dedication to responsible financial practices and allowing the club to now fully concentrate on its sporting goals.</p>

          <p>Patrick Bailey of the San Francisco Giants etched his name into Major League Baseball history on Tuesday night by hitting a walk-off inside-the-park home run, clinching a thrilling 4-3 victory against the Phillies. This exceptionally rare three-run shot, which bounced off the brick wall in Triples Alley, allowed Bailey to complete his circuit around the bases, securing the win and sparking a joyous mob scene at home plate. It marked the ninth time this season the Giants have won in their final at-bat and only the third instance of a catcher hitting a game-ending inside-the-park home run in major league history. Despite the unique and exciting nature of the play, a visibly tired Bailey quipped that he would have preferred a traditional home run.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially ended its long-standing "shoes-off" rule, enabling the majority of travelers to keep their footwear on while passing through airport security checkpoints. This significant policy alteration, which became effective on Tuesday, is designed to reduce wait times and enhance the efficiency of the air travel process for all passengers, extending the convenience previously limited to TSA PreCheck members. The original mandate was implemented in 2006 after a foiled shoe-bombing attempt in 2001. Although the new policy is widely applicable, TSA officers maintain the discretion to request shoe removal for additional screening if deemed necessary. Industry advocacy groups, such as the U.S. Travel Association, have lauded this change as a major improvement for travelers.</p>

          <p>Mondelēz Global LLC, the parent company of Ritz crackers, has initiated a nationwide recall for four specific carton sizes of its Ritz Peanut Butter Cracker Sandwiches. The recall stems from an incorrect labeling issue, where some individually wrapped packs within these cartons may be erroneously labeled as "cheese" crackers, thereby posing a significant health risk to individuals with peanut allergies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning, emphasizing that consumption of these mislabeled products could trigger serious or potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. While no related illnesses have been reported to date, health officials strongly advise consumers with peanut allergies to immediately dispose of any affected products to ensure their safety.</p>

This crowded venue, distinctively adorned with American and Arab pop culture memorabilia, welcomed revelers, including young Syrian activists who had returned from Beirut. The ambiance was proudly Syrian and Arab, exclusively featuring Arabic music, including previously suppressed anti-Assad songs. While the night was dedicated to joyous dancing and celebration, an underlying apprehension persisted among attendees regarding the potential for Islamist groups, who spearheaded the revolt, to impose restrictions on such freedoms, underscoring the fragile equilibrium between post-conflict jubilation and future uncertainties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While not directly targeting China, analysts propose that President Donald Trump’s comprehensive "One Big Beautiful Bill" could inadvertently present opportunities for Beijing. This far-reaching act, encompassing permanent tax cuts, a substantial increase in Washington's debt limit, and significant cuts to healthcare funding, is projected to dramatically surge the U.S. federal deficit. Experts suggest that such fiscal shifts could reconfigure global capital flows by diminishing incentives for U.S. multinational corporations to retain profits and investments overseas. Moreover, should the bill lead to increased political instability within the U.S. or inflict damage upon domestic sectors like the clean energy industry, China might strategically capitalize on these vulnerabilities, despite the bill's primary domestic focus.
