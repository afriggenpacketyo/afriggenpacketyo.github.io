          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The workers were located approximately six miles from the tunnel's access point and had to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape. None of the individuals sustained any visible injuries during the incident. The collapse occurred at the site of the Clearwater Project, a multi-million dollar initiative to repair aging wastewater tunnels, which has now been placed on an indefinite hold pending a Cal/OSHA investigation into the cause.</p>

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has stated he would fully support Auburn men's basketball coach Bruce Pearl if he decides to run for the U.S. Senate. While Barkley hopes Pearl remains with the team, he respects the coach's right to pursue a political career. Pearl, who is Jewish, has become more politically prominent for his vocal support of Israel and President Trump's handling of Middle East conflicts. Barkley emphasized that his support for Pearl is independent of the coach's political affiliations, highlighting their personal trust and respect.</p>

          <p>Kenneth A. Bianchi, one of two men behind the infamous 'Hillside Strangler' serial murders in the 1970s, has been denied parole. The California Board of Parole Hearings ruled that the 74-year-old will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were convicted for the sexual assault, torture, and murder of 12 women in Los Angeles and Washington state while impersonating police officers. Bianchi pleaded guilty and testified against Buono, who was sentenced to life without parole and died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite named NWA 16788, with an expected price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, was discovered in Niger in 2023 after traveling 140 million miles through space. Martian meteorites are exceedingly rare, comprising only about 0.6% of all meteorites found on Earth. The auction house is promoting the object not just as a collector's item but as a significant dataset that could help scientists better understand the red planet.</p>

          <h2>Denver Dinosaur Museum Discovers Fossil Beneath Its Own Parking Lot</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science has made an exceptionally rare fossil discovery directly on its property. A vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur, estimated to be 67.5 million years old, was found within a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep under the museum's parking lot. The drilling was part of a study on geothermal heating potential, making the find completely unexpected. Museum officials described the discovery as incredibly unlikely, akin to a 'hole in one from the moon,' and have put the hockey-puck-shaped fossil on display for the public.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump at the White House, a significant event that coincided with his company becoming the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the meeting's agenda was not disclosed, it occurs as Nvidia grapples with Trump administration export controls on its advanced AI chips to China for national security reasons. These restrictions have effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the Chinese market, which Huang previously stated would result in missing $8 billion in planned orders for its July quarter.</p>

          <p>The iconic red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning again, 14 months after they were knocked down by high winds. The restoration was celebrated with a street performance by 60 dancers performing the can-can and a fireworks display from the cabaret's roof. The original collapse in April 2024 was caused by a failure in the central axis, but no one was injured. The restoration of the famous landmark, immortalized by artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and a 2001 film, marks the return of a key symbol of Parisian nightlife.</p>

          <h2>Political Strategist Identifies Eight Key Words for Winning Campaign Slogans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans by studying 20,000 campaign messages worldwide. The research suggests eight words consistently resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. These words are described as 'emotional shortcuts' that can serve as building blocks for campaign messaging. The article notes that while these words are powerful, they are not a guarantee of success and must be paired with a compelling candidate and popular policies.</p>

The Austin pilot has encountered some issues, including minor accidents and traffic violations that have attracted regulatory attention.</p>

          <p>Denim maker Levi Strauss reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year sales and profit guidance. The company's sales grew 6%, driven by strong demand and 11% growth in its direct-to-consumer channels. CEO Michelle Gass noted that strong international business, which accounts for 60% of sales, helps insulate the company from U.S. tariffs. For now, Levi's plans to absorb the estimated $25-$30 million impact from tariffs, aided by reduced promotions and premium pricing on new products, as executives expressed confidence in consumer resilience.</p>
