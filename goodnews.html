          <p>Author Philip Pullman is calling on the UK government to update copyright laws regarding AI "scraping," where AI software uses writers' books to train language models without compensation or recognition. Pullman argues that writers should be paid if their work is used, deeming the current system "wicked" and immoral. He emphasizes the need for the government to act swiftly to protect writers' rights against the unauthorized use of their creative work by AI developers. Pullman's call to action comes amid growing concerns about the impact of AI on creative industries and the need for fair compensation for artists. It's a critical issue that demands immediate attention. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a general decline as investors analyzed Japan's latest trade data and the country's new political leadership. Japan's exports saw a slight increase, but fell short of expectations, while imports also rose. Sanae Takaichi was sworn in as Prime Minister, leading to market fluctuations, including a significant drop in SoftBank shares before recovering slightly. South Korea's markets showed resilience, bucking the regional trend with gains in the Kospi and Kosdaq indices. This reflects investor reaction to economic indicators and political developments in the region. </p>

          <p>Airbus has inaugurated its second assembly line in Tianjin, China, aiming to boost manufacturing capacity for its A320neo family of jets. The new facility is expected to be fully operational by early 2026, marking Airbus's 10th final assembly line globally. This expansion follows the opening of another assembly line in Mobile, Alabama, reflecting Airbus's strategy to navigate trade tensions between China and the United States. Airbus's CEO met with Chinese officials, emphasizing the company's commitment to expanding its presence in China and strengthening trade ties. The move underscores Airbus's global growth strategy. </p>

          <p>National Guard troops are expected to deploy to New Orleans by late November, according to Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick, to support security efforts during major events. The deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, will cover the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. This decision follows a previous deployment after a terror attack on Bourbon Street earlier in the year and aims to enhance public safety during large gatherings. While acknowledging the police department's understaffing, Kirkpatrick clarified that the National Guard's role is to support law enforcement, not to engage in enemy combat. The city is also expecting 20 new police officers to graduate from the academy soon. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is grappling with a surge in copper wire thefts, leaving communities without streetlights and impacting public safety. A new statewide metal theft law aims to curb the problem by targeting recyclers who purchase stolen metal, requiring them to verify the seller's identity and lawful ownership. The thefts have caused significant financial losses and safety concerns, exemplified by the darkened Sixth Street Bridge and ongoing streetlight outages. City leaders are seeking funding to address the issue, while residents are taking measures into their own hands by installing private lighting. The new law is intended to reduce theft and improve public safety. </p>

          <p>Samsung and Google have partnered to introduce the Galaxy XR, an AI-powered headset aimed at disrupting the smartphone market and challenging Apple's Vision Pro. Priced at $1,800, the Galaxy XR offers an immersive virtual computing experience with hand gesture and voice controls, powered by Google's Gemini AI assistant. The headset is seen as a stepping stone to future AI glasses developed with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, leveraging Gemini for tasks like organizing virtual workspaces and generating videos. However, the reliance on cloud-based Gemini raises privacy concerns, as user data is transmitted to Google's servers. The article questions whether AI-powered glasses can replace smartphones. </p>

          <p>Japanese exports experienced a rebound in September, climbing 4.2% year on year, driven by strong shipments to Asia. However, exports to the U.S. continued to decline, offsetting some of the gains. Semiconductor exports were a key driver of overall growth, while auto shipments to the U.S. also decreased. The trade data comes after Japan appointed its first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, whose policies are expected to weaken the yen and benefit exporters. The country's economy has performed better than anticipated, with upward revisions to its second-quarter GDP. </p>

          <p>The government is proposing changes to make fining English water companies for sewage spills quicker and easier. New proposals include automatic fines of up to £20,000 for minor offenses and a simplified process for punishing more serious violations. The Environment Agency (EA) has struggled to take action despite data showing frequent breaches of sewage spill regulations. The government hopes the new system will incentivize water companies to improve their practices, with fines to be covered by shareholders, not customers. The proposals will undergo a six-week public consultation. </p>
