          <p>The British government has announced a new partnership with supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage customers to make healthier food choices. Under the voluntary plan, businesses will decide how to promote healthy eating, potentially through special offers, revised loyalty programs, or changes to in-store layouts. The initiative aims to tackle rising obesity rates by making nutritious options more accessible, though some critics question the effectiveness of a plan that does not impose specific, mandatory targets on the industry.</p>

          <p>A new pilot initiative in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future skin cancer rates. The program educates students on reading UV indexes, applying sunscreen correctly, and understanding when protection is necessary. With melanoma cases projected to rise, health experts and the charity behind the project emphasize that instilling good habits in childhood is critical, as early-life sunburns significantly increase the risk of developing skin cancer later.</p>
