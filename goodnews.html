          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, drawing renewed interest from both overseas and domestic retail investors. With an estimated US$22 trillion in savings, Chinese investors are rotating out of low-yield fixed-income products and into stocks, providing a powerful catalyst for the market. Global asset managers are turning positive on Chinese equities, citing "undervalued innovation" in sectors like advanced manufacturing and AI. This shift suggests potential for continued growth as international capital returns to the nation's combined US$20 trillion markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's actions were unlawful. The judges found that the Department of Homeland Security secretary lacked the authority to vacate a prior extension of TPS. This decision provides temporary relief for individuals who were facing the loss of their permission to live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has been testifying in a civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, a claim she denies. Her animated and candid responses on the witness stand have gone viral, with moments of her testimony being compared to comedy skits. The trial has featured unusual lines of questioning from lawyers, including inquiries about her wigs and fingernails, which have baffled and amused online observers. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleges the rapper cut her cheek and spit on her, while Cardi B maintains the confrontation was only verbal after her privacy was invaded.</p>

          <p>Following the engagement announcement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, wedding industry experts are speculating about what the high-profile event might entail. Planners suggest the couple will likely opt for an intimate and meaningful location, possibly a private estate, rather than a typical large venue, with a focus on tight security and confidentiality. Given Swift's history of being deeply involved in her creative projects, she is expected to take a hands-on approach to the planning. For her dress, experts predict a romantic and statement-making gown, potentially from an international designer, reflecting her refined red-carpet style.</p>

          <p>Frankie Muniz, the former "Malcolm in the Middle" star who is now a NASCAR driver, has withdrawn from an upcoming race at Darlington Raceway after breaking his wrist. Muniz revealed on social media that he fell off a ladder at his home while trying to change batteries in a security camera. Despite joking about the incident, he expressed his disappointment at missing the competition but is grateful the injury wasn't more severe. This is not the first injury for the actor-turned-racer, who has described himself as "injury-prone" and has recovered from more serious crashes in the past.</p>

          <p>As Prince Harry prepares for a return visit to the UK, there are indications of a potential thaw in his strained relationship with his father, King Charles III. Unlike his last visit, the King will be in the country, creating an opportunity for a meeting. Recent developments, including a reported meeting between their respective communication teams, suggest a mutual desire to improve the situation. With Harry's court case over security now concluded, a major source of tension has been removed, potentially paving the way for reconciliation, though trust remains a significant hurdle for the family.</p>

          <p>China is streamlining its State Key Laboratories (SKLs), including those in Hong Kong, to better serve its national strategic agenda and competition in the global technology race. The restructuring moves away from loosely defined research towards a model with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's goals for scientific supremacy. During a recent ceremony in Hong Kong, China's Science and Technology Minister emphasized the city's role in supporting national development through innovation. This new approach aims to transform the labs into more focused and efficient engines for technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the backlash surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. In an interview, Carpenter expressed shock at the controversy, stating that her artistic intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it from a woman's perspective. After the initial criticism, she released an alternative cover that she humorously noted was "approved by God." Carpenter defended her original vision, emphasizing that it's about the humanity of making mistakes and learning from them.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive third-round loss to Elena Rybakina at the U.S. Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu believes the world's best players are extra motivated against her. All four of her Grand Slam defeats this year have been against top-ranked opponents, who she says seem to have a "point to prove" when they face her. Raducanu is focused on closing the gap, working with new coach Francisco Roig to improve key areas of her game, particularly her serve and the shot that follows it. Despite the tough losses, she feels she is improving and gaining respect on the tour.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg to protest severe budget cuts to public transportation. He is highlighting the inaction of the Republican-led state senate, which he says has failed to pass bipartisan funding proposals for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). The funding crisis has already led to service cuts affecting thousands of commuters, students, and elderly residents. Kenyatta's solo march aims to draw public attention to the issue and what he calls the disparate priorities of the two parties.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB and Pure Storage, experienced a massive stock rally, indicating that the financial benefits of the AI boom are extending beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. MongoDB's stock had its best week on record after reporting strong revenue growth and customer acquisition, driven partly by AI-native companies. Similarly, data storage vendor Pure Storage soared after reporting strong results and highlighting a major new contract with Meta to manage its AI-related storage needs. The performance suggests growing investor confidence that AI will be a significant tailwind for the broader software sector. (not investment advice)</p>
