          <p>Junior Alvarado, the jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory at the Kentucky Derby, has been fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days for excessive use of his riding crop. The Kentucky Board of Stewards determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times, exceeding the HISA rule limit of six. This marked Alvarado's second violation within 180 days, leading to a doubled fine under the escalating penalty structure. Sovereignty, owned by Godolphin, will not run in the Preakness Stakes but is expected to compete in the Belmont Stakes.</p>
