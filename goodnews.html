          <p>Design software company Figma announced a 41% year-over-year revenue increase in its first quarterly earnings report since its initial public offering, reaching $249.6 million and narrowly beating expectations. Despite the strong revenue growth and a reported net income of $846,000, the company's stock declined in extended trading. Figma provided an optimistic forecast for the third quarter and the full year, projecting revenue above analyst consensus. The company also highlighted recent acquisitions and the launch of new AI-powered tools, expressing confidence that artificial intelligence will enhance, not replace, the role of designers.

          <p>As the price of gold surged to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, the value of gold bars sold by retailers like Costco has significantly increased. An ounce of gold purchased a year ago for about $2,679 has seen an unrealized gain of over 32%, driven by investor uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions. However, the article notes that realizing these profits involves deductions from dealer fees and taxes. The IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible, subjecting long-term gains to a tax rate of up to 28%, which can substantially reduce the final return for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI is increasing its secondary share sale for employees from an initial $6 billion to approximately $10.3 billion. The sale values the company at $500 billion, a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. This transaction allows eligible current and former employees to sell a portion of their equity, providing liquidity without the pressure of an immediate public offering. Major investors, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and T. Rowe Price, are participating in the purchase. This move aligns with a trend among high-value tech startups to use secondary sales for employee retention and compensation.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence from whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, a first for the state's court system. This decision is a significant victory for prosecutors, as the technology linked Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on the remains of six victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab that conducted the testing is not licensed in New York, with a decision on that challenge expected later this month. This case could revolutionize how forensic evidence from degraded samples is used in criminal investigations statewide.</p>

After a meeting with MFE CEO Pier Silvio Berlusconi, Germany's Minister of State for Culture confirmed an agreement on preserving editorial independence, a key concern for the German government. MFE plans to strengthen Munich as a media hub and produce more localized German content, aiming to build a pan-European competitor to streaming giants like Netflix. The takeover, which had already been cleared by Bavarian regulators, is seen as a way to stabilize ProSiebenSat1 financially amid declining ad revenues.</p>

          <p>Reform UK national leader Nigel Farage has stated he will speak with Mick Barton, the leader of the Reform UK-led Nottinghamshire County Council, regarding Barton's decision to ban contact with a local newspaper. The ban on the Nottingham Post followed a disagreement over a story about local government reorganization. Farage, positioning himself as a "peacemaker," indicated he would discuss the matter with Barton at the upcoming party conference to find a solution. The ban has been criticized by the newspaper's editor and prompted a petition for press freedom that has garnered over 26,000 signatures.</p>

This exploration of advanced transit options is part of a broader effort to improve connectivity between the city's major visitor hubs, spurred by Disney's expansion and the development of the OC Vibe entertainment district. While the city is also evaluating other technologies like driverless shuttles, a study commissioned from a gondola company pitched unique designs, such as towers resembling the stadium's iconic "Big A" landmark. The potential cost and feasibility of the project are still in the early stages of evaluation.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.4 billion, the fifth-largest in the game's history, after 40 consecutive drawings without a winner. As players anticipate the next drawing, data analysis reveals how state taxes significantly impact the final take-home amount for winners. States with no income tax, such as Florida and Texas, offer the highest potential payout, while winners in high-tax states like New York would receive considerably less. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceedingly low at 1 in 292.2 million. The article also details which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently in recent drawings.</p>

The provision, part of a recent tax bill, allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips from their taxable income annually from 2025 through 2028. The tax break begins to phase out for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income over $150,000. The official proposed list will be published later for public comment, but this initial release provides early guidance for workers in service industries on who can expect to benefit from the new tax law.</p>

His remains were recovered from the wreckage in 1957 but could not be identified at the time. Using modern DNA analysis and other forensic methods, scientists were able to confirm his identity in March 2025, allowing for his burial in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The court ruled that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the legal standard required to invoke the wartime law. The administration had used the act to deport hundreds of individuals accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, though the government can still seek to remove the migrants under other legal authorities. The White House has indicated it will continue to fight the decision.</p>

          <p>A new report from a Washington-based think tank argues that the U.S. should de-escalate its rhetoric regarding the threat of a mainland Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors contend that strategic, political, and military factors make such an attack unlikely and that Washington's current posture of "threat inflation" is counterproductive. This analysis comes as the U.S. Congress finalizes its annual defense bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China. The report challenges the prevailing narrative that an invasion is imminent, suggesting a reduction in defense investments based on that premise would be a more prudent approach.</p>
