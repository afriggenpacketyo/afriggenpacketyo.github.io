          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2bn of investment to build the new Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, ahead of the Spending Review. Sizewell C is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs, thousands more in firms supplying the plant, and generate enough energy to power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a "landmark" that would "kickstart" economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment was necessary to usher in a "golden age of clean energy".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have seen a significant decline, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 plummeting from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year, according to provisional CDC data. This shift is attributed to factors including wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more accessible addiction healthcare, and a possible shift in drug use among teens and young adults. While the improvement is dramatic, experts caution that sustaining progress may be difficult, as many still struggle with addiction and face potential cuts to addiction services.</p>
