          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 11:36:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as B2B2C, or "tariff hacking," to reduce the financial impact of trade war tariffs on consumers. This model involves routing online sales through a middleman company that purchases goods at a wholesale price, thereby paying a lower tariff than would be assessed on the final retail price. While this method has helped brands like Yours Clothing and Tod's Group avoid raising prices, some logistics experts warn it may be a short-term solution that could attract future regulatory scrutiny. The strategy highlights the creative measures businesses are taking to navigate complex global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Indiana Fever secured their first playoff series victory in ten years, defeating the Atlanta Dream 87-85 in a decisive Game 3, despite the absence of star player Caitlin Clark due to a season-ending injury. Aliyah Boston scored the game-winning basket with just 7.4 seconds remaining, capping a 7-0 run to close out the game. The victory was a significant achievement for the team, which many had counted out after Clark was sidelined.

Prominent figures, including Charlotte Knobloch, president of the Jewish Community of Munich, have warned that the Middle East conflict is being used as a pretext to fuel hatred.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a crucial phone call to finalize a deal regarding the future of TikTok in the United States. The conversation follows the establishment of a "framework" agreement aimed at preventing a U.S. ban on the popular social media app. The federal law requires TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American operations due to national security concerns. President Trump, who has expressed a desire to keep the platform operational, recently extended the deadline for divestment to December 16.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has clarified that the recent $100 price hike on the new iPhone 17 Pro model is not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from the new iPhone's launch event, Cook explained that the company has been actively mitigating tariff impacts by shifting its supply chain to import from countries like India and Vietnam. This strategy aims to avoid passing tariff-related costs on to consumers. The company has previously acknowledged taking a significant financial hit from tariffs but is positioning its current pricing as independent of these trade policies.</p>

          <p>Baseball fans hoping to watch what could be Clayton Kershaw's final home game at Dodger Stadium will need a subscription to Apple TV+, as the streaming service holds the exclusive broadcast rights for the Friday night game. This arrangement is part of a larger deal between Apple and Major League Baseball for a package of Friday games. The situation has drawn attention as the celebrated Dodgers pitcher recently announced his retirement at the end of the season. This is not the first time a significant Dodgers moment was exclusive to the platform, as Albert Pujols' 700th home run was also on an Apple broadcast.</p>

          <p>The future of TikTok in the U.S. may depend on a licensing deal for its powerful and closely guarded algorithm, which has been a major point of contention in negotiations between Washington and Beijing. While China previously vowed to block the sale of the algorithm, recent statements suggest a potential softening, with officials mentioning an agreement on "the use of intellectual property rights." A licensing arrangement could allow a new U.S. entity to use the recommendation engine while ByteDance retains some ownership, though this may not fully resolve national security concerns about data access and content manipulation.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department and the IRS have released proposed regulations for President Trump's "no tax on tips" policy, which was enacted in July. The provision allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from 2025 to 2028, with the benefit phasing out for those with incomes over $150,000. Officials clarified that automatic gratuities will not qualify for the deduction because they are not voluntary payments. Additionally, workers in certain "specified service" fields like healthcare, legal, and financial services will be ineligible for the tax break. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Friday practice for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, narrowly ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc, while McLaren's Lando Norris had a "costly" session after crashing into a wall. The incident at Turn Four broke Norris's rear suspension, preventing him from completing his high-fuel race simulation runs and leaving him 10th fastest. The session was also challenging for Norris's teammate Oscar Piastri, who finished 12th. Despite the practice results, McLaren is expected to remain competitive over the weekend as they look to clinch the constructors' championship.</p>

Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders, and while the navy can assist if needed, the military's primary focus is on national defense.

The Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any such training would occur on Polish territory.

The album features bracingly honest lyrics that address her recent divorce from rapper Offset and an ongoing feud with fellow artist Bia. Critics have praised the record as a "fittingly grand return," with the artist settling scores and reasserting her place in the music industry. The album's title is inspired by a popular meme, reflecting the artist's chaotic and headline-grabbing public persona over the past seven years.</p>
