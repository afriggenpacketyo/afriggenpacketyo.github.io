          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 10:38:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has successfully restored water flow to over 9,000 residents in the San Fernando Valley communities of Granada Hills and Porter Ranch. The disruption was caused by the failure of a valve installed in 1967 during repairs at a local pump station. Although service is back, a boil water notice remains in effect, advising residents to use boiled or bottled water for drinking and cooking until water quality testing is complete. The repair was complex, as workers had to navigate around other utility lines, including fiber-optic cables and a high-pressure gas line, to access the broken valve.</p>

          <p>Business academic Suzy Welch proposes that long-term success, beyond luck, is a function of what she calls the PIE model: Personal relationships, Ideas, and Execution. The article emphasizes building genuine friendships over transactional networking, as these connections provide more meaningful support. It also highlights the need for a few original ideas, which can be small but impactful, and stresses that the ability to execute plans is a highly underrated and sought-after skill. The piece suggests that focusing on these three areas, rather than conforming to a specific definition of leadership, allows individuals to build a successful and authentic career.</p>

          <p>Renowned venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's demand for his resignation over alleged conflicts of interest. In an opinion piece, Moritz, who has known Tan for decades, called Trump's attack "artless bullying" and a "vindictive political sideshow" without modern precedent. He praised Tan's past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems and asserted that no one is better equipped to lead Intel's transformation. The Intel board's response is being watched as a test of corporate defiance against political pressure, with Tan scheduled to visit the White House to address concerns.</p>

          <p>Gary Grant, founder of the UK's largest independent toy retailer, The Entertainer, is transferring 100% ownership of the multi-million pound business to his 1,900 employees. The company, which started as a single shop in 1981, will now be run as an employee ownership trust, allowing staff to receive a share of the profits and have a say in its governance. Grant stated the move preserves the family's legacy and the company's Christian-based values, which include donating 10% of profits to charity and not opening on Sundays. This decision ensures the business is not sold purely for monetary gain and rewards the long-serving staff.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has indicated he is not yet ready to name a starting quarterback for Week 1, fueling speculation following an impressive preseason performance by rookie Shedeur Sanders. In his debut, Sanders threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns, turning heads and adding to the team's quarterback intrigue. While veteran Joe Flacco is considered the likely starter due to his experience, Stefanski declined to name a starter for the next preseason game. The team is currently managing a crowded quarterback room, with five active players in training camp while Deshaun Watson remains on injured reserve.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market has experienced a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price rising over 1% to $119,782, approaching its all-time high. Ether also saw a surge, briefly touching levels not seen since 2021 after breaking the $4,000 resistance level. This upward movement in digital assets has been accompanied by gains in related stocks, including Coinbase and various crypto mining companies. Analysts suggest the surge is fueled by increased buying during Asian trading hours, driven by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which is seen as a tailwind for hard assets like Bitcoin.

          <p>Following a significant rally that saw gold prices exceed $3,400 per ounce, the momentum has recently slowed, prompting questions about its future trajectory. Several precious metals experts suggest this is a consolidation phase rather than the end of the surge, citing strong institutional demand and the metal's role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. They point to record-level purchasing by central banks and gold's effectiveness as a portfolio diversifier as reasons for continued optimism. The analysis indicates that structural factors may support higher prices in the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of Malawi's upcoming election, several presidential candidates have nominated women as their running mates, prompting a debate on whether this signals a genuine shift towards gender inclusion in politics. With women comprising 57% of registered voters, the move is seen by some as a strategic appeal, while others are skeptical, suggesting it may be a token gesture. Political analysts note that most of these parties are smaller and that the running mates are in subordinate roles. Despite this, the development is considered a step in the right direction for a country where female representation in parliament is around 20%, though progress has been made in local government.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, has been found alive after being missing for nine days in the wilderness of British Columbia, Canada. Barber survived after his truck broke down by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and signaling for help by etching "help" on a rock and drawing "SOS" in the mud. A police helicopter spotted his truck on a forest road, which narrowed the search area and led to his rescue. He was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is reportedly doing well after being hospitalized. Search and rescue officials believe he may not have survived another 24 hours without being found.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but expected to cut them later in the year, a financial analyst advises savers to lock in current high yields on their cash. Options include high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer rates over 4%, and certificates of deposit (CDs), which provide a fixed rate for a set term. The article notes that while savings account rates will fall with any Fed cut, a CD allows savers to secure today's higher rates for a longer period. The piece suggests a strategy of laddering CDs with different maturities to balance accessibility and high returns before the opportunity diminishes. (not investment advice)</p>

While only a small fraction of U.S. households, approximately 163,000 as of 2023, still use dial-up, the decision represents a final disconnection from the early days of the commercial internet.

The 29-year-old playmaker, who joined City for a record £100m in 2021, made only seven league starts last season and was excluded from key squads. The move to Everton, while not offering European football, provides Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career with regular playing time at the club's new stadium.

          <p>Money psychology expert Morgan Housel and legendary investor Warren Buffett both advocate for a simple, long-term investing approach over complex strategies. Housel argues that many intelligent investors overcomplicate their approach, which often leads to worse results. Instead, he suggests that earning average market returns consistently over a long period, such as through low-cost index funds, is the key to building significant wealth. This passive investing strategy is echoed by Buffett, who has long advised that most investors will outperform professionals by periodically investing in a diversified, low-cost S&P 500 index fund rather than trying to pick individual winning stocks.

This deal marks a significant shift by eliminating the pay-per-view model for UFC's marquee events, making all content available to subscribers for a standard monthly fee.

Instead, the central bank now employs a diverse toolkit to manage volatility while allowing for more market-based pricing.
