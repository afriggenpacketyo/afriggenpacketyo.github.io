          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has reiterated his support for lowering interest rates but emphasized the need for a cautious and deliberate approach. He cited conflicting economic signals, such as a potentially weakening labor market alongside strong GDP growth and persistent inflation, as reasons for careful policy adjustments. Waller indicated he is comfortable with the current pace of two more quarter-point cuts by year-end but warned against more aggressive action until the economic trajectory becomes clearer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management, the most significant error young investors make is prioritizing downside protection over potential upside growth by avoiding the stock market. He argues that due to their long time horizon, young people should be fully invested in stocks to leverage the power of long-term compounding, which historically outperforms cash and bonds. For beginners, Brown recommends using low-cost, broad-market index funds or ETFs to build a diversified portfolio before considering other investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Look Back at Edgar Davids' Unconventional Tenure as Player-Manager at Barnet FC</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the memorable and bizarre period when Dutch football legend Edgar Davids served as player-manager for Barnet FC, starting in 2012. Despite his decorated career, Davids joined the struggling League Two club, bringing a Champions League-winning mentality that clashed with the lower-league environment, famously insisting players call him 'Sir'. His tenure was marked by on-field intensity, multiple red cards, wearing the number 1 jersey, and eventually skipping some away games, yet he is still remembered fondly for nearly saving the team from relegation.</p>

          <p>Costco has quietly emerged as a powerhouse in the apparel industry, with its clothing sales growing nearly 40% since 2019 to an estimated $9.7 billion annually. This revenue surpasses that of established retailers like Abercrombie & Fitch and Old Navy, driven by a strategy of offering popular brands alongside its private Kirkland Signature label. The company's success is attributed to its direct partnerships with manufacturers and "opportunistic" bulk purchases, creating a "treasure hunt" shopping experience that attracts customers with high-quality goods at low prices.</p>

          <p>The recent surge in cryptocurrency prices has created approximately 70,000 new millionaires in the past year, bringing the global total to over 240,000. New research indicates these investors spend about 9.7 cents for every dollar of crypto wealth gained, a rate more than double that of stock market or real estate gains, contributing an estimated $145 billion to U.S. consumption in 2024. While some indulge in luxury goods, most spending is directed towards restaurants, entertainment, and real estate, with many holding onto their assets in anticipation of further price increases.</p>

          <p>An Indiana woman, Alison Davis, has been found not guilty of murdering her husband, Kevin Davis, who was found dead at the bottom of their staircase in 2023. Prosecutors had alleged she beat him to death, but no weapon was ever found; the defense maintained it was a tragic accident. A key point of speculation for police was that the couple's protective dog, Willow, was intentionally placed in an upstairs bedroom to prevent investigators from searching it for evidence. However, the jury acquitted Alison Davis after just six hours of deliberation, citing holes in the prosecution's case.</p>

          <p>The NBA is marking its return to China with two preseason games in Macao, a significant step in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The league is aiming to reconnect with its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million social media followers and unlock future growth as U.S. television viewership declines. The return is bolstered by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and reflects years of effort to overcome the political fallout from a 2019 controversy, signaling a renewed focus on the lucrative market.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared that his party is prepared to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party in the next Senedd election. At the party's annual conference, he will promise a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," positioning Plaid Cymru as the primary alternative for voters seeking change. Acknowledging the rise of Reform UK, ap Iorwerth is framing the choice for voters as one between his party's ambitious vision for Wales and the threat posed by Nigel Farage's party.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, is set to alter how high earners make catch-up contributions. Starting in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their additional contributions to a Roth 401(k) on an after-tax basis. This eliminates the option for an upfront tax deduction on these savings for this group, prompting financial advisors to recommend that affected individuals begin tax planning now to decide their best strategy before the new rule takes effect.

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a free speech group affiliated with Columbia University, has won a landmark legal case against the Trump administration. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of pro-Palestinian student activists, including a Columbia student, were unconstitutional and designed to suppress free speech. The victory highlights a stark contrast between the institute's defiant defense of constitutional principles and Columbia University's more conciliatory approach, which recently involved a controversial settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims.</p>
