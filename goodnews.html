The study, led by Wang Shuiyuan at Fudan University, demonstrated the successful use of tellurium nanowire implants in restoring vision in genetically blind mice and a monkey. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, converts visible light and infrared radiation into electrical energy, offering a potential treatment for human blindness. The scientists can use tellurium as a replacement for photoreceptor cells in the retina and send electrical signals converted from light signals to the brain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The research, co-authored by Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study highlights that traditional expectations placing the burden on women clash with rapid economic changes, contributing to the decline in fertility rates.</p>

          <h2>Conflicting Studies on Possible Biosignature on Exoplanet K2-18b</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study suggesting the detection of potential biosignatures on the exoplanet K2-18b is now being challenged by new findings, highlighting the complexities of searching for life beyond Earth. While the initial study identified molecules associated with biological activity, subsequent research suggests that these compounds could also form without the presence of life. Astronomers are re-evaluating the data and models used in the original study, leading to conflicting results and emphasizing the need for more robust evidence. The debate underscores the scientific process and the high burden of proof required to confirm the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>

          <p>European startup founders and venture capitalists are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's grueling '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While some argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, others contend that it leads to burnout, decreased retention, and regulatory challenges. Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to compete effectively. The debate highlights differing values and approaches to work-life balance in the European and Chinese startup ecosystems.</p>

          <h2>AI Scientist Advocates 'Parenting' AI for a Better Future</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI scientist De Kai argues that artificial intelligence should be approached as a 'climate change challenge' rather than a technological arms race, advocating for a new paradigm of 'parenting' AI. In his book, De Kai suggests that since AI learns by absorbing online content, humans need to be conscientious about the role models they present to these systems. By treating AI as children, De Kai believes people will be more inclined to promote ethical and responsible development. This approach aims to address concerns about AI ethics and ensure a positive future with AI.</p>
