          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has voiced his dislike for the new NFL-mandated helmets, comparing the design to a "damn spaceship." The 41-year-old veteran is struggling to find a comfortable replacement for his previous helmet, which is no longer approved under the league's updated safety standards. Rodgers is actively working to find a suitable solution before the upcoming season begins, highlighting the challenges some players face with new equipment regulations. He confirmed that the current season, his 21st in the league, is likely to be his last.</p>

          <p>The UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will incorporate questions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillator use into the driving theory test starting in early 2026. The initiative aims to equip the millions of new drivers who take the test each year with basic life-saving knowledge, as they are often the first to arrive at emergency scenes. Learning materials have already been updated to include this information, emphasizing that immediate CPR and defibrillator use can dramatically increase cardiac arrest survival rates. This change reflects a public health effort to improve emergency response capabilities among the general population.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has declared the water safe to drink for residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong boil water notice. The advisory affected approximately 9,200 households after a faulty valve from 1967 caused a major service disruption. Before resuming normal use, the DWP is urging residents to thoroughly flush their pipes, water heaters, and appliances to clear any stagnant water or sediment. The agency announced it will provide a $20 credit to affected customers for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant rally, with major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs, following a government report on inflation. The data showed that consumer prices in July rose by 2.7% annually, a rate slightly cooler than economists had anticipated. This has increased investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will have the justification to implement an interest rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. Such a move would lower borrowing costs, potentially stimulating further economic activity and providing a boost to investment prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>July Consumer Price Index Shows Annual Inflation at 2.7 Percent</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, a slightly cooler figure than the 2.8% economists had predicted. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.2%, meeting expectations. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, climbed to a five-month high of 3.1% annually. Food prices continued to be a source of stress for consumers, rising 2.9% over the past year. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe the data is not severe enough to prevent a potential interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile and sensitive investigations. The policy change is intended to increase transparency and counter public misinformation, particularly in cases that attract significant social media speculation. This move follows criticism over a lack of consistency in how information was released in several recent high-profile cases. While aiming for greater openness, decisions on releasing such details will remain at the discretion of individual police forces, considering legal and ethical factors.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, has stated that the company's plan to power artificial intelligence data centers with its small modular reactors (SMRs) could make it the most valuable firm in the UK. The engineering giant has secured deals with the UK and Czech governments to provide nuclear energy for the energy-intensive AI sector. Erginbilgic expressed confidence that Rolls-Royce can dominate the emerging global SMR market, which he estimates could be worth over a trillion dollars by 2050. This ambitious strategy has contributed to a tenfold increase in the company's share price since early 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a record-setting day for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain invested in the market despite political and geopolitical uncertainties. He argued that trying to time the market by selling during turbulent periods often results in missing out on significant gains, as issues that cause pessimism are often resolved after stocks have already rallied. Cramer suggested that many of President Trump's controversial actions are not directly related to corporate profitability and that successful companies have adapted to the political environment.

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell in extended trading despite the company reporting second-quarter revenue and full-year guidance that surpassed analyst expectations. The company, which rents out high-demand Nvidia chips, saw its revenue more than triple year-over-year to $1.21 billion, driven by surging demand from clients like OpenAI. However, the company also reported a net loss of $290.5 million and revealed its debt now stands at $11.1 billion. Despite the stock dip, CoreWeave raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling continued confidence in its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>
