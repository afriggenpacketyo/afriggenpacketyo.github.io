          <p>A little-known landmark in Washington, D.C., the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum, commemorates a revolutionary post-Civil War effort. After the war, Clara Barton established an office in this building to locate thousands of missing or deceased Union soldiers, a pioneering initiative that forever changed the military's approach to accounting for its members. The museum preserves the site where Barton and her team worked tirelessly to provide answers and closure to countless families across the nation. Her work laid the groundwork for the American Red Cross, which she would later found.</p>

          <p>In Nederland, Colorado, the Carousel of Happiness stands as a testament to a vision that sustained a Marine during the Vietnam War. While under fire, Corporal Scott Harrison found solace in an image of a carousel in a mountain meadow. Years later, he brought that vision to life by restoring a broken-down carousel, which now operates as a non-profit dedicated to spreading joy. The hand-carved animals and whimsical music offer a place of delight and healing, a mission born from one of the darkest of places, demonstrating the power of hope.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert, drawing from studies of over 200 parent-child relationships, argues that the most vital skill to teach a child is "self-connection." This involves the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice, which fosters resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence. The article suggests that common parental responses, such as dismissing a child's fears or sadness, can inadvertently teach them to distrust their feelings. Instead, parents are encouraged to validate emotions and provide space for their children to develop a strong sense of self.</p>

          <p>Scientific research suggests that personality is not fixed and can be intentionally changed through conscious effort. Writer Olga Khazan, who documented her own journey in the book "Me, But Better," successfully worked to become less neurotic and more extroverted by forcing herself into uncomfortable situations like improv classes. According to University of Kentucky professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala, this approach involves identifying desired traits and consistently adopting behaviors associated with them. While the principles are simple, execution is difficult, but it offers a new way to approach mental health and personal growth.</p>

          <p>A team of archaeologists believes it has identified the wreck of the Nossa Senhora do Cabo, a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier "La Buse" Levasseur in 1721. The ship was carrying a vast treasure of gold, silver, and jewels, estimated to be worth over $100 million today. The wreck was discovered near Nosy Boraha, an island off Madagascar that was a known pirate hideout. While thousands of artifacts have been recovered, the main treasure of La Buse, which he famously alluded to before his execution, remains a 300-year-old mystery.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial "Cop City" training center after a judge ruled it was subject to Georgia's open records law. The lawsuit, brought by a news outlet and a research group, sets a major precedent for the transparency of private police foundations nationwide. The released documents reveal the APF actively lobbied city officials to thwart a public referendum on the project. Activists say this ruling is a crucial step toward preventing such foundations from operating as a "black box" to bypass public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder, are reporting significant improvement in their symptoms after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound. Patients have experienced weight loss, hair regrowth, and the return of regular menstrual cycles. Researchers believe the drugs' effectiveness stems from improving insulin sensitivity, which in turn helps balance hormone levels and reduce testosterone. While more research is needed and insurance coverage remains a major hurdle, these drugs are seen as a potential game-changer for a condition that has lacked effective, comprehensive treatments for decades.</p>

          <p>A series of five powerful earthquakes, the largest registering a magnitude of 7.4, struck in the sea off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula on Sunday.

A tsunami watch was also briefly issued for Hawaii. However, the threat was later downgraded and ultimately cancelled.
