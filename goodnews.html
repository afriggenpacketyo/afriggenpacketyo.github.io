          <p>President Trump has proposed the creation of a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. This system would aim to protect the entire United States from missile attacks. Experts note that building such a system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex than the Iron Dome due to the country's larger size and the different types of missiles it would need to defend against. The idea reflects a desire for enhanced national security but faces substantial technical and logistical challenges.</p>
