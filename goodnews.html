        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card business from Goldman Sachs. The move would solidify JPMorgan's position as the leading U.S. credit card issuer, while allowing Goldman Sachs to exit a challenging consumer finance venture. For Apple, partnering with JPMorgan would bring stability to the credit card program after a period of high growth and regulatory scrutiny under Goldman's management. Other initial contenders for the portfolio, including American Express and Barclays, are no longer in the running. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, with revenue jumping 35% due to the highest number of aircraft deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," citing improved stability in production and performance. The company has increased its 737 Max output to the FAA's limit of 38 per month and aims to generate cash in the fourth quarter. However, challenges remain, including a delay in the certification of its Max 7 and Max 10 models until 2026 and a potential strike at its defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark interest rate steady this week, despite public pressure from President Trump for a rate cut. Economists place the probability of no change at 96%, as the central bank continues to monitor inflation and a solid labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has consistently stated that decisions are data-driven and independent of political influence. While some Fed governors have signaled a desire to cut rates, the consensus appears to favor waiting, possibly until the September meeting, to ensure economic stability and manage inflationary risks from new tariffs.

          <p>American swimmer Katie Ledecky secured another gold medal in her signature event, the 1,500-meter freestyle, at the world championships in Singapore. This victory marks her 22nd world championship gold and adds to her legacy as the most decorated female swimmer in history. Ledecky's winning time was the fifth-fastest ever recorded in the event, and she now holds 25 of the top 26 times in history for the 1,500-meter freestyle.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has upgraded its forecast for global economic growth, now projecting 3.0% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. The revision is partly attributed to a softening of some U.S. tariffs and proactive measures by certain governments to stimulate their economies. The IMF noted a surge in U.S. imports as businesses engaged in "front-loading" to get ahead of anticipated higher taxes. However, the organization cautioned that the potential for new tariffs and increased global uncertainty could still lead to weaker economic activity in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the ancient settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence that its society was organized around women 9,000 years ago. An international team of geneticists analyzed DNA from skeletons buried under homes and found that inhabitants were often related through their mother's side. This suggests a matrilocal system, where men moved in with the woman's family. The findings, which also showed female graves contained significantly more goods than male ones, support long-held archaeological theories about the elevated status of women in one of the world's oldest cities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is now home to over 3,600 wild tigers, accounting for about 75% of the global population, but conservationists warn that significant risks remain. The primary threat is habitat fragmentation caused by deforestation, agriculture, and infrastructure projects, which isolates tiger populations and affects their movement and breeding. In some reserves, this has led to an unhealthy male-to-female ratio, increasing conflict. While modern monitoring techniques have aided conservation, experts stress that protecting the quality of ecosystems, not just the number of animals, is crucial for the long-term survival of the species.</p>

          <p>Xu Gao, chief economist at Bank of China International, has publicly contested the views of Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio regarding the debt situations in China and the U.S. Xu argues that Dalio is mistaken in calling for China to deleverage, asserting that the country's recent economic issues stem from overly harsh deleveraging policies rather than excessive borrowing. He suggests that China needs to correct this mindset to avoid further weighing down its economy. The debate comes as policymakers in Beijing discuss the need for additional stimulus to support growth amid various economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies shifting to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three key strategies for a successful transition. The first involves improving productivity by shortening or eliminating meetings and protecting focused work time. The second is re-engineering work processes to be more efficient, particularly in non-office environments like manufacturing. Finally, successful companies eliminate low-impact work by questioning the value of long-standing tasks and projects. These experiments have shown overwhelmingly positive results, including reduced employee burnout and increased company profits.</p>
