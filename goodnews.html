        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage interest rates dropping to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased properties during recent peak-rate periods may find refinancing to be a beneficial option. The article suggests evaluating several key factors before proceeding, such as whether current rates are low enough to justify the action and the potential risks of waiting for even lower rates. Homeowners should also calculate closing costs, which typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and consider their long-term plans for the property to ensure the financial benefits outweigh the expenses.

This year's agenda includes climate, economic development, and the launch of a new dialogue on AI governance, all set against a backdrop of major global conflicts.

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, financial markets are indicating a high likelihood that the Federal Reserve will cut its key interest rate at its upcoming meeting. While a quarter-point reduction is the most probable scenario, with an 88% chance priced in by traders, a small possibility of a more aggressive half-point cut remains. Economists believe the soft labor market data will build consensus among committee members for easing monetary policy to support the economy. The decision will also be influenced by upcoming inflation data later this week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Technology stocks, including Broadcom and Nvidia, are leading market gains as the 10-year Treasury yield continues to decline following last week's weak jobs report. This market environment is seen as supportive for the tech sector. Separately, BlackRock's recent acquisition of $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup is projected by analysts to add at least 25 cents to its adjusted earnings per share. Another development involves Meta Platforms officially securing a U.S. Army contract to develop augmented reality combat goggles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run, a major half marathon in the UK, have issued a public apology after finisher medals given to 60,000 participants featured the wrong city. The medals were intended to show an aerial view of the race's location, Newcastle and the River Tyne, but instead depicted the rival city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a humorous statement, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, calling it "the most unique T-shirt and medal in Great North Run history."

The group did not collect enough valid signatures to place a repeal referendum on the ballot, according to the city clerk's office. The ordinance, which was approved by the City Council in May, mandates a series of annual wage increases culminating in a $30 minimum wage by July 2028. Labor unions celebrated the outcome as a major victory for working people against corporate interests that had spent millions on the repeal effort.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The court found no errors in the lower court's rulings and deemed the damages awarded by the jury to be "fair and reasonable." The panel of judges also dismissed Trump's argument that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity should invalidate the verdict. This ruling affirms the jury's finding that Trump defamed Carroll by denying her sexual assault allegation.</p>

Despite an impressive record of only four losses in 30 years, the matches against lower-ranked opposition are frequently described as formalities lacking jeopardy or excitement. The analysis notes that while England's possession has increased over the years, shot counts have not, possibly due to opponents deploying deep defensive formations. These games often feel like a contractual obligation before the true test of major tournaments begins.</p>
