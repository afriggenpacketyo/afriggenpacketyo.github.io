          <p>New York City Democrats recently headed to the polls to select their nominee for mayor, in a race seen as a bellwether for the national party's direction. The primary pits former governor Andrew Cuomo, viewed as a moderate, against millennial state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist backed by progressive figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public transit and universal childcare, while Cuomo emphasizes experience and public safety. The outcome of the election could signal the future trajectory of the Democratic Party as it seeks to counter Trump's influence. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that the spin of stars nearing the end of their lives influences the birth of new stars. The study, using data from the Gaia space telescope, found that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The research provides direct evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time. </p>

          <p>A new global study reveals that progress in vaccinating children against life-threatening diseases has stalled in the past two decades, with some countries even experiencing a decline. The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation, leaving millions of children unprotected from diseases like measles, tuberculosis, and polio.

The report highlights the urgent need to address inequalities and ensure that all children benefit from life-saving immunizations. </p>
