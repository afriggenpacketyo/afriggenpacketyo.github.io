          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new all-time high, breaking the $118,000 mark following a record-setting day for institutional investment. Bitcoin ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, which helped fuel the rally. The price surge was also bolstered by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and a potentially larger federal deficit, factors that can serve as positive catalysts for the cryptocurrency, triggering over $650 million in short liquidations.

          <p>Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs is testing "Devin," an autonomous AI software engineer from the startup Cognition, marking a major milestone in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank's technology chief, Marco Argenti, announced that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling routine tasks like updating internal code. This move represents a shift toward "agentic AI," capable of executing complex, multi-step jobs, which could significantly boost productivity while also raising concerns about future job displacement.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential interest earnings from a $10,000 deposit into either a short-term or long-term certificate of deposit (CD) in the current economic environment. Although short-term CDs presently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, the extended time frame of long-term CDs results in significantly greater overall returns. For instance, a five-year CD could generate over $2,200 in interest, while a one-year CD would yield around $440, illustrating the key trade-off between rate and term length for savers.

Researchers from the University of Oxford estimate the comet's age at over 7 billion years, which would make it approximately 3 billion years older than our own 4.5-billion-year-old solar system. As only the third known interstellar visitor, the comet offers a rare and valuable opportunity to study an object originating from a distant part of our galaxy.</p>

Although infertility stems from male factors in about half of cases among heterosexual couples, men are frequently not evaluated, and treatments for them are less likely to be covered by insurance. The article proposes that expanding access to male-specific infertility care could be a politically viable way to increase birth rates without focusing solely on more invasive treatments for women.</p>

McIlroy observed that the American team appears more "player-led," which contrasts with the European team's structure that relies on a single, empowered figurehead like captain Luke Donald. While praising Bradley's performance, he suggested that the American approach of giving players more ownership could be a strategic disadvantage, as seen in their previous loss in Rome.</p>
