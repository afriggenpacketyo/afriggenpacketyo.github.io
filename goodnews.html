          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people following the discovery of World War II-era bombs. The evacuation affected a large portion of the city center, including hotels, bridges, the town hall, and transportation hubs.

The operation is considered one of the largest evacuations in the city's postwar history, as authorities worked to safely defuse the unexploded ordnances.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is being remembered 150 years after his birth as a voice for democracy and a conscience of a nation during Nazi rule. Mann gained global recognition for works like "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," and he used his platform to critique the German "catastrophe" that led to the Holocaust. After escaping Germany in the 1930s, Mann emigrated to the US and delivered radio speeches to his compatriots, urging resistance against fascism. His literature and unwavering stance against authoritarianism have solidified his lasting legacy as a courageous and influential figure.</p>

          <p>Tesla experienced a rebound in Australian sales in May, reaching its highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y. Despite global headwinds and declining sales in the U.S. and Europe, Tesla's Australian sales jumped to 3,897 vehicles, primarily due to a 122.5% year-over-year increase in Model Y sales. However, year-to-date sales in Australia remain down 48.2% compared to the same period last year, and the company faces increased competition and reputational challenges linked to CEO Elon Musk. Tesla has also seen some success in other markets, including a significant increase in sales in Norway and record sales in Turkey.</p>
