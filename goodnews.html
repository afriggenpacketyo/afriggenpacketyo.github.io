          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after being politically sidelined for years. However, the KMT faces a recall campaign led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that could threaten its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failing to address the recall challenge could disrupt the leadership transition and further fracture the party. Chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down, suggesting Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor, with the party chair race expected to be announced in July. The KMT hopes for a smooth transition to a new leader by October. Optimism is tempered by the political challenges facing the party. </p>

          <p>The UK government plans to spend ¬£1.5 billion on six new munitions and explosives factories as part of its strategic defence review, aiming to enhance war readiness. This investment will support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. The move comes in response to lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, which highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production capabilities. The government aims to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be quickly scaled up, with UK munitions spending expected to reach ¬£6 billion during this parliament. The opposition has welcomed the investment but calls for greater ambition in rearmament.</p>

Shops and supermarkets are now prohibited from stocking disposable vapes, although rechargeable and refillable devices can still be sold. Disposable vapes have been identified as a major factor in the rise of youth vaping, with millions of vapes discarded annually. Retailers violating the ban face fines, and health experts emphasize the need for further regulation to address youth vaping. Vape use has increased significantly in the last decade, with a substantial proportion of vapers using disposable versions.</p>

The controversy stemmed from a New Yorker interview where LuPone criticized Lewis and Audra McDonald. In her apology, LuPone expressed regret for her emotional responses and committed to making amends, including personally apologizing to Lewis and McDonald. McDonald stated that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years and was unaware of any rift between them.</p>
