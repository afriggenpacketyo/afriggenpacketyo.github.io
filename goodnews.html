          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 22:19:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a significant boom in the sales of electric-powered heavy trucks, which are rapidly gaining market share due to government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure. This surge is having a direct impact on the country's consumption of diesel fuel, contributing to a decline in demand for oil. The trend has prompted some analysts to revise their forecasts, suggesting that China's peak oil demand may occur sooner than previously expected. This shift mirrors the country's earlier adoption of electric cars and LNG-powered trucks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a push to enhance its resource security, China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year. These discoveries include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, elements crucial for various high-tech industries. The announcement coincides with a reported 23.9% year-on-year increase in investment in non-hydrocarbon mineral exploration. This strategic effort aims to strengthen China's domestic supply of critical minerals essential for sectors like aerospace, semiconductors, and green energy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a tentative ruling that signals she may order the Trump administration to cease indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance. The ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by immigrant rights groups alleging that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people in Los Angeles without probable cause. During the hearing, the judge pressed the government's attorney for specific evidence to refute these claims, noting a lack of documentation for the arrests, which plaintiffs argue has terrorized local communities.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped underground following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's multi-million dollar Clearwater Project. A large-scale response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including its Urban Search and Rescue teams, was mobilized for the operation. Fortunately, none of the rescued workers sustained any visible injuries, and Cal/OSHA has launched an investigation into the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling allows a class-action lawsuit, filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant parents and their infants, to proceed. This decision was made in accordance with new standards recently set by the Supreme Court regarding the use of universal injunctions. The White House criticized the ruling, calling it an unlawful attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court and impede the president's policies.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is set to auction NWA 16788, the largest known piece of the planet Mars ever found on Earth. The 54-pound meteorite, which traveled 140 million miles through space before landing in the Sahara Desert, is expected to sell for as much as $4 million. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making up less than 1% of all meteorites found on our planet. This particular specimen represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on Earth, offering a significant opportunity for scientific study and collection.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable coincidence, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science has discovered a dinosaur fossil located directly beneath its own parking lot. The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra, believed to be from a plant-eating dinosaur from 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep. The drilling was part of a study to explore the potential for geothermal heating for the museum. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon.</p>

President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance on social media, linking its rise to his administration's tariff policies, which he claims are bringing in hundreds of billions of dollars.

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning once more, marking their return to operation 14 months after being knocked down by high winds. The April 2024 accident, caused by a mechanical failure, left the iconic landmark without its signature feature. The restoration was celebrated with a street performance by the cabaret's can-can dancers and fireworks. The return of the turning sails restores a key symbol of Parisian nightlife, which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors to the Montmartre district annually.</p>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for creating effective political slogans based on an analysis of 20,000 campaign messages. The research pinpoints eight words—such as 'people,' 'change,' 'strong,' and 'together'—that consistently resonate with voters across different cultures and political affiliations. The article explores this concept, discussing how these words act as emotional shortcuts. It also examines famous bespoke slogans like "Get Brexit Done" and "Make America Great Again" as powerful, context-specific exceptions to the formula.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially applied for permits to test and operate its Robotaxi autonomous vehicle service in the Phoenix metropolitan area. This move follows the company's initial pilot program in Austin, Texas, and signals an effort to compete directly with Waymo, which has operated a driverless service in Phoenix since 2020. Tesla's expansion comes as its current automated driving systems face regulatory scrutiny following several documented incidents in Austin. The company plans to use its camera-based system, which it claims will make its service more economically viable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite South Korea having the world's lowest birth rate, its fertility clinics are experiencing a significant boom in demand. This paradoxical trend is driven by a growing number of individuals and couples turning to treatments like IVF, reflecting a cultural shift toward more proactive family planning. While many young South Koreans delay having children due to high costs and societal pressures, the demand for fertility services indicates a persistent desire for parenthood. The government has expanded subsidies for treatments, hoping to support this trend and address the country's demographic crisis.</p>
