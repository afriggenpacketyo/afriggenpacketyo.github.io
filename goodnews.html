          <h2>SK Hynix Reports Record-Breaking Second-Quarter Profit and Revenue Driven by AI Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:21:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor giant SK Hynix has reported its most profitable quarter ever, with both second-quarter revenue and operating profit reaching new record highs that surpassed market expectations. This exceptional performance is primarily fueled by the surging global demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM), a crucial technology used in advanced AI chipsets for clients like the U.S. firm Nvidia. In its forward-looking statement, the company expressed strong optimism, noting that stable customer inventory levels and expected demand from upcoming product launches make sharp corrections in demand unlikely for the rest of the year. This solidifies its position as a dominant force in the AI hardware supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its Search, YouTube, and Cloud divisions. However, the company also announced a significant increase in its capital expenditure forecast for 2025, raising it by $10 billion to a total of $85 billion to meet the growing demand for its AI and Cloud services. CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted the growth of AI products like AI Overviews and the Gemini app, and noted a new partnership with OpenAI, which will utilize Google's cloud infrastructure. The increased spending reflects the intense investment race in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>South Korea's Economy Expands in Second Quarter, Avoiding Technical Recession</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 19:15:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea successfully avoided a technical recession as its economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, outperforming economists' forecasts and reversing the previous quarter's contraction. The growth was largely propelled by a strong 4.2% rebound in exports, particularly in semiconductors and chemical products. This positive economic data comes as South Korea faces a critical trade deadline with the U.S., with potential 25% tariffs looming if a new deal is not reached. The Bank of Korea has been holding interest rates steady, balancing low growth forecasts with a focus on financial stability as inflation remains near its target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darts world champion Luke Littler staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Jermaine Wattimena 13-11 and advance to the World Matchplay quarter-finals in a tense match. After falling behind 7-2, an invigorated Littler won six consecutive legs to turn the tide, eventually securing the victory in a tie-break. In a major upset, three-time champion Michael van Gerwen was eliminated by Josh Rock, who fought back from a 9-6 deficit to win. Other notable results include Gerwyn Price's dominant 11-3 victory over Chris Dobey and Andrew Gilding's win, which sets up a quarter-final clash with Littler.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a comprehensive "AI Action Plan" designed to accelerate artificial intelligence development and maintain U.S. leadership over global competitors like China. The plan includes over 90 policy actions, such as expediting the construction of data centers, promoting AI exports to allies, and removing what the administration calls "burdensome" regulations. A key component involves new rules for government contractors to eliminate perceived ideological bias in AI chatbots. During the announcement, President Trump emphasized the need for U.S. tech companies to be "all-in for America" in what he framed as a critical technological race.</p>

          <h2>New Analysis Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Significantly Reduces Risk of Death and Chronic Disease</h2>

          <p>A new large-scale analysis published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that taking 7,000 steps per day is associated with major health benefits, challenging the more commonly cited 10,000-step goal. Researchers found that achieving this target was linked to a 47% lower risk of death and significant reductions in the risk of dementia, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes compared to taking only 2,000 steps. The study emphasizes that while 10,000 steps remains a good target for active individuals, 7,000 steps may be a more realistic and achievable goal for the general public to gain clinically meaningful health improvements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>IBM's shares dropped in after-hours trading despite the company reporting second-quarter results that beat overall revenue and earnings projections. The negative market reaction was primarily due to the company's software revenue, which, while growing 10%, fell short of analysts' consensus estimates. CEO Arvind Krishna noted that some clients reprioritized spending toward hardware and that geopolitical tensions led a few clients to act more cautiously. On a positive note, IBM's consulting and infrastructure segments both exceeded revenue expectations, and the company's generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion.

          <p>In-N-Out Burger is not moving its headquarters out of California, despite a recent controversy sparked by owner Lynsi Snyder's comments about relocating her family to Tennessee. Snyder's statement that doing business in California is "not easy" led to a wave of misinformation suggesting the entire company was leaving the state that made it an icon. In reality, the company is expanding eastward with a second headquarters in Tennessee while consolidating its Southern California corporate operations in Baldwin Park. Snyder clarified on Instagram that where she raises her family is separate from her appreciation for the company's California customers.</p>

          <h2>The Word 'OK' Traces its Origins to a 19th-Century Joke and a Presidential Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ubiquitous word "OK" is a uniquely American invention that originated as a joke in the 1830s. Scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839 as a playful, misspelled abbreviation of "all correct" written as "oll korrect." The term gained widespread popularity during the 1840 presidential campaign of Martin Van Buren, whose nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently matched the initials. His supporters formed "O.K. Clubs," cementing the term in the American lexicon. Its simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, becoming one of the most recognized words on the planet.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:26:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on the sale of primary residences to stimulate the housing market. Currently, home sellers can exclude profits up to $250,000 for single filers and $500,000 for joint filers, with gains above these thresholds subject to tax. The proposal aligns with a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which argues the change would unlock equity for long-term homeowners, especially seniors in high-value areas. Tax policy experts suggest that while the idea may gain some interest, a more likely outcome would be raising the existing exemption thresholds rather than a full elimination.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are urging the public to avoid prolonged periods of inactivity as a key measure to help prevent dangerous blood clots. According to medical experts cited in this article, regular movement and exercise are crucial for maintaining healthy blood flow and circulation, which reduces the risk of blood pooling and forming clots, particularly in the legs. In addition to staying active, doctors recommend staying well-hydrated, understanding personal risk factors such as obesity and smoking, and consulting a physician about any concerns. Symptoms like sudden swelling, pain, or skin color changes in a limb warrant immediate medical attention.</p>
