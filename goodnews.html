        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's major spending bill is receiving mixed reactions from the financial sector, with some institutions like the American Bankers Association supporting it as a necessary economic stimulus. Proponents argue that by extending expiring tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bill prevents a significant fiscal contraction and could boost investment. However, critics, including some analysts and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, raise serious concerns about its fiscal irresponsibility, projecting it will add over $3 trillion to the federal deficit. The debate highlights a deep divide on the long-term economic consequences of the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

Beyond the pitch, Itoje leads a "portfolio existence," running an art gallery focused on African art, engaging in philanthropy, and maintaining a keen interest in politics.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is grappling with the complex question of how much money people truly need to save for an adequate retirement, a key focus of its upcoming Pension Review. Setting benchmarks is challenging, as goals that are too high can discourage lower earners, while goals that are too low may give higher earners a false sense of security. Analysis from Hargreaves Lansdown reviewed different measures, including fixed income levels and relative "replacement rates" based on pre-retirement earnings. The article concludes that relative measures may be more effective, as they better reflect an individual's established lifestyle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian questions why French cinema has been slow to depict the country's significant role in the transatlantic slave trade, in contrast to Hollywood's numerous films on the subject. The article notes that for many in France, American productions like "12 Years a Slave" are the main cinematic reference for slavery. It highlights recent, though marginalized, French films like "No Chains No Masters" and "Fanon" that are finally telling these stories from a French colonial perspective. The author argues that while audiences are ready for these narratives, the French film industry still pushes them to the margins.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the U.S. dollar since last November, and analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast the trend will continue into 2025.

The People's Bank of China has been setting stronger daily reference rates, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

Panelists argued that many prominent AI models are English-centric, failing to capture the nuances of other languages and cultures. They identified open-source models and democratized access to cloud computing as key tools for nations, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, to build their own AI ecosystems. This approach would foster local talent and create a collective energy to compete globally, rather than relying on a few dominant, closed-source systems.</p>

          <p>A private survey of Chinese manufacturing showed a surprising return to growth in June, contrasting with official data that indicated a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI registered 50.4, beating expectations and suggesting improving conditions among the smaller, export-oriented firms it primarily covers. The expansion was supported by the fastest production growth since November, though new export orders continued to decline. Despite the upbeat headline number, the report noted that fierce price competition and cautious hiring plans continue to weigh on business optimism and profit margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two major bills aimed at accelerating housing construction by reforming the state's stringent environmental review process. The legislation exempts most urban housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often blamed for delaying development. Newsom forced one of the bills through the legislature by tying it to the state budget, overcoming opposition from some progressive lawmakers and labor unions. Experts believe these changes could be the most significant reforms to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax on large technology firms after facing significant pressure from the Trump administration. The White House had labeled the tax a "blatant attack" on U.S. companies and had threatened retaliatory tariffs, causing a temporary halt in trade negotiations. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney confirmed the tax was dropped as part of a broader negotiation, allowing trade talks to resume. The 3% tax would have affected giants like Amazon, Google, and Meta, and its withdrawal marks a significant concession by Canada in the ongoing trade disputes.</p>

          <p>The commander of U.S. Northern Command has reportedly requested that some of the California National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles be reassigned to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The proposal would shift 200 of the roughly 4,000 troops who were federalized by President Trump to respond to protests against immigration enforcement. The initial deployment was highly controversial and legally challenged by California's governor, who warned it could interfere with the state's ability to fight fires.
