          <p>A U.S. federal judge has reversed the Trump administration's decision to freeze approximately $2 billion in research funding for Harvard University, ruling that the action violated the institution's First Amendment rights. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that the government's justification for the freeze, which included accusations of antisemitism and "radical left" ideologies, was likely a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." While acknowledging that Harvard should have done more to combat antisemitism on campus, the judge concluded the administration's true aim was not to fight discrimination. The ruling vacates the freeze orders and bars the government from withholding further payments on existing grants.</p>

          <p>Five years after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Los Angeles Unified School District has settled a lawsuit filed by parents who alleged it failed to provide adequate education during campus closures. The settlement will provide tutoring and other academic support to an estimated 100,000 of the district's most vulnerable students over the next three school years. The lawsuit originally sought to compel more live instruction and better technology for students, particularly Black and Latino children who were disproportionately affected by learning setbacks. While the resolution comes too late for students who were in high school during the pandemic, it mandates regular assessments and teacher training to address ongoing academic gaps.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is considering the creation of its own development bank, a move that could establish financial instruments less susceptible to U.S. sanctions and influence. This initiative is highlighted by China's pledge of US$1.4 billion in loans to SCO member states, signaling a push for greater economic independence within the bloc. For new member Iran, this development is particularly crucial as it faces the potential restoration of UN sanctions that would sever its access to international finance. Tehran views integration into SCO financial frameworks as a strategic necessity for economic survival and a symbol of its continued alliances in the East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant antitrust ruling, a federal judge has decided against forcing Google to sell its Chrome web browser, a decision that caused parent company Alphabet's stock to surge 9%. While Judge Amit Mehta found Google to be a monopolist in online search, he deemed a forced divestiture of Chrome "incredibly messy and highly risky." Instead, the judge imposed other remedies, such as requiring Google to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to help foster competition. The Department of Justice supported the remedies as a step forward, though some advocacy groups expressed disappointment that the measures did not go far enough. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Long Island judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing, specifically whole genome sequencing, can be used as evidence in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This landmark decision marks the first time such evidence has been deemed admissible in a New York court, setting a new statewide precedent. Prosecutors used the cutting-edge technique to link hairs found on victims' remains to Heuermann and his family members. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab that performed the testing is not licensed in New York, with a decision on that challenge expected later this month.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill aimed at banning members of Congress and their immediate families from trading or owning individual stocks is gaining significant momentum in the House. The Restore Trust in Congress Act consolidates several previous proposals and would require lawmakers to sell their individual stock holdings shortly after taking office. The bill is backed by a wide range of representatives from across the political spectrum, who argue that the current rules create public distrust and the appearance of conflicts of interest. Supporters are threatening to force a floor vote on the measure if leadership does not bring it up for consideration by the end of the month.</p>
