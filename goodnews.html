          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 17:35:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The levy remains at 25% for the UK, contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (EPD) from May 8. However, the order stipulates that the UK levy could rise to 50% if it fails to comply with the terms of the EPD by July 9. A UK government spokesperson affirmed the commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors, including steel, as part of their plan for change. This decision highlights the complex trade relationships and negotiations between the US and its allies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Middle and major powers in the Asia-Pacific region are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, using trade, investment, and technology as tools of influence. This strategy involves balancing and maneuvering between two other powers to build leverage and reduce dependency. While triangular diplomacy offers agility and tactical scope, it also carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability. The approach is prominent in a world where post-war institutions are declining and multilateral commitments are being reassessed. The article highlights the complexities of navigating international relations in an era of shifting power dynamics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has lifted the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a punishment for past misdeeds. The removal of the growth restriction reflects the bank's progress in addressing its deficiencies and fulfilling the conditions required for its termination. The asset cap had prevented Wells Fargo from growing key lines of its business for years, but now it can increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. Wells Fargo shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The New York City Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice runs "Flip the Script," a 40-week program that trains at-risk teens and young adults in filmmaking to combat gun violence. Participants, often with gun charges, are paid $20 an hour and mentored by entertainment industry professionals. The program aims to provide these youth with a new path and skills to launch careers in the entertainment industry. Participants are expected to finish a short film about gun violence this summer, with the goal of premiering it at a movie theater and entering it into the Tribeca Film Festival. Since its inception in 2021, over 60 people have graduated from the program, with 70% still employed.</p>

Former regime firefighters and members of the White Helmets, a volunteer rescue organization, are now learning to work side-by-side in a Damascus firehouse. This collaboration represents a small but significant step towards reconciliation in a city deeply divided by years of conflict. The firehouse serves as a microcosm of Syria's divisions and a symbol of hope for the future. It remains to be seen if this can be a model for other sectors of society.</p>

The girl and her parents, who are from Mexico, originally received temporary permission to enter the U.S. legally through Tijuana in 2023. The Trump administration had rescinded the legal protections of the girl and her parents, leaving them vulnerable to deportation. Her doctor said she could die within days of losing her medical care for short bowel syndrome.

Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said the company has worked to reduce its exposure to China and limit price hikes for shoppers. Tariffs have also increased U.S. consumers' desire to find deep discounts, with more middle- and higher-income customers shopping its stores more frequently. (not investment advice)</p>

The Rutherford County Sheriff's Office is in contact with the zebra's owner, who obtained the animal on Friday night, and anyone who sees the zebra is asked to contact them.</p>
