          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new missile defense system called the "Golden Dome," aimed at protecting the U.S. from missile threats. The project, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" program, could cost tens to hundreds of billions of dollars. The system will integrate with existing defense capabilities and should be fully operational before the end of Trump's term, capable of intercepting missiles from any location, including space. The announcement follows Trump's calls for a U.S. missile defense shield similar to Israel's Iron Dome, despite existing missile defense systems already in use.</p>

The decision reflects skepticism from health officials about vaccines, and the FDA is slated to outline its approach to COVID vaccination, which could lead to major changes in regulatory approval. The approval requires Novavax to conduct studies on the vaccine's association with heart conditions.

          <p>A California appeals court has ruled that the Temecula school district must immediately set aside its ban on critical race theory (CRT) while litigation proceeds. The court found that the school board's resolution was "unconstitutionally vague" and lacked sufficient standards, causing confusion and anxiety among teachers. The resolution defined CRT as a divisive ideology that assigns moral fault based on race, which the court deemed a subjective perception. The ruling reverses a trial court's decision, with the appeals court arguing the policy fails to provide fair notice and leads to arbitrary enforcement.</p>
