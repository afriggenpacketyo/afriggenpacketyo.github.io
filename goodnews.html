          <p>Tesla has appointed Jack Hartung, a long-time Chipotle executive, to its board of directors, effective June 1st, as the company grapples with declining EV sales and profits. Hartung, known for his disciplined financial approach at Chipotle during the COVID-19 pandemic, will also join Tesla's audit committee, expanding the board to nine members. This appointment comes at a time when concerns are rising about CEO Elon Musk's focus, particularly with his role in President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Hartung's son-in-law is a service technician for Tesla, and he also serves on the boards of Portillo's, The Honest Company, and ZocDoc.</p>

          <p>After several high-profile Republicans declined to run for key U.S. Senate races in 2026, some within the party are debating whether they face challenges in recruiting competitive candidates. Key Senate races in Georgia and New Hampshire are drawing particular attention after potential contenders opted out, leading to concerns about the party's ability to attract centrist candidates. While some Republicans see these decisions as signs of broader issues related to Trump's influence, others argue they are isolated incidents and remain confident in their ability to field strong candidates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report indicates that rice brands sold across the United States contain high levels of toxic heavy metals like arsenic, prompting concerns about potential health risks. Experts recommend diversifying diets to include rice alternatives like quinoa, barley, and couscous, which contain lower levels of heavy metals. Consumers are also advised to check labels for the rice's growing region, as rice grown in California has been found to have lower arsenic levels than rice grown in the Southeast U.S. Cooking rice like pasta, using more water and draining the excess, can also reduce arsenic content by 40% to 60%.</p>
