          <p>A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plans to cut jobs and reorganize major federal agencies. The judge stated that agencies cannot disregard Congress's mandates and that the President cannot initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without Congressional partnership. The Trump administration has requested an emergency pause from the Supreme Court, arguing that the order impedes the Executive Branch's ability to reduce the federal workforce. The judge's injunction relates to an executive order signed by President Trump on February 11, which aimed to transform the Federal bureaucracy through large-scale reductions in force.</p>

          <h2>Clownfish Shrink in Response to Extreme Ocean Heat Wave, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 10:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a severe heat wave in 2023, scientists discovered that clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea shrank in size. The researchers measured 134 clownfish monthly and found that most of them got shorter by a few millimeters, suggesting it's an adaptation to help them survive hotter ocean temperatures. The study, published in Science Advances, indicates that being small has advantages in a hot climate, potentially helping clownfish meet their energy requirements. The fish that shrank had a much higher chance of survival, adding complexity to the understanding of how marine life adapts to climate change.</p>

Stroll's car sustained rear suspension damage, and he took no further part in the session. Leclerc was also given a one-place grid penalty for Sunday's race.</p>

          <p>Three independent analyses have challenged a recent claim by astronomers that they might have found signs of life on the exoplanet K2-18b. The initial data suggested the presence of dimethyl sulfide, a molecule produced by life on Earth, but the new analyses found no compelling evidence for it. The critics argue that the new mid-infrared observations were much weaker than those in near-infrared, which could fool researchers with faint noise masquerading as a real signal of dimethyl sulfide. However, other researchers plan to present new observations of the planet that could dispel much of the confusion.</p>

Short-term CDs (around six months to one year) have higher interest rates than longer terms right now. A practical approach could be to ladder your CDs, buying some one year, some two years, some three years, etc. (not investment advice)</p>

Mortgage rates are closer to 6-7%. Taylor Jessee, CFP, founder of Impact Financial, says, "If the Fed stops raising rates then I'd anticipate mortgage rates to also stop going up. That's good news for borrowers." The best rates go to borrowers with credit scores in the mid- to high-700s or above.</p>
