          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to shift healthcare from reaction to prevention, investing ¬£650 million in DNA research by 2030. The program aims to use genomics and AI to revolutionize disease prevention, enabling earlier diagnoses and personalized healthcare. Blood samples from umbilical cords will be used to sequence complete DNA, screening for approximately 7,000 single gene disorders, building on a previous study tracking the genetic code of up to 100,000 newborns. The goal is to reduce pressure on NHS services and improve public health outcomes.</p>

          <p>Chinese brands are experiencing increased success in Europe, bolstered by strategic advertising and sports sponsorships. Xiaomi, for instance, is planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, focusing on developed markets, with a long-term goal of 10,000 overseas stores. This expansion follows an adjustment in Xiaomi's retail strategy, aiming to align with the purchasing behavior of European consumers. The brand's enhanced image and quality perception, combined with effective marketing strategies, are contributing to its growing presence and acceptance in the European market. This shift reflects a broader trend of Chinese brands gaining competitiveness and consumer trust in Europe.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament has passed a bill legalizing assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social shift comparable to the Abortion Act of 1967. The bill now moves to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face considerable debate and potential amendments. While opinion polls indicate strong public support for the change, some members of Parliament expressed reservations about the specific bill, leading to a narrow majority in the vote. The government anticipates a lengthy "commencement period" to prepare for implementation, with initial estimates suggesting hundreds seeking assisted deaths annually, potentially rising to 4,000 after a decade.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an intensifying heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach up to 34C, prompting the Met Office to issue a yellow thunderstorm warning for parts of northern England, the Midlands, and Wales. The warning is in effect from Saturday afternoon into Sunday, with potential for localized flash flooding, large hail, and lightning. An amber heat-health alert issued by the UK Health Security Agency is also in force until Monday, warning of likely pressures on health and social care services and a potential rise in deaths, particularly among vulnerable populations. Despite the heat, cooler air is expected to bring some relief on Sunday, with temperatures gradually decreasing into Monday, though another rise is anticipated later in the week.</p>

Guben, for example, has seen some success with its program, converting temporary residents into long-term settlers. These initiatives aim to counteract the demographic challenges of declining birth rates and emigration, while also addressing the need for skilled workers and a welcoming culture to attract migrants from both within and outside the EU.</p>

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has approved legislation that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The bill now heads to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who has expressed his support for such bans. The legislation only applies to the sale and manufacturing of assault weapons, not possession, and aims to align Rhode Island with neighboring states. Critics argue that the ban will do little to curb mass shootings and will only punish law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates describe the proposed ban as the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>

          <p>Due to surging rice prices, Japanese restaurants and food companies are increasingly turning to noodles as a cost-effective alternative. Antworks Co., operator of pork rice bowl eateries, has opened its first ramen noodle restaurant and plans to expand its noodle business. Yoshinoya Holdings Co. is also strengthening its ramen noodle offerings, citing the saturated beef bowl market and the ability to balance ingredient costs. With rice prices doubling from the previous year, consumers are seeking alternatives, leading to increased sales of frozen udon noodles and other Western-style breakfast foods.</p>
