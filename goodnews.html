          <p>The UK is more likely to experience a hotter-than-normal summer with an increased chance of heatwaves, according to the Met Office's latest three-month outlook. The prediction indicates that meteorological summer, from June 1 to August 31, has twice the likelihood of being hotter than normal in 2025. This follows an unprecedented spring that was the sunniest, as well as one of the driest and warmest, on record.</p>
