          <h2>FDA Approves Three Natural Food Colors Amid Concerns Over Artificial Dyes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 13:52:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA has approved three natural food colors: Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate, in response to growing health concerns about artificial food dyes. This decision follows calls from officials to phase out petroleum-based dyes, though the FDA stopped short of an outright ban, instead accelerating the review of natural alternatives. The approved additives can be used in a variety of foods and beverages, including juices, smoothies, cereals, candies, and frostings, offering manufacturers safer options for achieving desired colors. The approval is viewed as a positive step toward healthier food choices for consumers. Optimism score is 75.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump publicly considered raising taxes on wealthy Americans, while simultaneously suggesting Republicans should oppose such a measure. This deliberation followed Trump's outreach to House Speaker Mike Johnson about including a tax hike on the highest earners in the GOP's tax and spending bill. Trump stated he would "graciously" accept a tax increase for the rich to benefit lower and middle-income workers, but also expressed concern about potential political backlash, referencing George H.W. Bush's broken promise. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that Trump personally wouldn't mind paying more, but negotiations are ongoing, leaving the policy unclear.</p>

          <p>Researchers have likely located the wreckage of the Dutch ship Koning William de Tweede, which sank off the coast of Australia in June 1857, resulting in the deaths of 16 crew members. The discovery was made after four years of searching, hindered by poor underwater visibility. Parts of the ship, including its winch and iron components, were found on the seabed of Guichen Bay. Future monitoring will be conducted at the site to further uncover the ship's maritime history. The waters off Australia's coast are known for numerous shipwrecks, with several others recently discovered.</p>

          <p>Epic Games has submitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge ruled in favor of Epic in a contempt ruling, potentially paving the way for the game's return to iPhones. Fortnite was removed from the App Store in 2020 after Epic Games bypassed Apple's commission fees by linking to its own website. The recent court ruling prohibits Apple from charging commissions on link-outs. While Apple could still reject the submission, this move marks the latest development in the ongoing legal battle between the two companies, which has already shifted the economics of app development for iPhones.</p>
