        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AppLovin's stock experienced a significant jump after the company announced better-than-expected earnings and revenue, coupled with the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash. This deal will also grant AppLovin a 20% ownership stake in Tripledot. While the first-quarter net income rose sharply to $576 million, the company anticipates lower sales for the second quarter, falling short of analyst predictions. Despite the projected sales dip, investors reacted positively to the earnings beat and strategic business shift.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to nominate Dr. Casey Means as the new Surgeon General, replacing his initial choice, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Dr. Means, a wellness influencer and co-author of "Good Energy," advocates for addressing metabolic dysfunction as a root cause of chronic diseases. She is expected to collaborate closely with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on wellness initiatives. This decision follows concerns raised about Dr. Nesheiwat's qualifications and ideological alignment with the president, marking a shift towards a nominee with strong ties to the Make America Healthy Again movement, or MAHA.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock value increased following the Trump administration's announcement of its intention to reverse the "AI diffusion rule," a move that would lift restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence chips. The Commerce Department stated that the current rule is overly complex and stifles American innovation, planning to replace it with a simpler rule. AMD CEO Lisa Su emphasized the need for a balance between national security and promoting the American chip industry, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously expressed concerns about being excluded from the Chinese AI market.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded the race to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his challenges to the election results. Griffin stated that he respects the court's decision and will not appeal, ending his six-month effort to overturn the election. The ruling is a significant victory for Democrats in the swing state, securing Riggs an eight-year term on the Republican-majority court and improving Democrats' prospects of regaining the court's majority in 2028.</p>
