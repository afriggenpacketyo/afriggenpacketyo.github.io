          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 10:23:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the August 12 tariff deadline with China will likely be extended following upcoming negotiations in Stockholm. The talks aim to build on a recent truce that lowered punitive tariffs from both nations, fostering a more constructive relationship. Bessent hopes to address broader economic issues, such as China's manufacturing surplus and its purchase of sanctioned oil from Russia and Iran. The goal is to move beyond trade disputes toward more comprehensive economic cooperation between the two global powers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A licensed psychotherapist and author argues that the common advice to "just be yourself" is flawed and can be counterproductive. The article explains that humans have multiple "selves" that vary depending on context and emotional state, and using authenticity as an excuse for poor behavior can damage relationships. Instead of raw self-expression, the author advocates for "self-leadership," which involves mindfully choosing which part of yourself to present in a given situation. This approach emphasizes self-awareness and responsibility, allowing for more aligned and less reactive behavior in both personal and professional life.</p>

          <p>OpenAI and Oracle are significantly expanding their Stargate AI infrastructure project, committing to develop an additional 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity in the United States. This expansion is part of a four-year, $500 billion joint venture with Softbank, aimed at bolstering U.S. AI capabilities. OpenAI reported that parts of the first facility, Stargate I in Texas, are already operational and have created thousands of jobs. The announcement counters recent reports of project delays and reaffirms the companies' commitment to what they describe as one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Businesses are maintaining their spending on corporate travel but are becoming more strategic due to ongoing trade uncertainties, according to new industry reports. While overall spending increased 15% year-over-year, growth forecasts have been moderated due to economic pressures and policy unpredictability. Companies are prioritizing essential relationship-building travel, such as individual client meetings, over large group events. Airlines report that corporate demand has stabilized as businesses adapt to the new economic landscape, though it remains "choppy" and has not reached the growth levels initially expected at the start of the year.

          <h2>Experts Suggest Current High Rates Present a Favorable, But Not Universal, Opportunity for Annuities</h2>

          <p>Financial experts note that current annuity rates are highly competitive, driven by elevated Treasury yields and strong market competition. With some providers offering rates significantly higher than in recent years, now could be an opportune time for retirees to lock in guaranteed income. However, they caution that annuities are not suitable for everyone, particularly those who may need liquid assets for unforeseen expenses or have declining health. The decision should be based on an individual's comprehensive financial plan and risk tolerance, rather than solely trying to time the market for the best possible rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he believes the Federal Reserve needs an operational review, he does not think its chair, Jerome Powell, should resign. This stance contrasts with President Trump's calls for Powell to quit. Bessent suggested the review should be conducted internally by Powell himself, focusing on the Fed's non-monetary policy functions, which he claims have grown without sufficient oversight. He framed it as an opportunity for Powell to right-size the central bank's operations while keeping interest rate decisions independent from political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's export growth accelerated in June, partly due to a temporary rush of orders from U.S. companies ahead of a potential return to higher tariffs in August. While exports to the United States fell by 16%, this was a significant improvement from the 34.5% drop in May, indicating a short-term reprieve. Despite the ongoing trade war, China's overall global trade reached a record high in the first half of the year, driven by diversification to markets in Southeast Asia and Europe. However, analysts predict that sustained high tariffs will likely slow export growth in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett has refuted reports that Berkshire Hathaway's railroad, BNSF, was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a rival railroad. The 94-year-old investor told CNBC that neither he nor his successor, Greg Abel, had spoken with the investment bank about any such deal. Buffett reiterated his long-held aversion to using external bankers for deals, citing their high costs and incentives to push transactions through. The denial came in response to stories from Semafor and Reuters claiming Berkshire had tapped Goldman following a competitor's interest in Norfolk Southern.</p>

          <p>This long-form travelogue traces the footsteps of author John le Carré (David Cornwell) in Corfu, Greece, a key setting in his novel "A Perfect Spy." The article delves into how le Carré's own life, particularly his relationship with his con-man father, Ronnie, deeply influenced his fiction, blurring the lines between espionage, betrayal, and personal history. The author reflects on le Carré's use of travel, secrecy, and infidelity as escapes, creating a double life that mirrored the clandestine world of his characters. Corfu itself, with its layered history of foreign powers, serves as a metaphor for the fragmented identities he explored.</p>
