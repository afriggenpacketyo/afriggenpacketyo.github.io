          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock rise significantly after a U.S. federal judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in a major antitrust case. The court determined that Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search but will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The ruling also permits Google to continue paying companies like Apple to be the default search engine on their devices, though exclusive contracts are now barred. This outcome is viewed as a major victory for Google, removing a significant legal and financial overhang from the company. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has transformed significantly throughout history, reflecting societal shifts in how childhood itself is perceived. Early art often featured children as religious figures like Jesus or as miniature adults in noble portraits used for political matchmaking, with their futures predetermined. As society evolved, art began to capture a wider range of childhood experiences, from the romanticized poverty of street urchins to the idealized, carefree play of the bourgeois era. The advent of photography and smartphones has further democratized and complicated the portrayal of children, raising new questions about privacy and consent in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Morgan Stanley are predicting a significant improvement for China's struggling property market in the latter half of the year, following a difficult first half. The report suggests that the pace of decline in sales and profitability for major developers will slow considerably, with a potential sales pickup in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook is based on developers' guidance for margin recovery and growth in rental income, as well as a large stock of available homes in major cities. The forecast offers a note of hope for a sector that has been in a slump for nearly five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sports columnist makes a bold prediction that the Los Angeles Rams will make it to the Super Bowl this season, citing several key factors for their potential success. The argument is built on the team's ascending young defense, a strengthened receiving corps with the addition of Davante Adams, and the leadership of coach Sean McVay and quarterback Matthew Stafford. The column suggests that offseason improvements have addressed key weaknesses exposed in last season's narrow playoff loss. With a relatively favorable schedule and a weakened division, the team is positioned for a deep postseason run if it can remain healthy.</p>
