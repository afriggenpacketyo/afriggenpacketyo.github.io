          <p>CNBC's Make It Book Club will feature "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki in June. The book addresses whether it is foolish to believe people are fundamentally decent, arguing that optimism is supported by science and leads to better outcomes. Zaki suggests a mindset shift towards "hopeful skepticism" can be learned by anyone, with research indicating that cynics are often unhealthier, sadder, poorer, and more often incorrect. The book is positioned as particularly relevant for these complicated times, marked by division and distrust. </p>

The couple, known for their show "Chrisley Knows Best," had been serving prison sentences since 2022. Their pardon comes after they alleged serious government misconduct, including an illegal raid and false testimony. Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention, thanking Trump for standing up against political prosecutions, and their lawyer argued they were targeted for their conservative views.</p>

          <p>The reality comedy "Duck Dynasty" is returning to A&E, mirroring a sense of restoration similar to the political landscape. The show, focused on the Robertson family and their duck-call business, gained popularity by representing traditionalist, Christian, and rural lifestyles often absent from mainstream pop culture. The revival attempts to recapture the original fun while also acknowledging how fame has changed the family and the potential for a new generation to lead the brand. The original series ended in 2017, but the new show highlights themes of generational change, family, and faith, with some cast members having publicly supported Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump expressed reservations about the size of a Boeing 747-8 gifted by the government of Qatar to replace Air Force One, despite initially accepting the offer. Trump described the plane as "much too big" and questioned its practicality, even though he acknowledged it as a "beautiful, big, magnificent, free airplane." The original offer from Qatar drew criticism from both parties, with some calling it "the definition of corruption." The White House insists the jet is a gift to the country, not to Trump personally.</p>

          <p>Financial experts advise college graduates to start saving for retirement early to take advantage of compound interest and long-term market benefits. Despite potential budget constraints, establishing a routine of investing at a young age is crucial for long-term financial stability. Diversified index funds, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), are recommended for beginners, with a heavier focus on stocks for younger investors. Experts recommend that new investors research themes that they are passionate about, whether that be AI or natural resources or cryptocurrency, and consider more targeted investments that could produce outsize returns.

          <p>Toyota is targeting significant growth in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) amid regulatory uncertainty and slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume last year to roughly 20% by 2030. Toyota plans to increase, perpetually increase, the amount of miles you can drive on EV-only range. This shift comes as automakers try to meet federal fuel economy standards and emissions regulations.</p>

          <p>Joby Aviation shares jumped 28% after the electric air taxi maker received $250 million from Toyota. This payment is part of a previously announced deal for the carmaker to invest $500 million in the company to support certification and commercial production of its electric air taxis. The CEO of Joby Aviation said the company is already seeing the benefit of working with Toyota in streamlining manufacturing processes and optimizing design. Toyota announced the deal in October.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Cats Distinguish Owner's Scent from Stranger's</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that domestic cats can differentiate between the scent of their owner and that of a stranger. Researchers at Tokyo University of Agriculture found that cats spent significantly longer sniffing tubes containing the odors of unknown people compared to those of their owner. This indicates cats can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar humans based on their odor, although it is unclear if they can identify specific people. Previous studies have shown cats recognize voices and interpret gazes.</p>
