          <h2>Browns Coach Downplays Significance of Quarterback Order at Rookie Minicamp</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 17:04:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterbacks Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders participated in their first minicamp practice, with Gabriel taking the first snap. However, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski cautioned against reading too much into the order, stating that the team will evaluate all quarterbacks throughout the spring. The Browns have a crowded quarterback room with Deshaun Watson's status uncertain due to an Achilles injury, along with Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco also on the roster. Stefanski emphasized that the team has a plan for determining the Week 1 starter and that the evaluation process is all-encompassing.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill. With Republican control of the White House and Congress, lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation. However, the narrow Republican majority in the House and demands for fiscal responsibility could complicate the process. Policy experts highlight key tax proposals that could significantly impact millions of Americans, as lawmakers aim to finalize the legislation.</p>

The Teal Wand uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample, which women will mail to a lab to screen for HPV.

At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, including Australia and Sweden.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a wayward Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years and splashed down in the Indian Ocean. Launched in 1972, the spacecraft became stranded in Earth‚Äôs orbit after a rocket booster malfunctioned. The event is a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitious Venera program, which achieved several firsts in exploring Venus. While the re-entry is not unusual, it highlights the increasing number of objects falling from the sky as nations and companies launch more hardware into orbit.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's manager, Bompastor, emphasized "consistency" to sum up the team's campaign, marked by a "transitional season" after the departure of Emma Hayes. The team secured the title by grinding out results, often winning by narrow margins and scoring late goals. They achieved six victories in six matches against other top-four teams, finishing 12 points clear with 19 wins and three draws. Despite the challenges, Chelsea remains the best team in England for the past five years.</p>
