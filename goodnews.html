          <p>Jimmie Ward, a Houston Texans safety, was arrested on a felony assault charge related to a family member. Ward's attorney asserts that the NFL player will be "vindicated" as they investigate the allegations against him. The attorney suggests that professional athletes often endure such situations and that they are thoroughly investigating the accuser's history. Ward's legal team has also filed a motion to modify his bond agreement due to the GPS ankle monitor interfering with his profession. The case is scheduled to be back in court in July.</p>

This action aims to encourage manufacturers, retailers, and consumers to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products.
