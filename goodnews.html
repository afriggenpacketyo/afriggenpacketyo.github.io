        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Baltimore Ravens, reeling from a 1-5 start and four straight losses, are optimistic about quarterback Lamar Jackson's return in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. Head coach John Harbaugh indicated Jackson, sidelined for two games with a hamstring injury, is expected to play, though he added a note of caution about future predictions. The team's offense has struggled significantly in his absence, managing only 13 points combined in their last two outings with backup quarterbacks. Jackson, a two-time MVP, is considered vital for revitalizing the team and mounting a potential playoff challenge, despite their current uphill battle.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced a strategic adjustment to their pitching rotation for the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, postponing Shohei Ohtani's next start. Manager Dave Roberts confirmed that Yoshinobu Yamamoto will now take the mound for Game 2, pushing Ohtani's appearance to a later, unspecified point in the series. This decision allows Yamamoto to adhere to his preferred five-day rest schedule, making him available for a potential Game 6. The shuffle also provides Ohtani additional time to concentrate solely on his batting, following a recent slump in the NL Division Series, which Roberts hopes will lead to improved offensive output.</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia is taking action to counter and remove "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic gold medalist Mollie O’Callaghan regarding transgender athlete Lia Thomas. Social media posts on platforms such as Facebook and X claimed O’Callaghan would refuse to participate in the 2028 LA Games if transgender swimmers competed, and included a provocative statement criticizing sharing a pool with Thomas. Swimming Australia has publicly supported O’Callaghan, confirming she never made these comments, and has formally requested Meta to remove the misleading posts. This incident highlights the challenges athletes face with misinformation, especially concerning sensitive topics like inclusion in sports.</p>

It also highlights a diplomatic spat, with the U.S. ambassador to Israel calling the UK Education Secretary "delusional" for claiming a key role in the truce. Germany, meanwhile, plans to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction and reassess arms export restrictions to Israel.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Adult Friendships: Strategies to Combat "Ghosting" and Maintain Bonds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the inherent difficulties of sustaining adult friendships, often resulting in "ghosting" as individuals navigate evolving life stages encompassing work, family, and myriad other responsibilities. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco highlights research indicating that approximately half of all friendships are lost every seven years, primarily due to shifting circumstances rather than fundamental incompatibility. Relationship experts advocate for transparent communication, embracing vulnerability, and innovative ways to connect, even through routine activities, as essential for preserving bonds. The article underscores the significant scientific evidence supporting the role of diverse social circles in reducing mortality risk and mitigating "relational loneliness," ultimately encouraging individuals to embrace the complexities of life and trust in the enduring support of their friends.</p>

          <h2>Thermal Cameras Detect Stress Levels by Measuring Nose Temperature Drop</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are using thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature can objectively measure stress levels and monitor recovery. During an experimental stress test, volunteers' noses, including a BBC reporter's, showed a temperature dip of two to six degrees as blood flow shifted away from the nose to the eyes and ears—an innate physical response to perceived danger. This non-invasive technique, which measures a biological blood flow shift, is considered a "game changer" for stress research. It could help manage harmful stress levels, identify anxiety/depression risks, and monitor stress in non-communicative individuals like babies and even great apes.</p>

          <h2>IFS Warns UK Chancellor Against "Half-Baked" Tax Fixes in Upcoming Budget</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:21:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), an influential UK economic think tank, has cautioned Chancellor Rachel Reeves against implementing "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in her upcoming Budget as she aims to boost government tax revenue. Facing pressure to adhere to self-imposed fiscal rules, the IFS warns that certain tax increases could prove "especially economically harmful." The article suggests that achieving significant revenue gains without violating manifesto pledges—which preclude hikes to income tax, National Insurance, or VAT for working people—necessitates comprehensive systemic reform. The IFS specifically recommends overhauling property tax and capital gains tax as optimal starting points for establishing a fairer and more growth-conducive tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Dow Futures Surge as Markets Anticipate "TACO Trade" Following Trump's Calming China Remarks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 18:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dow futures experienced a significant jump of over 300 points, signaling an anticipated market rebound after President Trump's seemingly conciliatory comments on China tariffs. Following his Friday announcement of new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump posted on Truth Social, stating, "Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!" This notable shift in rhetoric has led market analysts to interpret the tariffs as a negotiating tactic, often referred to as the "TACO (Trump always chickens out) trade." Vice President Vance further indicated the U.S. willingness for reasonableness if China reciprocates. While Beijing maintains a defiant stance, market veterans largely expect both nations to ultimately de-escalate tensions to avert a global recession. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paramount, supported by billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David, has formally commenced bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, though its initial offer of approximately $20 per share was rejected. Despite this setback, discussions are continuing, and Paramount is reportedly preparing a revised bid for the media conglomerate, which includes HBO, CNN, and the prolific Warner Bros. studios. This potential merger, fueled by Paramount's strategic need for expanded content to effectively compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon, could profoundly reconfigure the Hollywood landscape, potentially leading to substantial consolidation and the integration of CNN with Paramount-owned CBS News. The impending urgency is further amplified by Warner Bros. Discovery's announced plan to divide its assets by next April.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping recently convened, signaling a potential recalibration in their historically complex relationship, with Modi emphasizing the imperative for the two Asian powers to function as "partners" rather than "rivals." This article highlights India's strategic decision to "pursue strategic autonomy" and avoid perceiving bilateral relations solely through a "third country lens," particularly in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpectedly firm stance on India. Both leaders envision robust Sino-Indian ties as a cornerstone for a multipolar global order and a burgeoning Asian century. The resumption of direct flights and invitations for upcoming summits underscore India's hedging strategy to cultivate a coalition of eastern powers.</p>
