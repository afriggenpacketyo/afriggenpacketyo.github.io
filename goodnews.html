          <h2>India Considers Zero Tariffs on U.S. Imports Amid Trade Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 03:04:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, on a reciprocal basis. This move signals a potential shift away from India's protectionist trade policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. However, some analysts caution that India will need to carefully balance the benefits of a deal with the need to protect its domestic manufacturing industries.</p>

          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, viewed as a critical test of the country's democratic progress and its aspirations for EU membership. Prime Minister Edi Rama and his Socialist Party are seeking a fourth consecutive term, while the opposition remains fragmented. The election is seen as a decisive moment for Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and implementing reforms required by the EU. However, analysts caution that EU membership is primarily a technical process requiring sustainable institutional reform, not just political slogans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While overall exports jumped 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21%. The rise in exports to ASEAN countries, particularly Vietnam and Malaysia, indicates a shift in trade patterns. Experts suggest that the surge may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, and they anticipate trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale explores how cities can adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change. The exhibition, titled "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial.

Architects and urban planners are urged to prioritize solutions such as increasing green spaces and implementing water-permeable surfaces. The biennale aims to spark a global "construction revolution" to create climate-resilient cities.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is planning to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to comply with U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity compared to the original design. This move reflects Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, while adhering to Washington's restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. Downstream customers may potentially modify the module configuration to adjust the chip's performance levels.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a decline of nearly 7% following a first-quarter earnings miss. The company's revenue and profit attributable to shareholders both fell short of estimates, attributed to "production fluctuations" that led to falling blended average selling prices. Despite this, SMIC reported an increase in wafer shipments and a high capacity utilization rate. The company attributed some of its growth to customer shipment pull-ins due to geopolitical changes and increased demand driven by government policies.</p>
