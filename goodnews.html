          <p>Arsenal has finalized the signing of Spanish midfielder Martin Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for a fee of nearly £60 million. The 26-year-old deep-lying midfielder has agreed to a five-year contract with the London-based club. This marks Arsenal's second major acquisition of the summer transfer window, following the arrival of goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga. Zubimendi, who came through Real Sociedad's youth academy, made 236 appearances for the Spanish team before making the move to the Premier League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent cultural moments, such as Beyoncé's "Cowboy Carter," have highlighted a trend of Black artists reclaiming the American flag, prompting a discussion about its complex symbolism. For many Black Americans, the flag represents both a history of oppression and the ideals of a nation they helped build, creating a complicated relationship of pain and pride. This reclamation is seen by some as a signal of belonging and progress, particularly for younger generations further removed from the Jim Crow era. The article explores this evolving dynamic, considering the history of Black military service and the diverse perspectives within the Black community.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has announced a £500 million plan to expand "Best Start" family hubs to every local authority in England by 2026. These hubs are designed to provide a wide range of services for families, from midwifery and birth registration to debt advice and youth clubs, aiming to support 500,000 more children in disadvantaged areas. The initiative builds on the previous Sure Start and Conservative-era family hub models, with the current government promising to go further by revitalizing and expanding these crucial family services. The plan has been welcomed by children's charities as a positive step.</p>

          <p>The 18-year-old cold case of Jennifer Kesse, who vanished from her Orlando apartment in 2006, has been declared active again by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). This significant development comes after new DNA evidence was obtained and persons of interest were narrowed down, providing renewed hope for her family. Kesse's father, who had previously sued the city for the case files and assembled his own investigative team, credits their persistence and new technology for the breakthrough. The investigation is now focused on identifying a suspect seen on camera parking Kesse's car after her disappearance.</p>

          <p>A recent study from the Africa Centre for Strategic Studies describes the military relationship between China and Tanzania as exceptionally special and unlike any other on the African continent. According to the report, Tanzania's military structure, including its inventory, doctrines, and order of battle, is heavily influenced by the People's Liberation Army (PLA). This deep connection is rooted in historical ties, as Tanzania is one of several African nations where a liberation movement party has maintained power since independence, fostering close and enduring bonds with China.</p>

          <p>A group of whitewater boaters staged a unique protest by carrying a raft for 16 miles along a dewatered section of the Kern River in California. They aimed to highlight how Southern California Edison's Fairview Dam diverts most of the river's flow for hydropower, leaving a popular stretch impassable for rafting and kayaking. As the utility seeks to renew its federal license, boaters and local businesses are demanding that new regulations ensure minimum flows to support the region's recreation-based economy. The protest underscores the conflict between clean energy generation and preserving natural river ecosystems.</p>

          <p>An enduring and mutually influential relationship exists between the CIA and Hollywood, extending beyond simple on-screen portrayals. The intelligence agency has historically collaborated with and recruited talent from the entertainment industry, utilizing skills from makeup artists for disguises to storytellers for complex operations, as seen in the "Argo" mission. This collaboration continues today, with the CIA seeking creative and tech-savvy professionals while also engaging with productions to shape its public image and inspire a new generation of spies. The dynamic reveals how spycraft sometimes requires stagecraft to solve real-world intelligence challenges.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning with sustained winds of 50 mph. The storm, the third of the Atlantic hurricane season, is moving north and is expected to weaken to a tropical depression as it moves further inland. Tropical storm warnings were in effect for parts of the North and South Carolina coastline, with authorities cautioning about the risk of flash flooding due to heavy rainfall. Flood watches have been issued for several areas, including Myrtle Beach and Raleigh, as the storm is forecast to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created a new data sorting system that is faster and more energy-efficient, potentially overcoming a key bottleneck in computing. The system uses memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities, combined with a new algorithm to perform "sort-in-memory" operations. This approach avoids the data transfer limitations of traditional computer architecture, where processing and memory are separate. The team from Peking University demonstrated the prototype's effectiveness in tasks like route finding, showing significant improvements in both speed and energy use for applications in AI and scientific computing.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed a form of congenital deafness in a clinical trial. The therapy delivers a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, correcting a mutation that prevents the transmission of sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial, including children and adults, showed significant hearing improvement within months, with one seven-year-old regaining nearly full hearing. The research, deemed safe and well-tolerated, offers hope for treating other forms of genetic hearing loss in the future.</p>
