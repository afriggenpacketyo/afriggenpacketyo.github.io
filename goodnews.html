          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery to remove between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets he had ingested, resulting in the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, purchased online, clamped together inside his digestive system, forming four chains that caused pressure necrosis, or tissue death. The case report highlights the dangers of these small, powerful magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys but can cause severe internal injuries if swallowed. The teen has since recovered and was discharged from the hospital after an eight-day stay.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that for the average person, saving money through practical habits like bulk shopping can be a more effective financial strategy than trying to pick winning stocks. He argues that it's difficult to consistently outperform the market, but significant savings can be achieved by buying household consumables in large quantities. Cuban calculated that saving 40% on a $2,000 annual budget for essentials yields a guaranteed return of $800. He emphasizes, however, that this strategy is only beneficial if done with cash, cautioning against accumulating credit card debt for such purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of recovery, inspiring global river restoration movements. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, native plants are blooming, and wildlife is returning to the revitalized ecosystem. To celebrate the milestone, 28 Indigenous teenagers became the first to kayak the full length of the river in more than 100 years. This successful restoration serves as a powerful model for other Indigenous-led conservation efforts worldwide, demonstrating that large-scale ecological healing is possible.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes surged to record highs this week, buoyed by encouraging economic data and strong corporate earnings reports. A key driver was the September consumer price index, which showed inflation rising less than anticipated, increasing the likelihood of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Despite the ongoing government shutdown, approximately 87% of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have exceeded earnings expectations. This positive performance in the market has overshadowed concerns related to the shutdown and ongoing trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Located just blocks from the White House, the Octagon House stands as one of Washington D.C.'s oldest and most historically significant residences, with a reputation for being haunted. Completed in 1801, the home temporarily housed President James Madison and his wife Dolley after the White House was burned in 1814, and it was where the treaty ending the War of 1812 was signed. Over the centuries, occupants and visitors have reported numerous unexplained events, such as doors opening on their own and the scent of lilacs associated with Dolley Madison's presence. The building is now a museum undergoing renovations for America's 250th anniversary.</p>

          <p>Left-wing independent Catherine Connolly is set to be the next president of Ireland after her main rival, Heather Humphreys of the Fine Gael party, conceded defeat. Although vote counting is still in progress, polls had consistently shown strong support for Connolly in the race for the largely ceremonial role. Connolly, a former barrister and an independent lawmaker since 2016, has been an outspoken critic of Israel's actions in Gaza and gained the backing of several left-leaning parties. She will succeed Michael D. Higgins, who served the maximum two seven-year terms.</p>

          <p>U.S. national champion Amber Glenn won the Cup of China figure skating competition for the second year in a row, narrowly defeating her American teammate Alysa Liu. Glenn, who was dealing with neck pain, delivered a strong free skate performance to move up from third place after the short program. Her final score of 214.78 was just enough to edge out Liu's 212.07. The victory marks a significant achievement for Glenn, while Liu secured her first-ever podium finish at a Grand Prix event, placing second in the competition.</p>

          <p>Early voting has officially begun in New York City and New Jersey for two closely watched off-year elections. New Yorkers are choosing a new mayor, while New Jersey residents are selecting their next governor. These races are seen by some as potential bellwethers for the Democratic party, testing the appeal of different candidate profiles ahead of future national elections. The contests have highlighted key issues such as affordability and have also exposed ongoing ideological divisions within the Democratic party. Early voting will continue until early November before Election Day on November 4th.</p>

He reportedly headed the drafting team and played a "decisive role" in shaping the economic and social blueprint for the nation. The framework was developed based on extensive investigations conducted during Xi's tours across China throughout the year. The Politburo Standing Committee made multiple revisions before the plan was presented to the Central Committee for deliberation, underscoring the president's deep involvement in the policy-making process.</p>

While not officially committing to a 2028 campaign, she said it was a possibility and that she sees her career as one of public service. Harris also used the interview to criticize former President Donald Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" and asserting that her campaign warnings about his authoritarian tendencies have been proven correct.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing trend of "sleepmaxxing," or using technology to optimize rest, has created a multi-billion dollar industry of gadgets like smart mattresses, rings, and headbands. However, this reliance on tech can backfire, as demonstrated when an Amazon Web Services outage caused Eight Sleep smart beds to malfunction, trapping some users in upright positions or at extreme temperatures. While some devices can aid those with medical sleep disorders, the increasing cyborg-like dependence on technology introduces new points of failure into the simple act of sleeping. This raises questions about whether over-engineering rest is more disruptive than beneficial.</p>

The club's success is attributed to a philosophy blending star power, like designated player Hirving "Chucky" Lozano, with a strong collective team spirit. A core part of their strategy is the Right to Dream academy, which focuses on developing homegrown talent from the San Diego and Tijuana regions.

          <p>Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, following the resignation of Angela Rayner. Powell's victory comes just seven weeks after she was dismissed from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cabinet during a reshuffle, marking a swift return to a senior party role. While her win was not a landslide, it is seen as an expression of the party's current unease as it struggles in elections and with internal disputes. Following the announcement, Powell met with Starmer, and she has indicated her critiques of the party's direction will primarily be voiced privately.</p>
