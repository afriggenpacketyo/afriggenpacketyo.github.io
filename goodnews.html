          <p>Shakira captivated audiences at Inglewood’s SoFi Stadium, performing a two-night engagement as part of her "Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran" world tour, which examines her recent breakup. The high-energy show featured elaborate choreography, including a unique "living stationary bike" using dancers, and a live, on-camera costume change during her performance of "Chantaje." Highlights included a powerful, rock-infused rendition of "Don't Bother" and a fan-campaign-inspired performance of "Men in This Town." The Colombian superstar also thrilled the crowd with a surprise guest appearance by Snoop Dogg, further elevating the dynamic and memorable concerts.</p>

          <p>Four Barbary lion cubs—three females and one male—recently made their public debut at Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic. This subspecies, once native to northern Africa, has been extinct in the wild since the 1960s. The cubs are a crucial part of an international endangered species program that aims to eventually reintroduce the breed to its native habitat. While a "far distant future" goal, initial discussions with Moroccan authorities and a planned expert conference are exploring the feasibility of returning these majestic animals to the Atlas Mountains.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is navigating a "big summer" of frustrating transfer challenges, despite achieving Champions League qualification and winning their first trophy in 17 years. The club has reportedly lost out on several key targets and faces significant uncertainty over retaining star player Alexander Isak, who is the subject of a substantial bid from Liverpool. This comes amidst considerable upheaval in the club's senior management, including the recent departures of the sporting director and CEO. These internal issues, coupled with tight financial regulations, raise questions about the Saudi-backed club's ability to compete with football's elite.</p>

Upcoming earnings reports from key companies like Eli Lilly, AppLovin, Airbnb, and DraftKings are highlighted, alongside the increasing importance of weekly jobless claims data following last week's disappointing jobs report.

          <p>A committee of Italian ministers has given its approval to long-debated plans for a 3.3-kilometer bridge connecting the island of Sicily to mainland Italy across the Strait of Messina, with completion targeted by 2032. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition government hails the €13.5 billion state-funded project as a vital economic boost for Italy's less affluent southern regions, and a symbol of national ambition. However, critics vehemently oppose the project, citing serious concerns about constructing a record-long bridge in an active earthquake zone, potential environmental damage, and fears of mafia infiltration in the lucrative construction contracts.</p>

This long-awaited identification, confirmed through DNA testing with 99.9994% certainty, finally provides closure for White's family and the dedicated search and rescue members who had been haunted by the mystery for 28 years.</p>

          <p>The apparent suicide of 32-year-old Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, found dead in her bathroom with a gunshot wound, was revealed to be a murder through a crucial piece of evidence. Detectives found a metal ring from the bathroom door lock underneath her body, contradicting Matthew Ecker's claim that he broke the door open *after* hearing the shot. This discovery suggested the door was forced open *before* she was shot, implying an argument and her attempt to escape. Ecker, the only other person present, was subsequently charged with second-degree murder, convicted in February 2024, and sentenced to 30 years, bringing justice to the case.</p>
