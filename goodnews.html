          <p>Chinese humanoid robotics startup X Square Robot has secured approximately $100 million in a new funding round led by Alibaba Cloud, bringing its total investment to around $280 million. The Shenzhen-based company, which aims to create "robotic butlers" within five years, also released an open-source AI foundation model to accelerate development in the field. This investment highlights the growing venture capital interest in combining generative AI with robotics to create machines capable of complex, autonomous tasks. The company plans to prepare for an IPO next year, targeting markets like schools, hotels, and retirement homes. (not investment advice)</p>

Alcaraz dominated most of the match, dropping only the second set, and his victory will return him to the world No. 1 ranking.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by Chinese and American scientists has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core, a discovery that challenges previous planetary models. By analyzing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, researchers determined the core has a radius of about 600 kilometers. This finding is significant because Mars was not expected to have cooled sufficiently to form a solid core, similar to those of Earth and the Moon. The discovery could also renew scientific debate about whether Mars once had plate tectonics, a key geological process on Earth.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index saw a significant 1.5% increase after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his intention to resign over the weekend. The market's positive reaction is reportedly tied to excitement over potential successors, such as Takaichi Sanae, who is seen as pro-growth and keen on deregulation. This political shift comes amid rising Japanese government bond yields, driven by persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. The resignation introduces a period of political uncertainty, but investors appear optimistic about the potential for new leadership to stimulate the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has announced an agreement with the United States to release its citizens who were detained during a large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai battery facility in Georgia. A chartered plane is being arranged to bring the workers home, and officials are working to improve the visa system to prevent future incidents. The raid, which detained over 300 South Korean nationals, had caused diplomatic concern in Seoul, especially given the significant investments South Korean companies are making in U.S. manufacturing. The White House defended the raid as necessary to protect American jobs.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman named Charlotte Robinson experienced a "cryptic pregnancy," having no idea she was pregnant until she gave birth to her son in a toilet at a football club in Lowestoft, Suffolk. She had not felt the baby move and attributed her hip pain to a pre-existing condition from a previous birth. After feeling a sudden urge to push in the restroom, she delivered the baby herself before her husband and mother-in-law came to her aid. Experts note that such cases, while rare, affect about one in 2,500 births in the UK.</p>

          <p>The article highlights the growing trend of couples "living apart together" (LAT), focusing on a woman who has been happily married for 15 years while living in London, separate from her husband in Australia. This arrangement allows both partners to pursue different life goals and careers without ending their marriage, maintaining their connection through regular communication. While unconventional, this lifestyle is also practiced by some high-profile couples who find it helps maintain independence and keeps the relationship fresh. Experts suggest that for some, having separate spaces can strengthen a marriage by preserving individual identity.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for one million dollars, ensuring its preservation and eventual reopening ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2026. The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and a subsequent ownership dispute. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the few remaining of its kind and features horses carved by famed artist Charles Looff. The city plans significant repairs as part of a broader restoration of the park before the 2028 Olympic Games.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Bank of America research, global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, shifting capital toward Asia. This trend is driven by the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence boom, a weakening U.S. dollar, and expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now seeing better valuations and growth opportunities in Asian markets. The global AI market is projected to grow substantially by 2030, with a significant portion of that investment expected in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse on Sunday night created a "Blood Moon," a spectacle visible to observers across Asia, Australia, and parts of Europe and Africa. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth aligns perfectly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish hue. This color results from sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and illuminate the moon. The event has been a source of wonder and fascination for cultures throughout human history.</p>

          <p>Customs officials in Nigeria have intercepted an illegal shipment of more than 1,600 parrots and canaries that were being smuggled from Lagos to Kuwait without the required permits. This seizure highlights Nigeria's role as a hub for the illicit wildlife trade, a multi-billion dollar global industry that threatens biodiversity. The illegal trade of animals endangers the creatures themselves, disrupts local ecosystems by removing native species, and risks introducing invasive species to new environments. Conservation groups emphasize the need for stronger enforcement of international agreements to combat this pervasive problem.</p>
