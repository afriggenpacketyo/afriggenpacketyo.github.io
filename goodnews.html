          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst expectations and marking a strong recovery from a loss in the same period last year. Despite mixed results in its investment banking unit and challenges from currency fluctuations, the bank's overall revenue remained steady at €7.8 billion. The positive earnings report, along with an improved capital ratio, has bolstered investor confidence, pushing the company's shares up by nearly 6% and signaling that the bank is on track to meet its full-year targets.

          <p>The UK and India are set to formalize a significant free trade agreement, which will be signed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This landmark deal aims to reduce tariffs on goods such as British whisky and cars while increasing the UK's access to Indian products like textiles and gemstones. The agreement, which follows nearly three years of negotiations, is projected to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually and increase bilateral trade by an additional £25.5 billion a year by 2040.</p>

This policy shift comes as Beijing faces mounting demographic pressures and seeks to bolster its social safety net to support its rapidly aging population. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, ruling that the plan is unconstitutional. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment's Citizenship Clause is incorrect and that denying citizenship to many people born in the United States would be unlawful. This ruling keeps a nationwide injunction in place and moves the contentious issue closer to a potential review by the Supreme Court.</p>
