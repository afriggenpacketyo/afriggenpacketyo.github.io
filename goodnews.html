          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from their federal deployment in Los Angeles, reducing the total force by half. These troops were federalized by President Trump over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom to address protests related to federal immigration enforcement. While the administration claims the withdrawal is possible because "lawlessness is subsiding," Governor Newsom criticized the initial deployment as a political maneuver and called for the remaining troops to be sent home. The deployment had sparked a legal battle over presidential authority to federalize state guards without gubernatorial consent.</p>

          <p>Congress is considering the "Genius Act," a bipartisan bill aimed at creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation would define stablecoins legally and establish consumer protections, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own versions. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, positioning them as "digital dollars." The push is part of a broader effort by some lawmakers and the Trump administration to support the cryptocurrency industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's leading journal, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated his country's support for economic globalization and free trade. He spoke out against rising unilateralism and protectionism, specifically opposing trade barriers and unilateral sanctions. The article compiles statements made by Xi since 2012, positioning China as a champion of an open global economy in contrast to the more protectionist policies of other nations. Xi also pledged that China would uphold "genuine multilateralism" to promote an inclusive and beneficial global economic system for all participants.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments in China to use their legislative powers to stimulate economic development. It argues that tailored local laws create a stable and predictable environment, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. Since legislative powers were expanded to more cities in 2015, local lawmaking has become a crucial tool for governance, shifting from top-down directives to a more systemic approach. The article emphasizes that successful local legislation must adapt to the evolving needs of economic and social development.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Crossbreed Corals from Honduras and Florida to Restore Reefs</h2>

          <p>In a pioneering effort to save Florida's dying coral reefs, marine scientists are crossbreeding native Elkhorn coral with a hardier strain from Honduras. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been lost due to warming oceans and disease, threatening coastal protection from storm surges. The Honduran coral, accustomed to tougher conditions, was brought to Florida labs to create a hybrid "Flonduran" species, which has now been planted on wild reefs for the first time. Scientists hope this new, more resilient coral can survive future marine heatwaves and serve as a critical step in scaling up reef restoration efforts.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming 2025 NFL season, generating a wide range of reactions from fans and players. The first, a bold all-gold "Charger Power" uniform, marks the first time the team will wear gold jerseys in a game. The second is a navy blue "Super Chargers" set, designed as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s. While some praised the new designs, others online humorously compared the all-gold look to mustard bottles, Big Bird, or the Savannah Bananas baseball team.</p>

Under the deal, the United States will impose a lower 19% tariff, while Indonesia has committed to significant purchases of American products. These commitments include $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and an order for 50 Boeing jets. The agreement is one of several the administration has been pursuing as it uses the threat of steep, country-specific tariffs to renegotiate trade relationships and secure more favorable terms for American businesses and exports.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are purchasing gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows nations to bolster their reserves using local currency, thereby preserving foreign exchange assets like the U.S. dollar. This method is often cheaper, supports the local mining industry, and helps formalize a sector sometimes linked to illegal practices. Countries like Ghana, Colombia, and the Philippines are using this approach to build reserves amid soaring gold prices and global geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence, such as a cast on his arm, that made his involvement unlikely. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022 after a review initiated by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The settlement resolves a federal lawsuit claiming that sheriff's detectives failed to disclose exculpatory evidence and used suggestive methods with witnesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid debate over the roles, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. It concluded that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles has led to confusion about their purpose and scope of practice. The recommendations follow concerns from families of patients who died after being treated by PAs whom they believed were fully qualified doctors.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million renovation project. The iconic Victorian glasshouse, which opened in 1848, requires extensive repairs as the hot, humid conditions inside have caused its ironwork to rust. The ambitious makeover will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, temporarily relocating 1,300 tropical plants, and upgrading the heating system to achieve net-zero emissions. Horticulturists have already begun the complex process of propagating and moving the priceless plant collection in preparation for the extensive restoration work.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advert for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can help people feel calm and reduce anxiety. The watchdog found that claims about the beverage's "Mindful Blend" of ingredients, including magnesium and ashwagandha, were not on the official register of permitted health claims for food products. The ASA ruled that language like "crafted for calm" would lead consumers to infer a prohibited health benefit. The company was ordered not to make claims that its drinks could prevent, treat, or cure human disease.</p>

          <p>A Seoul court has begun a retrial for Kim Jae-gyu, the former spy chief who assassinated South Korean dictator Park Chung-hee in 1979. Kim was executed for insurrection, but his family argues he was a patriot who acted to prevent bloodshed and restore democracy, not a traitor seeking power. The retrial, granted 46 years later, will re-examine whether his actions constituted treason, particularly in light of evidence that his original conviction in a military court was based on a flawed process and testimony obtained through torture. The case revisits a pivotal and deeply divisive moment in the nation's history.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly stated that Ukraine "shouldn't" use its military capabilities to strike the Russian capital of Moscow. This comment serves as a clarification following reports that he had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a phone call if Kyiv's forces *could* hit Moscow and St. Petersburg. The White House had previously claimed those reports took the president's words out of context, stating he was asking a question, not encouraging an attack. This more cautious public tone comes as the administration navigates its policy of supporting Ukraine while avoiding direct escalation with Russia.</p>
