          <p>Katie Piper, presenter and campaigner, spoke at the Hay Festival in Wales about her views on aging and beauty standards. She compared aging to a bereavement, noting that women often age out of the male gaze and face societal judgment. Piper, who underwent numerous surgeries after an attack in 2008, discussed her latest book, which explores themes of age, beauty, and self-acceptance. She expressed excitement about getting older, emphasizing the importance of self-identity and challenging societal expectations, stating that aging can be a key to living how one wants to live, free from others' expectations.</p>

          <p>The Polish presidential election is too close to call, with exit polls indicating a tight race between the two contenders. The vote is viewed as a significant test of populist nationalism's influence in Europe. Initial exit polls showed a neck-and-neck situation, making the final outcome uncertain. Both candidates have claimed victory, but the official results are expected to be released later. The narrow margin suggests a deeply divided electorate and highlights the ongoing ideological battles within Poland. </p>

          <p>The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) removed a list of ‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù states, cities, and counties from its website after facing criticism from the National Sheriffs‚Äô Association.

The list was created following an executive order from President Trump calling for a tally of sanctuary jurisdictions. Despite the removal, DHS stated it would continue to use the sanctuary tally, while leaders of some cities questioned the sanctuary label.</p>
