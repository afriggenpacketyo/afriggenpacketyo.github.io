          <p>The University of North Carolina Tar Heels achieved a decisive 41-6 victory over Richmond, marking the first home win under new head coach Bill Belichick. Quarterback Gio Lopez contributed three touchdowns, two through the air and one on the ground, while freshman Demon June rushed for 148 yards. The Tar Heels' defense was dominant, limiting Richmond to just 199 total yards and forcing three turnovers, including a fumble returned for a touchdown. This win follows the team's first victory of the Belichick era last week against Charlotte.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has launched a new pilot program to accelerate the integration of electric air taxis, also known as eVTOL aircraft. The initiative aims to establish new regulations and partnerships with private companies and local governments to foster American leadership in this emerging aviation sector. The three-year program will involve at least five pilot projects focusing on cargo delivery, emergency response, and eventually passenger transport. Companies like Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation have already announced their intent to participate, which will allow them to test their aircraft before completing the full FAA certification process.</p>

          <p>In response to historic droughts that have severely restricted global trade, the Panama Canal Authority is launching a multi-billion dollar infrastructure plan to ensure future water supply. The projects include building a new dam and tunnel system to supplement water levels in Lake Gatun, which is essential for the canal's lock operations. Additionally, a "land bridge" featuring a natural gas pipeline will be constructed to transport energy products across the isthmus without relying on the waterway. These long-term projects aim to mitigate the impacts of climate change on one of the world's most critical shipping routes.</p>

          <p>The UK's financial regulator has proposed allowing banks and card providers to set their own limits for contactless payments, potentially removing the current £100 cap entirely. This move has ignited a debate about consumer spending habits and security, as academics warn that eliminating the PIN requirement for larger purchases could lead to more impulsive spending and debt accumulation. While proponents argue the change aligns with the unlimited nature of mobile wallet payments, charities express concern about the potential for increased financial abuse. Banks have indicated they would allow customers to set their own personal limits if the proposal is adopted.</p>

          <p>German customs officials in Hamburg have arrested two men and seized over 400 kilograms of cocaine in a significant drug bust at the city's port. The operation was initiated after alert dock workers noticed two unrecognized men loading more than 20 sports bags from a ship into a car. Officers intervened as the suspects attempted to leave, apprehending one at the scene and the other after a wider search involving a helicopter. The port of Hamburg is a major entry point for narcotics into Europe, and authorities have recently warned of a "cocaine surge" affecting the continent.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Brentford is demonstrating the effectiveness of the long throw-in as a potent offensive tactic, a strategy reminiscent of Stoke City's approach over a decade ago. The team scored a crucial late goal against Chelsea originating from a long throw, marking the seventh such goal they have scored since the start of last season, more than any other team. Head coach Keith Andrews defends the tactic against accusations of being unsophisticated, emphasizing that any method that creates scoring chances is a valid tool. Pundits note that the unusual trajectory and resulting chaos make long throws difficult for opposing teams to defend against.</p>

          <p>Belfast's Lewis Crocker has claimed the vacant IBF welterweight world title after defeating Paddy Donovan by a split decision at Windsor Park. Crocker secured two crucial knockdowns in the third and fifth rounds, which proved decisive on the judges' scorecards. The victory was a moment of vindication for Crocker, who won their first fight by disqualification but was widely seen as the inferior boxer on that night. This improved performance elevates Crocker's professional record to 22-0 and positions him for potentially lucrative future fights against other big names in the welterweight division.</p>

The agreement covers finance, trade, tourism, and data exchange, positioning Hainan's free trade port as a complement to Hong Kong's established global financial hub. Hong Kong's expertise in asset management and legal services can provide the necessary infrastructure and credibility to support Hainan's growth.

          <p>Earl Richardson, the former president of Morgan State University who led a landmark lawsuit against the state of Maryland for underfunding its historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), has died at 81. His 15-year legal battle resulted in a historic $577 million settlement in 2021 for four of the state's HBCUs. Richardson's advocacy brought national attention to funding disparities faced by Black educational institutions across the country. During his tenure as president from 1984 to 2010, he oversaw a period of significant growth at Morgan State, doubling enrollment and expanding the campus.</p>

The 6ft 6in German forward headed in a cross in the first half, easing concerns about the team's offensive capabilities following the recent departure of star striker Alexander Isak. Woltemade's timely goal was particularly important as it was revealed that fellow new signing Yoane Wissa will be sidelined with an injury until October. The performance earned the record signing a standing ovation and a new chant from the supportive home crowd.</p>

          <p>The Thai government has lifted a long-standing ban, granting working rights to approximately 80,000 long-term refugees from Myanmar who reside in camps along the border. This policy shift is a response to severe cuts in international humanitarian aid, particularly from the United States, which have led to food shortages and rising malnutrition in the camps. The move is intended to allow refugees to become self-sufficient and support their families, while also potentially filling labor shortages in the local economy. The UN Refugee Agency has praised the decision as a positive step that could set a regional benchmark for refugee rights.</p>
