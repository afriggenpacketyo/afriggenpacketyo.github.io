        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether's value surged as the U.S. House passed the GENIUS Act, the first major crypto-focused legislation in the country, which now awaits the president's signature. The bill's passage, along with significant inflows into Ether-based ETFs, has shifted momentum in the cryptocurrency market, with ETH outperforming Bitcoin. Analysts suggest this could mark a potential trend reversal, establishing a new regulatory framework for stablecoins that future administrations will find difficult to overturn. The legislation's symbolism alone is seen as a major victory for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Historical Perspectives on Queerness Reveal Diverse Attitudes Across Eras and Cultures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 14:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A historical review of queerness demonstrates a wide spectrum of societal acceptance and persecution throughout history, long before the modern term existed. In antiquity, same-sex relationships were common, as seen with figures like Leonardo da Vinci and the Roman Emperor Hadrian, and even celebrated in some cultures like ancient Crete. However, the rise of Christianity led to centuries of stigmatization and severe punishment for non-binary gender expression and same-sex love, often justified by religious texts. The article highlights that diverse gender identities, such as a third gender, have been recognized in various cultures for millennia, challenging the modern binary model.</p>

          <h2>American Express Reports Strong Spending from Wealthy Customers, but Airline Transactions Stall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 14:45:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Express revealed that while overall spending by its affluent customer base remains strong, a notable exception is a slowdown in airline-related transactions. Spending on economy class domestic airfare was flat compared to the previous year, even as spending on premium cabins and expensive hotels saw significant increases. This weakness in a key travel sector, combined with falling airfare prices, could be a concern for the company, which has extensive airline partnerships. Despite beating quarterly expectations, Amex shares fell amid investor concerns about rising competition and the costs of its rewards programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Liberty star Sabrina Ionescu voiced her support for Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark, who will miss the WNBA All-Star Game and 3-point contest due to a groin injury. Ionescu emphasized that Clark's impact on basketball extends beyond her presence on the court, noting the excitement she generates for the sport regardless of whether she is playing. Having experienced similar injury setbacks early in her own career, Ionescu mentioned she has been a "sound board" for Clark during this frustrating time. Team Clark's coach, Sandy Brondello, confirmed Clark will still have a significant presence from the sidelines during the game.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated a challenge from Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the outcome, stating it affirms that asset-level rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. While Exxon stated it disagrees with the interpretation, it will respect the arbitration decision and welcome Chevron to the joint venture in Guyana.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Texas Roadhouse have recently underperformed the market, partly due to concerns over accelerating beef inflation, a major expense for the steakhouse chain. Beef prices rose approximately 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, putting pressure on the company's operating margins. Despite this challenge, analysts at Bank of America raised their price target for the stock, citing expectations that the company will continue to gain market share and post strong traffic trends. The long-term outlook for the business is viewed positively, even as the industry waits for cattle inventory to rebuild and prices to stabilize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British author Philippa Langley, known for helping discover the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the 500-year-old mystery of the two princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Her decade-long "Missing Princes Project" argues that the boys, Edward and Richard, were not murdered by their uncle Richard III but actually survived. Langley's research uncovered documents she believes point to the elder prince, Edward, living on under the name Lambert Simnel, who later led a rebellion. While the theory challenges the long-held narrative popularized by Tudor historians and Shakespeare, it has been met with skepticism from some academic experts.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man, Mark Sanfratello, has been extradited to Oregon to face a second-degree murder charge in the 1983 cold case death of his then-girlfriend, Teresa Peroni. Peroni, 27, was last seen with Sanfratello at a party before she was reported missing. Her skull was found in 1997, but the case remained unsolved until the Josephine County Sheriff's Office reopened it in 2024. Using modern forensic testing and re-interviewing witnesses, investigators gathered new evidence that led to Sanfratello's indictment and arrest. The Oregon Attorney General praised the persistence of law enforcement in seeking answers for Peroni's family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has adopted a new, stringent set of sanctions against Russia, aimed at crippling its ability to finance its war in Ukraine. The measures include a dynamic price cap on Russian oil, a ban on all future transactions via the Nord Stream pipelines, and an import ban on refined petroleum products made from Russian crude in third countries. Additionally, the EU sanctioned more Russian banks and numerous entities, including some in China and Turkey, for supplying Russia with dual-use technologies. While the EU hopes these actions strike at the heart of Russia's war economy, experts note that enforcement, particularly regarding Russia's "shadow fleet" of oil tankers, remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>The traditional five-day royal "swan upping" survey on the River Thames has concluded with positive news, showing a recovery in the number of young swans. The count found 115 cygnets, a significant increase from last year's 86, suggesting a reversal of a recent decline caused by avian flu and human-related incidents. The annual event, which dates back to the 12th century, involves counting, weighing, and checking the health of young swans along a stretch of the river. While once about asserting royal ownership, the tradition now focuses on conservation and educating the public, particularly young people, about protecting the iconic birds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that Americans' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with outlooks falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the tariff-induced price hikes will be temporary. The overall consumer sentiment index also increased slightly, aligning with economists' estimates and providing an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve as it monitors inflation expectations.

The team's top priority is keeping starters like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell healthy, as their success in October hinges on their availability. Additionally, the team is carefully managing Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching while hoping for a rebound from star players Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, whose offensive production has cooled.

          <p>For retirees relying on fixed Social Security benefits, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging as inflation rises. This article explores how individuals on Social Security can qualify for debt relief, noting that while their protected income status presents unique circumstances, options are available. Strategies like debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, are often a good fit as they don't require new credit checks. Other options include credit card hardship programs and, in some cases, debt settlement, though the latter can negatively impact credit scores. The key is finding a solution that aligns with a fixed-income reality. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of the airline industry shows that Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are increasingly pulling away from their competitors, accounting for over 86% of the profits among the seven largest carriers last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong global networks and a strategic focus on premium travelers, which has helped them better navigate a challenging market where domestic coach fares are falling. While both airlines have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, they point to the strength of their premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs as key advantages over rivals who are struggling to turn a profit even during peak travel seasons.
