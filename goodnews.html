          <p>China is promoting the establishment of a new development bank for the 10-nation Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes Russia and India. The initiative aims to provide member countries with an alternative to the US dollar-dominated trade system and accelerate key infrastructure projects. Analysts suggest the bank would help insulate the Eurasian group from financial risks associated with the dollar. The SCO has officially decided to establish the bank and is now working on the operational details for the financial institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare opportunity is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which enhances solar winds interacting with Earth's magnetic field. While northern regions typically have the best views, the lights could potentially be seen as far south as the Midlands. Visibility will depend on clear, dark skies, with experts advising people to move away from city light pollution for the best viewing experience.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break records, becoming the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in a single year. However, his journey at the US Open has been marked by persistent physical issues, including problems with his neck, shoulder, and back. While his performance level has improved throughout the tournament, his ability to withstand the physical demands of best-of-five-set matches against top opponents remains a significant concern. He faces a tough challenge against No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz in the next round.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for an initial fee of £18.1 million. Lammens, who has signed a five-year contract, is seen as a promising young talent with significant potential. The move addresses ongoing issues in United's goalkeeping department, where neither Andre Onana nor Altay Bayindir have been consistently convincing. Lammens is known for his exceptional shot-stopping ability, having prevented significantly more goals than expected for Antwerp last season based on statistical models.</p>

The policy, which began after a grace period, allows Executive cardholders to shop from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. on weekdays, with a shorter 30-minute window on Saturdays. The company stated the move is a reward for its most loyal members, though it has been met with some controversy. This change follows other recent updates at the wholesale club, including a transition from Pepsi to Coca-Cola products in its food courts.</p>

The only change from the previous team is Rasmus Hojgaard, who qualified automatically, replacing his twin brother Nicolai.

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores a crisis point in Kerr's life in 1997, when his first professional loss sent him into a spiral of substance abuse and personal turmoil. The film, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, also features Emily Blunt as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn. Johnson's performance is noted as a powerful depiction of the fighter's vulnerability, though the film is seen as a solid but not groundbreaking entry in the sports drama genre.</p>
