          <h2>US Border Encounters Fall to Record Lows in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:16:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported the lowest number of border encounters ever recorded for the month of June, with just 25,228 nationwide. The southern border saw only 6,072 apprehensions, a figure 15% lower than the previous record low in March. The Trump administration is crediting its stringent enforcement policies for the dramatic decline, which officials are calling the "Trump effect." Alongside the drop in crossings, the agency noted a significant increase in the seizure of drugs like methamphetamine and heroin, highlighting a multi-faceted approach to border security and enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard troops from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after they were deployed by President Trump to address protests. The deployment, which was made over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, was intended to protect federal immigration agents and property. Newsom criticized the move as making the Guard "political pawns" and has called for the remaining federalized troops to be returned to state control. The administration maintained the deployment was necessary to quell disorder, leading to a legal battle over presidential authority.</p>

          <h2>UK Health Review Recommends Renaming Physician Associates to Assistants for Patient Clarity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patient confusion. The review, commissioned by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors, and states they should not be diagnosing patients. This follows growing concerns over the roles' responsibilities and several high-profile cases where patients suffered harm after being treated by PAs they believed were qualified doctors. The recommendations aim to clarify their scope of practice within healthcare teams.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at addressing border security and providing a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. The legislation would create a seven-year "Dignity Program" for immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, requiring them to pass background checks and pay restitution. This legislative effort comes amid the Trump administration's mass deportation program and growing protests against ICE raids. Proponents argue the bill offers a practical solution beyond the binary choice of amnesty or deportation.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an extensive five-year renovation project estimated to cost £50 million. The historic Victorian glasshouse, which houses a tropical rainforest, requires major repairs due to rusting ironwork caused by its hot, humid internal climate. The project involves moving 1,300 plants, replacing 16,000 panes of glass with more insulated material, and upgrading the heating system to achieve net-zero emissions. This ambitious overhaul aims to preserve the architectural marvel for future generations while significantly improving its sustainability.</p>

          <p>The White House is marking a significant policy shift toward Russia by working with NATO allies to send more advanced weaponry, including 17 Patriot missile systems, to Ukraine. This move follows President Trump's increased frustration with Vladimir Putin's refusal to negotiate an end to the war. Under the new arrangement, NATO countries will provide the systems to Ukraine and then purchase replacements from the U.S. The Pentagon has also resumed shipments of previously paused munitions, including Patriot and Hellfire missiles, signaling a stronger, more coordinated effort to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 11,700 Afghans. The administration had planned to terminate the program, which provides deportation relief and work permits, arguing Afghanistan's security situation has improved. However, immigrant advocacy groups sued, contending the country remains unsafe and the decision was part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda. The court's one-week pause allows both sides to file briefs, offering a brief reprieve for Afghan nationals who faced the imminent loss of their protected status.</p>
