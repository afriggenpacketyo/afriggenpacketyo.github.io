She criticized the pardons as damaging to Americans' views of the federal government and expressed her inability to reconcile accepting a pardon when she believes she was guilty.

          <p>Ukraine's recent drone attack on Russian airbases, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," is sending a critical message to both Russia and Ukraine's Western allies. The operation, which reportedly took 18 months to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia and launching them remotely, resulting in significant damage to Russian aircraft. Beyond the physical damage, the attack aims to demonstrate Ukraine's continued resilience and commitment to the fight, despite concerns from some Western allies that Ukraine has already lost the war. The operation serves as a reminder to Russia and the Trump administration not to underestimate Kyiv's prospects.</p>

          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket win over West Indies in Cardiff, with Root becoming England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan's tally of 6,957 runs on the way to his highest ODI score, leading England's recovery from 93-4. He combined with Harry Brook for a third-wicket stand of 85, before a masterful partnership of 143 with Will Jacks put England within touching distance of victory. West Indies' 308 was set up by Keacy Carty's 103, bookended by half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope.</p>
