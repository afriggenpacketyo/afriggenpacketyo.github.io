          <p>Luke Charters, MP for York Outer, is calling for a reconsideration of the 1985 legislation that prohibits alcohol consumption in view of the pitch at English football matches. Charters argues for a 'modern approach' to the issue, highlighting the anomaly that supporters of other sports can enjoy alcoholic beverages during games. He suggests trialing the lifting of restrictions, similar to trials currently underway in the women's game, while acknowledging the need for family zones where alcohol consumption would remain inappropriate. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's call and welcomes trials in the men's game.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexican wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into artificial and restored wetlands, and the recaptured animals had gained weight, indicating successful hunting and predator avoidance. This success suggests that reintroducing captive-bred axolotls to restored wetlands is a viable strategy for conservation, potentially mitigating the impacts of habitat degradation and climate change. Axolotls are culturally significant in Mexico and hold value for medical research due to their regenerative abilities.</p>
