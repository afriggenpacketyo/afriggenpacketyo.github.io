        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a ¬£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The penalty includes ¬£104.5 million for sewage breaches and ¬£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for this reason. The company, serving a quarter of the UK's population, is under scrutiny for sewage discharges and faces a ¬£20 billion debt, though it recently secured ¬£3 billion in emergency funding to avoid collapse. The fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, as Thames Water addresses criticism and environmental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to ¬£1,000 each, and could have debts written off following a scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies are allocating over ¬£70 million in compensation and support after Ofgem's review found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Payments range from ¬£40 to ¬£1,000, depending on the circumstances, with additional debt write-offs for those affected. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent, as investigations continue for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

With a potential win, Pimblett believes he'll be one step closer to fighting for the belt. Pimblett and Topuria have a history of conflict, while Gaethje is known for his exciting fighting style and popularity among fans.</p>

          <p>Stellantis, the multinational automotive conglomerate, has appointed Antonio Filosa, previously the North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive. Filosa will succeed Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly in December, and will assume his new role effective June 23. With 25 years of experience at the company, Filosa has held various leadership positions, including Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. The appointment comes as Stellantis faces a 14% year-on-year decline in first-quarter net revenues and uncertainties related to U.S. trade policy, with John Elkann continuing as executive chairman.</p>

          <p>Antony's loan spell at Real Betis from Manchester United has been so impactful that the Spanish club's players are jokingly suggesting extreme measures to keep him. Captain Isco jokingly posted about kidnapping Antony, and former Betis winger Joaquin offered to provide the car for the hypothetical abduction. Since joining in late January, Antony has been instrumental in transforming Betis' season, helping them move from ninth to sixth in La Liga and secure a Europa League spot. He also played a crucial role in leading them to their first European final, where they will face Chelsea in the Conference League.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's Enzo Maresca is set to face his former mentor, Manuel Pellegrini, in the Uefa Conference League final, a matchup of master versus apprentice. Maresca credits Pellegrini with inspiring him to become a coach during their time together at Malaga, where Pellegrini guided the team to Champions League qualification. Despite their close relationship, both managers acknowledge that their familiarity with each other won't provide a significant advantage in the final. Maresca, who also worked under Pep Guardiola, learned valuable lessons from Pellegrini, including treating players like his own sons.</p>

Recent agreements, including over $200 billion in commercial deals, will see U.S. tech giants like OpenAI, Oracle, and Nvidia help build the Stargate UAE AI campus, providing the UAE with access to advanced chips and American technology.

          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to supply lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas in response to soaring rice prices. This move comes after the government suspended orders from major retailers to allocate rice to smaller shops, ensuring wider access to affordable rice. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi indicated the government would impose purchase limits for big retailers, with transport costs to be covered by the government. The government aims to ease the financial strain on households caused by retail rice prices doubling in the past year, hoping to stabilize supply and lower costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade that could significantly enhance the performance of both military and civilian aircraft. The new alloy turbine blade is designed to withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, improved fuel efficiency, and longer service life. Developed by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), this innovation reinforces China's position in high-performance propulsion technologies. The high-temperature alloy turbine blades are a critical component in modern jet engines, directly influencing thrust output, fuel efficiency, and reliability.</p>

          <p>A new Covid variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the U.S. following a surge in cases in China, though it is not yet included in federal variant-tracking dashboards due to limited U.S. data. While the WHO has designated it as a variant under monitoring, the public health risk is currently evaluated as low at the global level. Data suggests that NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible than previous variants, but does not lead to more severe illness. Experts anticipate that current Covid vaccines will remain effective against this variant, although the Trump administration is limiting access to vaccines for certain groups.</p>
