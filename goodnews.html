          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a new trade agreement, his first since implementing tariffs that initially destabilized markets. The agreement follows a period of trade discussions with various countries, including Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and India. These talks were initiated after Trump imposed tariffs on imported goods and reciprocal tariffs aimed at altering trading practices. The announcement comes ahead of a meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials to discuss trade issues.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that the ruling could cost the company "substantial sums." The court found Apple in contempt for violating an earlier order related to in-app purchase policies, ordering Apple to allow developers to link to external payment options. Apple argues that the changes will reduce consumer choice and harm its business. The judge in the case has also made a criminal referral, accusing Apple of misleading the court.</p>
