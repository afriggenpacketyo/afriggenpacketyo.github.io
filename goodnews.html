          <p>Chevron has won a critical arbitration case against its rival Exxon Mobil, resolving a dispute over valuable offshore oil assets in Guyana. The ruling by the International Chamber of Commerce affirms Chevron's right to proceed with its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation. Exxon had claimed a right of first refusal on Hess's 30% stake in the prolific Stabroek Block oil development. With the legal challenge overcome, the landmark deal is now expected to close, significantly expanding Chevron's portfolio with some of the world's most promising new oil discoveries.</p>

          <p>China's government has announced plans to boost its economy by stimulating domestic consumption within the service sector over the next five years. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao stated that Beijing will reduce restrictive measures and encourage foreign investment to improve the supply of high-quality services, particularly in areas like healthcare and elderly care. This strategic shift aims to make the economy more reliant on internal demand, providing a stable source of growth amid an uncertain global trade environment and ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <h2>Public Opinion on Immigration in the U.S. Shifts to a More Positive Stance Under Trump's Presidency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 07:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling data suggests that American public opinion on immigration is becoming more positive, a phenomenon political analysts describe as a "thermostatic" reaction to President Trump's hardline policies. After years of growing anti-immigrant sentiment, a record 79% of Americans now view immigration as a good thing for the country, according to Gallup. Support for aggressive enforcement measures has declined, while backing for legalization proposals has increased. This shift indicates that while Trump's rhetoric was popular in theory, the practical implementation of his agenda may be pushing public sentiment in the opposite direction.</p>

          <p>A bullwhip used by Harrison Ford in the 1989 film "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" has been sold for $525,000 at a Heritage Auctions event in Beverly Hills. The iconic prop was once gifted by Ford to the former Prince Charles and subsequently given to Princess Diana. The sale was part of a major entertainment auction that also saw the "Rosebud" sled from the classic film "Citizen Kane" fetch a near-record $14.75 million.

          <p>Shares of Swedish defense company Saab jumped significantly after it reported second-quarter operating income and sales that far exceeded analyst expectations. The company's operating income rose by 49% year-on-year, prompting it to raise its full-year sales growth forecast. This strong performance is largely attributed to a surge in European defense spending, as nations increase their security budgets in response to regional geopolitical tensions. Saab's CEO noted that the company has a strong portfolio to meet the high demand in the current defense market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial advisors are urging family offices, the private investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, to establish formal rules for hiring and managing family members. Without clear expectations, transparent salary policies, and objective performance metrics, these firms risk internal conflict, retention issues with non-family executives, and poor decision-making. Joshua Gentine, whose family founded Sargento Foods, advises creating structures like independent subcommittees to handle promotions and terminations. This professionalizes the environment and helps next-generation family members feel they have earned, rather than been given, their roles.</p>

          <p>This article previews the heavyweight championship rematch between undefeated champion Oleksandr Usyk and British challenger Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium. The focus is on what Dubois must do differently to secure a victory after his ninth-round loss in their first fight. Key to his strategy will be learning from the controversial fifth-round low blow, improving his ability to close distance, and managing the pressure of the big stage. Having rebuilt his confidence with three subsequent wins, Dubois aims to bring "chaos" and finally seize his moment to become the undisputed champion.</p>

          <p>The developer of the proposed Legends Tower in Oklahoma City says the project is fully financed and that construction on its first phase could begin later this year. The ambitious development includes a 1,907-foot skyscraper that would become the tallest in the United States. However, the project faces a significant hurdle as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined its planned height would be a "hazard to air navigation." The developer, Scot Matteson, states he is working with authorities to mitigate these concerns while hinting that the project could be expanded further.</p>

The clip has fueled widespread online speculation that the two were having an affair, turning a lighthearted concert moment into a source of intense public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A new Republican law establishes child savings accounts, dubbed "Trump accounts," which will provide a one-time $1,000 federal government deposit for newborns. While the initial bonus is attractive, tax experts warn that the rules are complicated. The accounts function similarly to a traditional IRA, meaning funds are generally locked until age 59½ without a 10% penalty, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. This structure makes them less flexible than other savings vehicles like 529 college savings plans, which offer more tax advantages and fewer restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>
