          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications have reached an agreement to merge, creating one of the largest deals in the cable industry and corporate America, valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. Charter CEO Chris Winfrey stated the merger would be "good for America," bringing jobs back from overseas and creating new customer service and sales careers. The deal comes amid slower-than-expected corporate deal activity, despite expectations of a looser regulatory environment following President Trump's election. The merger with Cox is expected to close simultaneously with Charter's acquisition of Liberty Broadband, with projected annualized cost synergies of $500 million within three years of closing. Relevant context: The merger is subject to regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Fujirebio's blood test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in certain patients, potentially making diagnosis easier and more accessible. The test measures two proteins in the blood associated with amyloid plaques in the brain, which are linked to Alzheimer's. It is intended for adults aged 55 and older presenting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline in specialized care settings. This approval follows years of sales of other blood tests for Alzheimer's without FDA approval, which the agency has sought to regulate more strictly.

          <p>A military parade to celebrate the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, could cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade in Washington D.C. is expected to feature 6,600 soldiers, 50 military aircraft, and 150 vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks. The army will place metal plates on the streets to protect the pavement from the tanks. The event has drawn criticism, with some calling it wasteful and self-aggrandizing. Relevant context: Trump previously scrapped a similar parade idea due to high costs and logistical issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the US considers lifting sanctions on Syria, Lebanon anticipates both risks and opportunities, with President Joseph Aoun focusing on regional trade, refugee returns, and economic recovery amid shifting alliances. The move could allow Syria to re-enter international markets and attract foreign investment, positively impacting Lebanon and the region. Lebanon, facing its own economic challenges and a large Syrian refugee population, hopes the easing of sanctions will facilitate the return of refugees and open land corridors for trade. Analysts suggest economic integration between Lebanon and Syria could outweigh competition. Relevant context: Lebanon continues to grapple with soaring inflation and regional instability.</p>
