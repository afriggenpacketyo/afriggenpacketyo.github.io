          <p>President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping by phone, focusing primarily on trade, according to both leaders. The call, initiated by Trump, aimed to address ongoing trade tensions between the two countries after constructive talks in Switzerland last month. The two countries had temporarily lowered tariffs on each other's goods following the talks, but the Trump administration has accused Beijing of slow-walking its pledge to approve the export of more critical minerals. China, in turn, has expressed frustration with new restrictions on Chinese student visas and warnings against using Chinese semiconductors. Optimism score is self-contained and does not influence the summary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman who claimed she experienced discrimination in job promotions. The court found that members of majority groups in protected classes do not need to meet a higher standard of evidence to establish discrimination. Marlean Ames, a heterosexual woman, argued she was discriminated against after being passed over for a promotion in favor of a lesbian woman and later replaced by a gay man. The ruling strikes down the Sixth Circuit Court's "background circumstances" rule, but the court notes that Ohio had "alternative arguments" for why the Ohio government's treatment of Ames was justified.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medications and supplements can expire, potentially becoming less effective or even harmful, so it's important to check expiration dates regularly. Pharmacist Stacia Woodcock advises against taking expired medication, as expiration dates ensure safety and efficacy. The FDA acknowledges that some properly stored medications may remain stable beyond their expiration date, but it is generally best to err on the side of caution. Proper storage in a cool, dry place like a kitchen cabinet or pantry, rather than a bathroom, can help prolong medication effectiveness, and medication take-back locations are the best way to dispose of expired or unwanted medications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed plans for the review but did not specify its scope or timeline, but experts say concerns about its safety are misguided. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000 after a comprehensive review determined it was safe and effective, and periodic reviews have not found new safety concerns. This review could potentially impact access to the medication, depending on whether the FDA strictly follows the science and its own safety reviews.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The autopen, a machine that automates a person's signature, has become a focus of political debate following allegations by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons. An autopen uses a pen or other writing instrument to replicate a person's signature on documents, and presidents have relied on them for routine correspondence and legislation. While Trump also used an autopen for unimportant papers, he criticized Biden's alleged use of the technology for signing pardons. The Justice Department concluded in 2005 that it was constitutional for a president to use an autopen to sign a bill.</p>

The current NATO target is 2% of GDP, but Trump has repeatedly claimed that allies do not spend enough compared to the U.S. The UK has pledged to increase its military spending to 2.5% by 2027 and to 3% in the next parliament.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that a Catholic charity in Wisconsin does not have to pay unemployment taxes, citing religious freedom guarantees. The Catholic Charities Bureau argued that the state violated the First Amendment by requiring the organization to pay the tax while exempting other faith groups. Wisconsin argued that the organization's day-to-day work doesn't involve religious teachings, but the court sided with the charity. The ruling comes amid several religious-rights cases the justices are considering this term, including public funding for religious schools and religious objections to books in schools.</p>
