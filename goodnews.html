          <p>South Korea's central bank, the Bank of Korea, held its policy rate steady at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, aligning with economist expectations. This decision aims to further assess housing market dynamics in Seoul and manage rising household debt, despite noting stable inflation and modest economic improvement. The BOK upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%. This economic context follows recent agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, which included multi-billion dollar investment pledges and reciprocal tariff reductions. Analysts from Bank of America suggest the BOK might consider rate cuts in the next three months, potentially in October, to maintain economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JD Property, the unlisted infrastructure investment and asset management platform of JD.com, is reportedly collaborating with Swiss investment firm Partners Group and EZA Hill Property to launch a US$1 billion Singapore Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). Anonymous sources suggest the REIT could be listed on the Singapore Exchange as early as next year, marking one of the largest new entrants in the sector in over a year. This initiative signals growing confidence in Singapore's REIT market and emphasizes the increasing influence of Chinese capital in Southeast Asian investments. The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million, which are expected to form part of the REIT's initial asset portfolio.

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of China's central bank, has called for a "multidimensional assessment" of stablecoins, urging caution amidst their global surge in popularity. He warned against their excessive use for asset speculation, which could trigger fraud and financial instability, and noted that some industry players prioritize cashing out over business sustainability. Zhou's comments, published by the China Finance 40 Forum, highlight Beijing's potential interest in yuan-backed stablecoins for currency internationalization, even as the US and Hong Kong advance their regulatory frameworks. The article emphasizes the need to evaluate stablecoins' genuine utility and systemic risks beyond a single perspective. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump honored Retired U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Verardo, a Purple Heart recipient and one of the most severely wounded veterans of the Afghanistan war, who died at age 40 from combat-related complications. Verardo's incredible resilience after stepping on an IED in 2010, enduring 120 surgeries, and his wife Sarah's unwavering dedication, led to the creation of the Independence Fund's Trackchair Initiative. This program, supported by Fox News viewers, has provided over 2,000 all-terrain wheelchairs to amputee veterans, significantly enhancing their quality of life and freedom. Trump praised Verardo as a "true American Hero" whose courage, sacrifice, and his family's selfless advocacy will serve as a lasting inspiration for the nation.</p>

          <p>A new NATO report reveals all member states are projected to meet the long-standing 2% of GDP defense spending target this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demands from U.S. President Donald Trump. However, only three nations—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently achieving the alliance's new, higher goal of 3.5%. While the U.S. contributes the most in absolute terms, its spending is at 3.22% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased defense spending by alliance members but emphasized the need to convert these funds into genuine military capability for effective deterrence, rather than just meeting numerical targets.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Reports Strong Earnings but Stock Dips on Data Center Revenue Miss</h2>

          <p>Nvidia announced stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, projecting over 50% sales growth this quarter, indicating sustained high demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite these positive financial results, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading due to its data center revenue falling marginally short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. Nvidia's finance chief, Colette Kress, highlighted the immense potential for AI infrastructure spending, estimating $3 to $4 trillion by the end of the decade. The article also touches upon the impact of geopolitical factors, noting that the H20 chip, designed for the Chinese market, could have significantly boosted second-quarter sales if not for export restrictions, underscoring the complexities of its global operations.

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, current president of the Board of Public Works, as the city's new film liaison, addressing a long-standing concern from industry advocates after a two-and-a-half-year delay. Kang, who will be assisted by Dan Halden and Amy Goldberg, is tasked with streamlining interactions between city bureaucracy and the film industry. This appointment is crucial as Los Angeles faces significant challenges, including a broader decline in film and TV production and the loss of jobs to states and countries offering more attractive tax incentives and filming conditions. The mayor's office hopes this move will protect the city's signature industry, improve local filming processes, and bolster small businesses reliant on the sector, signaling a renewed focus on its creative economy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated there's a "real possibility" of bringing the advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market, advocating for U.S. government support for American chipmakers to lead the AI race. Huang predicted a 50% growth in China's AI market next year, emphasizing its $50 billion opportunity. This follows his White House visits and a deal with President Trump for H20 chip export licenses, although official regulations for the U.S. government's 15% revenue cut are still pending. Nvidia would need to modify Blackwell chips to comply with export regulations, highlighting the delicate balance between market access and national security concerns in the global tech landscape.

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging eligible working parents in England to apply for 30 hours of government-funded childcare per week for children aged nine months to four years, as the final phase of the expansion plan begins in September. While the average cost of full-time nursery has decreased due to these initiatives, concerns persist about staffing and the availability of places, with some areas facing "childcare deserts." Although the government has increased hourly rates for providers, many still charge for extras, leading to nearly a quarter of parents being unable to afford the "free" hours. Charities warn of nurseries potentially withdrawing due to financial pressures, highlighting challenges in meeting demand and ensuring equitable access.</p>
