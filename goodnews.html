          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after six months of service. Fulcher stated the decision was his own and amicable, having planned to serve for that duration. During his tenure, he was involved in reviewing acquisition programs, streamlining software procurement, and redirecting funds toward military readiness. The Department of Defense expressed gratitude for his service, though his departure is part of a broader series of personnel changes within Hegseth's office since January.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals unaccounted for following the devastating floods on July 4. The count of missing persons has dropped from a peak of over 160 to just three after extensive verification efforts by local and state agencies confirmed many were safe. The update brings a measure of relief to the community, which suffered 107 fatalities in the county out of 134 statewide. Authorities expressed gratitude for the tireless work of over a thousand responders involved in the recovery and verification process.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass killings, even if they lack a specific ideological motive required for terrorism charges. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by cases like the Southport attack, where plotters could not be charged with a serious offense pre-emptively. This new power would allow police to intervene and apprehend suspects based on preparatory actions, such as researching a target, mirroring the powers available in counter-terrorism law. The move is part of a broader effort to adapt the justice system to evolving threats.</p>

          <p>The traditional six-week summer holiday for UK schools is facing renewed debate, with some advocating for shorter breaks to ease parental childcare burdens and prevent learning loss. Proponents argue it could also address 'holiday hunger' for children on free school meals, while spreading holidays throughout the year might lower travel costs. However, opponents, including many teachers, stress the need for a long break to recharge and plan. The issue is divisive, as shown by a recent Welsh consultation, and involves complex factors like family finances, student well-being, and changing climate patterns.</p>

          <p>The UK's chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is aiming to shift the nation's financial habits from risk-averse saving to investing in stocks and shares to boost the economy. The government plans to send targeted messages to people with money in low-interest accounts and may launch a new ad campaign, but has paused on a controversial idea to cut the cash ISA allowance. Experts note a significant gender gap in investing and warn that a clumsy approach could backfire, especially in uncertain markets. The debate highlights the challenge of changing public attitudes towards financial risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The new spaces emphasize personal accomplishment over family pedigree and provide a venue for networking, collaboration, and socializing. While their membership policies are more progressive, they remain exclusive and expensive, reflecting the rise of a new, self-made elite in India's booming economy.</p>
