          <p>Indiana Fever player Sophie Cunningham has embraced her reputation as a "feisty" and competitive player, particularly after gaining fame for defending teammate Caitlin Clark during on-court altercations. In a team-produced video, Cunningham described herself as bringing energy and sass, stating she is the "ultimate competitor." Her popularity surged following a June game where she was ejected after a physical confrontation that began after Clark was targeted by opposing players. This newfound role as Clark's 'enforcer' has been widely discussed by fans, who have also noted her background as a taekwondo black belt and a former high school football kicker.</p>

          <p>China is strategically focusing on developing what it terms "future industries" to drive a new model of economic growth based on technological innovation and industrial upgrades. First introduced by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this concept targets sectors with nascent technologies that are expected to have enormous future potential. In 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology expanded this focus to include humanoid robots, 6G network equipment, and brain-computer interfaces. This initiative is a core part of China's plan to secure a leading position in the global technology race by cultivating groundbreaking industrial capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Lab-Grown Cheese Nears Market Launch Amid Consumer and Industry Skepticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 20:12:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-up companies like Better Dairy in London are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. These firms aim to launch their products in the coming years, targeting consumers looking for alternatives that more closely mimic the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese than current plant-based options. However, they face significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval processes, and a recent decline in sales for plant-based cheeses. The success of this emerging industry will depend on overcoming consumer concerns about taste, price, and the ultra-processed nature of such foods.</p>

          <p>A Norfolk woman, Jess Basey-Fisher, has fulfilled her goal of finding the older brother she never knew she had, after her father revealed a long-held family secret. Following her mother's death, Jess learned that her mother had given up a baby boy for adoption years before meeting her father. Using the few details she had, Jess tracked down her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, who was living in Australia and had been raised by adoptive parents who were, coincidentally, also a doctor and a nurse. Their emotional reunion was made more urgent when Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to support him.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers prospect Josue De Paula earned the Most Valuable Player award at the All-Star Futures Game after hitting a decisive three-run homerun. The 20-year-old outfielder's 416-foot blast secured a 4-2 victory for the National League team in a showcase of baseball's top minor league talent. De Paula, who is considered the number one prospect in the Dodgers' farm system, expressed that the moment was highly motivating and emotionally significant, especially performing in front of his father. Despite his rising star status, he remains focused on his development amid the usual trade deadline speculation, hoping to remain with the Dodgers long-term.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show Love Island is experiencing a revival in viewership, with figures approaching levels not seen since its popular 2022 season. This resurgence is being driven significantly by social media, particularly TikTok, where the show's official accounts have gained over a million new followers in 2025. Content creators and former contestants note that many viewers now prefer to keep up with the show through short-form video clips, recaps, and online discourse rather than watching the full hour-long nightly episodes. While this strategy broadens the show's reach, some critics worry it distorts the reality of the show by presenting conversations and events out of context.</p>

His dominant start, featuring fastballs reaching nearly 100 mph, set a positive tone for the team. While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan was credited with the win, Ohtani's efficient outing was crucial in providing the momentum the struggling Dodgers needed to secure a much-anticipated victory.</p>

          <p>A last-minute try by Jack van Poortvliet gave England a dramatic 22-17 victory over Argentina, securing an impressive 2-0 series win in San Juan. With the score tied for most of the second half, a late break by Guy Pepper set up the replacement scrum-half for the decisive score in the final moments of the match. The victory marks England's sixth consecutive Test win and is a significant achievement for a squad missing numerous key players. Tries from Seb Atkinson and Freddie Steward in the first half established England's presence, as they overcame a resilient Pumas side to clinch the series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has dismissed all charges against a Utah plastic surgeon who was accused of destroying COVID-19 vaccine doses and providing fake vaccination cards. Dr. Michael Kirk Moore had been indicted under the Biden administration for allegedly throwing away government-provided vaccines and giving children saline shots at their parents' request. On Saturday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the charges were dropped at her direction, stating in a social media post that Dr. Moore "gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so." The motion to dismiss cited that doing so was "in the interests of justice."</p>

          <p>As China grapples with a declining population and falling birth rates, some experts are exploring the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping societal norms around family and elder care. The article profiles a young professional in Beijing who, like a growing number of Chinese women, does not see marriage and childbearing as essential and believes AI will eventually fulfill needs for companionship and caregiving. While AI is often blamed for exacerbating population decline by replacing human roles, one demography expert argues this technological shift may not be entirely negative. They suggest that AI could redefine traditional concepts of life and family, potentially making demographic concerns obsolete.</p>
