          <p>This article argues that despite perceptions of stagnation, China is undergoing a profound economic restructuring, significantly driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs and consumers. Unlike previous cohorts, these business leaders, largely born after the 1950s, are technically trained and focused on innovation and co-creation. Many hail from provinces known for strong business cultures and blend their experiences of past scarcity with market opportunities and technological advancements. Their increasing integration into global systems and focus on competitiveness at scale are key to China's continued economic resilience and transformation.</p>

          <p>War Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered a stark message to military leaders, demanding they prioritize physical fitness, align with the Trump administration's agenda, or resign. This address, which was televised, emphasized a return to a warfighting ethos, gender-neutral combat fitness tests, and daily physical training for all ranks, including senior officers. The speech was seen by many as an anti-woke directive, aiming to restore uniformity and shift decision-making to the warfighter. While unusual, the message was clear: compliance with new policies and culture is expected, with consequences for non-adherence.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has achieved a new club record, going 19 games unbeaten across all competitions, including winning the FA Cup and securing a first away victory in Europe. Under manager Oliver Glasner, the "hungry" and "ambitious" Eagles are currently third in the Premier League, maintaining the only unbeaten record with three wins and three draws. This remarkable turnaround follows a challenging period last season, showcasing a significant improvement in performance and tactical prowess.

          <p>A team of divers from 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC has discovered an estimated $1 million in silver and gold coins off Florida's "treasure coast." The more than 1,000 coins, believed to be minted in Spanish colonies, were part of a fleet wrecked by a hurricane on July 31, 1715, while being transported back to Spain. The salvage company highlighted the historical significance of the find, noting that visible dates and mint marks offer valuable insights for historians and collectors. This discovery is celebrated not only for its monetary value but also for the stories it tells, linking back to the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

          <p>CBS Miami entertainment reporter Lisa Petrillo has publicly shared her 10-month private battle with early-stage breast cancer during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Her diagnosis, caught at Stage One, was a result of her persistence in requesting an examination of her right breast after a self-check, despite doctors initially focusing on her left. Petrillo underwent a lumpectomy and radiation, and is now in remission, taking medication for five years. She hopes her story inspires others to prioritize self-exams and early detection, with CBS Miami partnering with organizations to offer free mammogram screenings to increase accessibility.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Lucumí: Afro-Caribbean Spirituality as a Path to Survival and Well-being</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-02 17:01:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores Lucumí, also known as Santería, an Afro-Caribbean spirituality rooted in Yoruba cosmology, highlighting its role as a practice of survival and well-being for enslaved Africans in Cuba. The tradition emphasizes character, balance, and connection to divine orishas, evolving as a form of resistance against forced conversion to Catholicism. Scholars are working to demystify Lucumí, often mislabeled as "witchcraft" due to anti-Black beliefs, and to correct misconceptions about practices like animal sacrifice, which are prayerful and communal. Ultimately, Lucumí is presented as a profound system for holistic health, honoring nature and ancestors, in defiance of white supremacy.</p>

          <p>Fair Isaac, the creator of the widely used FICO score, saw its shares surge over 20% after announcing a new pricing model allowing mortgage lenders to directly license credit scores, bypassing credit bureaus. This change aims to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and give lenders more choice in distribution. The announcement caused shares of credit bureaus like Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax to fall, as the move could lessen their intermediary role. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte praised FICO's initiative as a "Creative Solution" to foster safer, stronger, and more competitive markets for American consumers.

          <p>Intel's stock has surged over 50% in the last month, pushing its shares past $37 and increasing the U.S. government's 10% stake to approximately $16 billion. The Trump administration's $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock was funded by grants from the previous CHIPS and Science Act. This rally, along with significant investments from Softbank and Nvidia, signals a rebound for the troubled chipmaker after its worst year on record in 2024. CEO Lip Bu-Tan credits President Trump's focus on U.S. chip manufacturing for driving these historic investments, restoring confidence and pushing shares to their highest level in 18 months.
