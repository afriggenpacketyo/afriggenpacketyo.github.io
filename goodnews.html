          <p>A minor ground collision occurred at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport when a United Airlines plane clipped the tail of another stationary United aircraft while taxiing to its gate. No injuries were reported among the 113 passengers on the arriving flight from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, who deplaned normally after a delay. The incident involved the plane's wing striking the horizontal stabilizer of the other aircraft. This event adds to recent concerns about aviation safety following several other runway incidents and near misses across the United States, although many passengers on this flight were initially unaware a collision had even happened.</p>

          <p>Efforts are underway to restore the main external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has relied on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, announced that a "complex repair plan" is proceeding after Russian and Ukrainian forces established special ceasefire zones to ensure the safety of the repair crews. The plant, which is Europe's largest and currently under Russian control, needs a reliable power source to cool its six shutdown reactors and prevent a potential nuclear incident. Ukrainian officials noted this is the 42nd time power lines to the plant have required restoration since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>Job seekers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence to create professional headshots for platforms like LinkedIn, seeking an affordable alternative to costly photography sessions. AI tools from companies like Canva and HeadshotPro allow users to generate polished profile pictures for under $50 by uploading selfies, which some users claim has led to a significant increase in recruiter engagement. However, the trend raises concerns about authenticity among HR professionals, who value genuine representation and can be put off by overly stylized or fake-looking images. Despite the risks, the accessibility and cost-effectiveness of AI headshots are making them a popular choice in the current competitive labor market.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days. To ensure cultural and religious authenticity, organizers shipped 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament, deeply rooted in Shinto tradition, aims to introduce the highly ritualized sport to a Western audience, complete with in-ear English commentary to explain its complex rules and techniques.</p>

          <p>In response to rising suicide rates and mental health challenges among Black men, community-led support groups are creating safe spaces for vulnerability and healing. Organizations like Mental Health Is Real Wealth in Los Angeles provide a forum for Black men to discuss pressures related to systemic racism, economic disparities, and societal expectations of masculinity without judgment. These groups serve as a crucial gateway to therapy, as Black men are less likely to seek professional mental health support and often face culturally incompetent care when they do. The initiative aims to break generational cycles and foster emotional expression in a demographic disproportionately affected by stress and trauma.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who graduated debt-free after winning 30 scholarships, advises prospective college students to avoid common application mistakes to maximize their chances of securing financial aid. She identifies the biggest errors as applying only for highly competitive national scholarships, not applying to enough opportunities, and failing to effectively market oneself in essays. Greene recommends focusing on local, state-level, and "intersectionality" scholarships with narrower criteria to reduce the applicant pool. She suggests that students should treat the process like a numbers game, applying for 100 to 200 scholarships to significantly increase their odds of success in funding their education.</p>

Twenge also stresses the importance of setting firm rules once devices are introduced, such as using basic phones without internet first, implementing parental controls for time limits, and banning phones from bedrooms overnight.

He argues that currency-based investments are a bet on government stability and typically decline in value over time. Buffett describes gold as an asset that produces nothing, with its value relying solely on the hope that someone else will pay more for it in the future due to fear. He strongly favors the third category—productive assets that deliver tangible returns, like crops from a farm or profits from a company—as the basis for rational, long-term wealth creation.

Their political views are shaped by coming of age amidst economic instability, climate change, and threats to reproductive rights, leading them to see radical change as a necessity for self-defense rather than a choice. This leftist identification reflects a deep disillusionment with the existing political duopoly and a desire for systemic solutions to pressing social and economic issues.</p>

          <p>A growing number of wealthy Americans are investing in British soccer teams, with over half of the 92 clubs in England and Wales' top four leagues now having some form of U.S. ownership. Investors are attracted by the relatively affordable entry price compared to major American sports franchises and the global appeal of leagues like the Premier League. This trend, which includes high-profile celebrity investors like Ryan Reynolds and Tom Brady, is bringing a more commercial approach to the clubs and boosting investment in women's soccer. The increasing popularity of soccer in the U.S., further fueled by shows like "Ted Lasso," is helping to drive this transatlantic sports-business connection.</p>
