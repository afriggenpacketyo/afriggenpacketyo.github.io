          <p>U2 is officially back in the studio after an eight-year break, spurred by drummer Larry Mullen Jr.'s recovery from neck surgery. The band, speaking at the Ivor Novello Awards where they received a fellowship, expressed excitement about their renewed chemistry and the opportunity to create something original. Bono emphasized their focus on the future sound, noting that the simplicity of bass, drums, guitar, and vocals feels like a fresh idea in 2025. The band has spent recent years reflecting on their past, but they are now eager to explore new sonic territories and push the boundaries of their music.</p>

          <p>Nicole Brown, a police officer in Orange County, California, has been charged with 15 felonies related to workers' compensation insurance fraud.

Extreme weather events in China serve as a reminder of the escalating impact of climate change, making decisive action an act of national resilience.</p>
