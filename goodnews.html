          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans on Capitol Hill to advocate for the passage of his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which recently passed a House committee vote. Trump urged lawmakers not to let SALT deductions impede the bill's progress, highlighting the importance of unity in achieving legislative goals. Concurrently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the Senate Appropriations Committee, while Trump announced an upcoming announcement with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

          <p>The Washington D.C. home of U.S. Navy Secretary John Phelan sustained damage in a fire, according to U.S. officials. Phelan and his wife were preparing to move into the Kalorama mansion, which they purchased last month, but the residence was unoccupied during renovations. Firefighters responded to the scene, and a Navy spokesperson confirmed that the family was not home when the fire broke out. Preliminary investigations suggest the blaze was caused by an electrical event, and authorities are assessing the extent of the damage to the three-story mansion.</p>

          <p>A new study utilizing machine learning challenges the theory that dark streaks on Mars are caused by flowing water. Researchers analyzed over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images, creating a global Martian map of slope streaks and recurring slope lineae (RSLs). The analysis found that these features are more likely associated with wind speeds and dust deposition rather than liquid or frost. The study suggests a dry origin for the streaks, potentially caused by shockwaves from recent-impact craters or rockfalls, casting doubt on the habitability of these regions.</p>

          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, the Northern Jaguar Project uses motion-sensing cameras and a program called Viviendo con Felinos to protect jaguars by compensating ranchers for photos of wild cats on their land. This initiative aims to change the perception of jaguars from threats to valuable ecosystem members. The program has expanded the protected area and fostered a shift in cultural attitudes among ranchers, promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife. The success of these efforts bodes well for the potential reestablishment of jaguars in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned House Republicans against cutting Medicaid during a closed-door meeting, as they debated a major tax bill. A faction of Republicans sought to include Medicaid cuts and work requirements in the legislation, facing opposition from critics who argue such measures would create bureaucratic challenges. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million Americans. This warning underscores the divisions within the Republican party regarding healthcare policy and budget priorities.</p>
