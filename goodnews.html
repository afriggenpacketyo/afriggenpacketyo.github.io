          <p>Bruno Fernandes celebrated his 200th game for Manchester United by scoring his 100th goal for the club, leading his team to a 2-1 victory against Chelsea. His performance was highlighted not just by the goal but by his passionate and energetic display, which manager Ruben Amorim praised as a crucial influence on the squad. Despite some criticism of his temperament and defensive discipline in a new, deeper midfield role, Fernandes's commitment was on full display. Amorim stated that the captain deserves a significant place in the club's history for his contributions and dedication since joining in 2020.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force (RAF) has conducted its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. Two RAF Typhoon jets, supported by a refueling aircraft, patrolled the skies to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank. The mission, named 'Eastern Sentry,' was initiated after Poland reported 19 Russian drone incursions on a single day, an event that significantly escalated regional tensions. UK Defence Secretary John Healey stated the operation sends a clear signal that NATO airspace will be defended against what he described as reckless Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Approximately 6,000 residents in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay neighborhood were evacuated overnight after a 1,000-pound, U.S.-made World War II bomb was discovered at a construction site. Bomb disposal experts worked for nearly ten hours to defuse the device, which contained 500 pounds of TNT. Police officials described the operation as having exceptionally high risks but confirmed it was completed successfully with no injuries. This is not the first such discovery in the city, as Hong Kong was the target of U.S. air raids during the Japanese occupation in WWII, leaving behind unexploded ordnance.</p>

          <p>An armed man was arrested outside State Farm Stadium in Arizona, the venue for a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, identified as Joshua Runkles, was reportedly exhibiting suspicious behavior and, when approached by Secret Service agents, claimed to be an armed law enforcement officer. Authorities confirmed he was not an officer and was carrying a weapon into a prohibited place. The memorial for Kirk, who was killed on September 10, is a high-security event, designated a Level 1 Special Event Assessment Rating, with President Trump and other senior officials scheduled to attend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have adopted a new strategy of openly embracing patriotic symbols, such as the Union Jack and England flags, at their party conference in Bournemouth. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a passionate speech, draping himself in a flag and urging members to "reclaim patriotism" from the divisive forces of nationalism. This move marks a significant shift for the party, which has traditionally avoided such displays. The strategy aims to position the Lib Dems as the true patriots in contrast to what they term the "plastic patriotism" of figures like Reform UK's Nigel Farage.</p>

          <p>Sonny Curtis, a pioneering rock 'n' roll musician and prolific songwriter, has passed away. Curtis began his career as a bandmate of Buddy Holly and later joined The Crickets after Holly's death. He penned numerous iconic songs, including the rebellious anthem "I Fought the Law," famously covered by The Clash, and the Everly Brothers' hit "Walk Right Back." However, he is perhaps most widely known for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the optimistic theme song for the classic 1970s sitcom "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," which cemented his place in television history.</p>

          <h2>Social Psychologist Identifies Disrespect as a Key Red Flag in Romantic Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 14:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a major red flag in a relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book "Love by Design," she explains that disrespect can manifest in subtle ways, like one partner consistently walking ahead of the other, or in more significant ways, such as devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that people enter relationships to be seen and valued. She advises addressing these behaviors through direct conversation, noting that while some partners can learn and change, others may not.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reportedly used its newly acquired "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant. The company had notified nearly 800 workers of an impending closure, but reversed its decision after Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened. These veto powers over strategic decisions like plant closures were a condition of the national-security agreement that allowed Japan's Nippon to acquire U.S. Steel in June. This marks the first time the administration has exercised this authority, highlighting its increasing role in corporate operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, relocated to Japan's Chiba Prefecture to teach English and found a significantly lower cost of living.
