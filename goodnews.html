          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced plans to expand the company's robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, with a Bay Area launch pending regulatory approval. Musk also stated that xAI's chatbot, Grok, will be integrated into Tesla vehicles within the week, following a recent update to the AI model. These developments occur amidst a challenging period for Musk, who faces investor concerns over his public disputes with the Trump administration and a recent decline in Tesla's stock value. The announcement comes as xAI addresses controversy over antisemitic content generated by its chatbot.</p>

          <p>North Carolina has reclaimed the top spot in CNBC's 2025 "America's Top States for Business" ranking, praised for its robust economy, skilled workforce, and business-friendly environment. The state has successfully attracted major investments, including from companies like JetZero and Amazon, contributing to significant job growth and a high rate of in-migration for college-educated workers. Despite its economic strengths and bipartisan support for business, the state faces challenges, including a low ranking for quality of life and potential economic headwinds from federal policy changes and hurricane recovery costs. Governor Josh Stein has emphasized a cautious approach to fiscal policy amidst these uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In post-war Syria, firefighters from the former Assad regime are being integrated with the internationally recognized White Helmets, who now lead the country's emergency services. This article from a Damascus firehouse details the deep-seated mistrust and tension between the two groups, who were once on opposite sides of the civil war and are now forced to work together. Despite physical and psychological barriers, including different pay scales and separate living quarters, the firefighters are slowly bridging divides through shared work and personal stories of trauma. The challenging process of unification at this firehouse reflects the broader societal effort to reconcile and rebuild Syria after years of conflict.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its stock jump 13% after reinstating its 2025 profit forecast and signaling a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. The airline now anticipates full-year earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share, a downward revision from its initial January forecast but a sign of stabilization after a period of demand uncertainty. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while corporate travel has not grown as expected, booking patterns have steadied, and strong sales of premium seats and its American Express partnership have bolstered revenue. The positive outlook from Delta also provided a lift to the stocks of other major U.S. carriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round, bringing its total capital to $329 million. The company's mission is to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space to crystallize drugs that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of its space missions and expand its laboratory capabilities to handle more complex molecules. Having already completed three launches and with a fourth currently in orbit, Varda is pioneering in-space manufacturing beyond the International Space Station, aiming to meet rigorous industry turnaround times.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the country's only operational rare earth mine, through a $400 million investment. This public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earth elements, which are critical for military technologies like F-35 fighter jets and drones, and reduce America's heavy reliance on China. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing capacity and the construction of a new magnet manufacturing facility. This move is a significant step in the U.S. government's strategy to secure domestic sources of critical minerals for national and economic security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Ferrero Group, known for Nutella and Rocher chocolates, has announced its intention to purchase WK Kellogg Co. for approximately $3.1 billion. The acquisition includes Kellogg's portfolio of iconic cereal brands like Corn Flakes and Froot Loops in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. This move represents a significant expansion for the Italian food giant in the North American market, following its previous acquisitions of Nestlé's U.S. candy brands and Wells Enterprises ice cream. For WK Kellogg, which spun off from its snack business in 2023, the deal provides greater resources to grow its brands in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own hardware solution to cool the next generation of power-hungry Nvidia GPUs used for artificial intelligence. Faced with the challenge that existing cooling solutions were inadequate for their scale, AWS developed the "In-Row Heat Exchanger" (IRHX) to manage the heat produced by Nvidia's new Blackwell chips. This custom hardware allows AWS to efficiently deploy the high-density computing systems in its data centers, making the advanced AI clusters available to its cloud customers. The move reflects Amazon's strategy of developing in-house hardware to optimize performance and reduce reliance on third-party suppliers.</p>

The suspects, three males and one female aged 17 to 20, were arrested on suspicion of blackmail, money laundering, and other computer misuse offenses. The hacks caused significant disruption, leaving some Co-op shelves empty and costing M&S an estimated £300 million in lost profits after criminals stole vast amounts of customer and staff data and deployed ransomware. The arrests mark a significant development in the investigation into the attacks that have severely impacted two of Britain's major retailers.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's government is escalating its efforts to reduce harmful alcohol consumption by approving a plan to raise taxes on alcohol from the current 65% to 90% by 2031. The move is driven by public health concerns, as alcohol is a leading cause of death in the country, and aims to support a zero-tolerance drink-driving policy. This tax hike is also part of a broader strategy to fund the country's ambitious goal of providing universal health insurance coverage as its population ages. The alcohol industry has opposed the measure, warning of a negative impact on sales, which have already been declining in recent years.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after being trapped in a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a 7-mile-long wastewater tunnel being constructed as part of the Los Angeles County Sanitation District's Clearwater Project. After the initial collapse trapped 27 workers, four of their colleagues went in to help before becoming trapped themselves. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed a massive response, including its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and confirmed that none of the rescued workers sustained any visible injuries.

          <p>The Atlantic tropics are currently quiet, with the National Hurricane Center not expecting any storm formation in the next seven days, largely due to Saharan dust and wind shear. However, AccuWeather forecasters are monitoring the northeastern Gulf of Mexico and the waters off the U.S. Southeast coast for potential "homegrown" tropical development between July 15-18. A cold front moving into the area could generate some spin, similar to the setup that formed a previous tropical storm. While the risk is low, and any resulting system would likely be weak, it serves as a reminder that the hurricane season is active.</p>
