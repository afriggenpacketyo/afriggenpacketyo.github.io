          <p>U.S. Steel shares ceased trading on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel. The deal, finalized after initial opposition from former President Biden, was approved under President Trump, who touted a "partnership" between the companies. Nippon Steel has agreed to make substantial investments in U.S. Steel, including an $11 billion commitment by 2028 and the steel will continue to be "mined, melted, and made" in the United States. The agreement includes a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government, ensuring U.S. Steel remains a U.S.-incorporated entity and that the majority of its board members are U.S. citizens.

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo's lead in the New York City mayoral primary is narrowing, according to a recent poll.

          <p>The article explores why straight men are often considered bad at gossiping, challenging the assumption that they don't engage in it. Research suggests that men and women gossip at similar rates, but women tend to gossip neutrally more often, giving them more practice. Men's perceived lack of skill may stem from cultural norms that discourage them from openly participating in or enjoying gossip. The piece examines the social implications of gossip and its potential to foster intimacy, suggesting that men's reticence may contribute to the male loneliness epidemic.

          <p>The article discusses the shift in fitness trends from "muscle mommies" to "Pilates princesses," noting the return of the 'thin is in' mentality. This shift is fueled by the rise of weight-loss shots like Ozempic and fitness influencers promoting "leanness" through Pilates. The author argues that this narrows the idea of what a "fit" body should look like, potentially causing people to develop an obsessive approach to exercise. The piece emphasizes the importance of celebrating all forms of movement and focusing on well-being over purely aesthetic goals. The optimism score is 60.</p>
