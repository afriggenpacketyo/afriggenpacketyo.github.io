          <p>The Quad nations‚ÄîUS, Japan, India, and Australia‚Äîhave launched a new initiative to secure stable supply chains for critical minerals essential for modern technology. This move is widely seen as a strategic effort to reduce dependence on China, which currently dominates the mineral processing market. The joint statement highlighted concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions, emphasizing the need for diversification. The initiative also involves collaboration with around 30 to 40 companies from the Quad countries to strengthen the strategic stability of the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic shift for the company's contract chip manufacturing, or foundry, business. The potential change involves deprioritizing the "18A" manufacturing process, a key initiative under the previous CEO, for external customers due to its waning appeal and production delays. Instead, the company may focus more resources on the next-generation "14A" process, where it hopes to gain a competitive edge over rivals like TSMC. This move aims to attract major clients such as Apple and Nvidia and represents a major pivot to revive the U.S. chipmaker's fortunes.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. The proposal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would provide a window to work towards a permanent end to the war. This development comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The conflict, which began after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and it remains unclear if Hamas will agree to the terms.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has enacted the nation's toughest law restricting PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," found in many consumer products and linked to serious health issues. The legislation is named "Amara's Law" after Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers in 2023 while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. 3M, the company that developed the chemicals, has agreed to stop producing them and pay $850 million for cleanup, marking a major victory for public health and environmental advocates.</p>

He emphasized the importance of using his platform to inspire the next generation, finding joy in the game away from the high-pressure professional environment.

Surgeons are using specially designed magnetic extractors to safely and quickly remove metal fragments from critical areas like the heart and lungs with minimal invasion. The modernised technology, developed by a volunteer team in response to needs from front-line medics, allows for more precise and less dangerous operations. This ingenuity in the face of the brutal realities of drone warfare has been praised by war medics as a potential game-changer for battlefield medicine.</p>

Nvidia overcame concerns about competition and U.S. government restrictions due to persistent, strong demand for its unrivaled AI chips. Cramer attributed Meta's success to its powerful advertising capabilities, which helped its stock recover from an earlier decline and blow past earnings estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

The Bank is seeking themes that represent the UK's national identity and are enduring without being divisive.

The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, and the resulting goal advanced the team, securing an extra ¬£10 million in prize money, more than covering his early signing fee. While questions remain about his defensive adjustment to a new system under coach Xabi Alonso, his attacking prowess is already making an impact.
