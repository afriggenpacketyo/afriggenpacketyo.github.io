          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has publicly addressed Berkshire Hathaway's decision to sell its entire remaining stake, describing the move as a normal part of investing. BYD executives expressed gratitude for Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's 17 years of support, even as the company's stock fell over 6% following the news. This divestment from China contrasts with Berkshire's increasing investment in Japanese trading houses, with its stake in Mitsui now exceeding 10%. The article notes that BYD has recently faced challenges, including cutting its 2025 sales target and reporting its first quarterly profit decline in three years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. The change comes after a poor start to the season left the club in 19th place in the Premier League table. Nuno, who was recently sacked by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to their highest league finish in decades last season, is tasked with improving the team's competitive standing. The appointment has been seen by some as a return to a more pragmatic, counter-attacking style, similar to that of former manager David Moyes.</p>

After retiring from the Air Force in 1971, he became a dedicated advocate for the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.

          <p>Activist investor Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, arguing the timing is opportune for a transaction. This follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which led the company to divest its international assets and become a U.S. pure-play advertising business. Despite these strategic moves, Clear Channel's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale is the best path forward for shareholders. The company is now seen as a more attractive acquisition target for peers like Lamar Advertising or private equity, given its focused operations and the slow pace of its valuable digital billboard conversion.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the nationwide housing affordability crisis by manufacturing homes in a factory setting. The company claims its process can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional on-site building. Fading West recently demonstrated its rapid-response capabilities by producing 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires, a project coordinated with FEMA. By applying manufacturing principles to housing, the company aims to make home ownership more attainable for essential workers and others priced out of the current market.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and writer known for his unconventional television interviews with cultural icons, has died at the age of 103. An Austrian Jew who fled the Nazis, he later returned to Europe as a US soldier and served as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. Troller became a prominent correspondent in Paris, where his show "Personenbeschreibung" (Describing People) featured insightful interviews with figures like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. His work was lauded for its sensitive and critical approach, which he described as a form of "healing through other people" after his own traumatic experiences.</p>

          <p>Major dating apps, including Bumble and those under Match Group, are increasingly incorporating AI to function as "emotionally intelligent matchmakers" in an effort to combat user swipe fatigue. The new approach aims to move beyond superficial profiles by using AI to analyze user values, goals, and beliefs to suggest more compatible partners. However, experts are skeptical, pointing out that romantic chemistry remains largely unpredictable and that past attempts by sites like OkCupid showed that the suggestion of compatibility was more powerful than actual algorithmic matching. While AI may refine the process, the fundamental mystery of human connection remains a challenge for any technology to solve.</p>

          <p>When six-year-old Imani Dell's eyes suddenly became crossed, her mother initially suspected it was from too much tablet time. However, when Imani began seeing double, a trip to the emergency room revealed a golf-ball sized medulloblastoma, a fast-growing brain tumor. Neurosurgeons at Holtz Children's Hospital in Miami successfully removed the tumor, and Imani subsequently endured 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year. After finishing her treatment in August, Imani has returned to school, and her family is celebrating her recovery and return to a normal childhood.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a rise in serious runway incursions, aerospace company Honeywell is developing and testing a new cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A). The technology is designed to give pilots more advance warning of potential collisions on the ground, a critical phase of flight where seconds count. During a test flight, the system successfully alerted pilots to another aircraft on the runway, allowing them to safely abort a landing. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and some airlines like Southwest and Alaska have embraced such systems to add another layer of protection and mitigate the risk of airport disasters.</p>

          <p>An opinion article revisits the landmark 1977 case involving a neo-Nazi group's plan to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors. The author reflects on the painful yet crucial First Amendment questions it raised about protecting offensive and hateful speech. The piece quotes David Goldberger, the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to march, who acknowledged the pain it caused but stands by the principle that free speech cannot be denied simply because it is offensive. The author suggests this historical precedent offers a unifying thought for today's divided times: "Free speech doesn't work just when you agree with it."</p>

          <p>Broadcast media giants Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their ABC affiliate stations. The companies had pulled the program after host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move encouraged by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr. However, the boycott proved more costly for the local stations, which lost significant viewership by replacing the popular late-night show with local programming. The standoff highlighted the shifting power dynamics between networks and large affiliate owners, but ultimately demonstrated that the network's valuable content gives it the upper hand in such disputes.</p>

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the unsafe recycling of lead-acid batteries. In many low- and middle-income countries, used car and backup power batteries are processed in informal, unregulated operations where acid is dumped and lead is melted down, releasing toxic dust into communities. This public health crisis, which drains trillions from the global economy, is solvable through policy changes. Countries like Brazil have successfully formalized the industry by altering tax incentives and implementing "extended producer responsibility" laws that require manufacturers to manage the collection and safe recycling of their products.</p>
