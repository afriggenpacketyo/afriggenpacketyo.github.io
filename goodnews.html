          <p>Lee Jae-myung, leader of South Korea's opposition party, has been elected president following the impeachment and removal of former leader Yoon Suk Yeol due to his controversial martial law imposition. Lee secured 49.42% of the vote, surpassing conservative candidate Kim Moon Soo's 41.15%. He will be immediately sworn in, foregoing the typical transition period, and will serve a five-year term, influencing trade negotiations with the U.S. and policies toward China and North Korea, while the Kospi index saw a surge and the South Korean won strengthened modestly. The article contextualizes Lee's victory within the political turmoil caused by Yoon's impeachment and highlights the challenges Lee faces in reviving South Korea's economy and negotiating trade agreements with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's economy experienced slower-than-expected growth in the first quarter of 2025, with a year-on-year increase of 1.3%, unchanged from the previous quarter and below Reuters' estimated 1.5%. Quarter-on-quarter growth was 0.2%, also missing expectations of 0.4%. The Australian Bureau of Statistics attributed the soft growth to reduced public spending, weakened consumer demand, and decreased exports, further exacerbated by extreme weather events impacting mining, tourism, and shipping. The Reserve Bank of Australia had previously cut rates to a two-year low in May, anticipating a gradual pickup in GDP growth driven by consumption recovery and public demand.</p>

          <p>Despite CrowdStrike reporting strong quarterly results, including revenue growth and adjusted EPS exceeding estimates, the company's mixed guidance led to profit-taking.

The long-term outlook for CrowdStrike remains positive, with expectations of accelerating net new ARR and expanding adjusted operating income and free cash flow margins.
