          <p>Gary Grant, founder of The Entertainer, the UK's largest toy chain, is transferring 100% ownership of his multi-million-pound business to an employee trust. This move, chosen over a sale for profit, ensures staff receive a share of profits and a say in operations, preserving the company's legacy and family values. The company, which navigated challenges like the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, is in strong financial health with £6.7m pre-tax profits last year. This model aims to reward employees and maintain the company's Christian ethos, including Sunday closures and charity donations.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office is expanding its "deport now, appeal later" scheme to include 15 new countries, bringing the total to 23, allowing foreign criminals to be deported before their appeals are heard. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated this aims to prevent exploitation of the immigration system and fast-track removals. Offenders will appeal from their home countries via video link. This initiative also seeks to alleviate overcrowding in English and Welsh prisons, where foreign offenders constitute about 12% of the population, costing £54,000 per prisoner annually.</p>

          <p>A small fireball that penetrated a McDonough, Georgia home in June has been identified by University of Georgia planetary geologist Scott Harris as a meteorite formed 4.56 billion years ago, predating Earth by 20 million years. The 23-gram fragments belong to an asteroid group from the main asteroid belt, linked to a larger asteroid breakup 470 million years ago. This marks the 27th recovered meteorite in Georgia's history and one of only six witnessed falls. Scientists will propose naming it the McDonough Meteorite, emphasizing the importance of analyzing such space rocks for planetary defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New road safety proposals in England and Wales could require drivers over 70 to pass compulsory eye tests every three years upon licence renewal. This shake-up, expected in a new government strategy, also considers reducing the drink-driving limit to match Scotland's and introducing penalty points for unbelted passengers. The move follows a coroner's report criticizing the UK's "laxest in Europe" licensing system after four deaths linked to drivers with poor eyesight. While some defend older drivers, the government aims to reduce the 1,600 annual road deaths.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Tesla has formally applied to Ofgem, the British energy regulator, for a license to supply electricity to UK households and businesses, potentially starting next year. This move would allow Tesla, known for its electric vehicles, to compete in the UK energy market, leveraging its existing solar and battery storage products. The company already operates Tesla Electric in Texas, which optimizes energy consumption and rewards customers for returning excess energy to the grid. This expansion comes as Tesla faces a significant slump in European EV sales, with registrations dropping sharply in the UK and Germany.</p>

          <p>Beijing has unexpectedly relaxed home-buying restrictions, allowing residents to purchase new and second-hand homes outside the Fifth Ring Road. This move, which came earlier than market expectations, is seen as a positive step by analysts to strengthen market confidence and address concerns about delayed stimulus measures. Experts suggest that Shanghai and Shenzhen could soon follow suit, aligning with the central government's aim to remove buying curbs in non-central areas. This proactive approach by the government is intended to support the struggling property market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists are actively investigating how life originated on Earth, with an abundance of water being a key factor, particularly in deep-sea hydrothermal vents or tide pools. This research extends to exploring the potential for life on "water worlds" within our solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn's moons. This article delves into two water-related hypotheses for life's genesis on Earth, considering their implications for the existence of extraterrestrial life. The ongoing scientific inquiry aims to unravel one of humanity's biggest mysteries.</p>

          <p>Historic Marine Protected Area (MPA) status has been granted to World War One shipwreck sites in Scapa Bay, Orkney, by the Scottish government. This designation makes it a criminal offense to remove items from the 52-strong German High Seas fleet, deliberately scuttled in 1919. While some wrecks were previously protected as war graves, this widens legal powers against artifact removal, addressing concerns about vulnerability and loss of historical features. The sites, popular with divers, will see enhanced preservation, ensuring future generations can explore and learn from Scotland's underwater heritage, including the Queen of Sweden wreck off Shetland.</p>

          <p>The Perseids meteor shower, renowned as one of the best celestial displays, is set to peak this week, specifically early Wednesday for North America. However, the moon will be 84% full during this peak, significantly compromising visibility. Experts predict that bright moonlight will reduce the number of visible meteors by at least 75%, allowing only the brighter ones to be seen, with an expected rate of 10-20 per hour instead of the usual 50. Viewers are advised to seek dark, rural areas and consider watching a week after the peak for better conditions.</p>

          <p>A pioneering summer camp in Ukraine's Carpathian mountains offers group therapy and activities for children whose parents are missing due to the war, some presumed dead or held captive. The charity Gen.Ukrainian runs the camp, helping thousands of traumatized children living in a "frozen state," unable to grieve or plan for the future. Many children desperately search Russian social media for information, exposing them to violent content. The camp provides a safe space for expression, healing through art and movement, and fosters a sense of community among those sharing similar heartbreaking experiences.</p>
