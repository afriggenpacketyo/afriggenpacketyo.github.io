          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is intensifying efforts to address a significant shortage of air traffic controllers by aiming to hire 2,000 new trainees this year. Utilizing advanced simulation technology at its Oklahoma City facility, the FAA has streamlined the training process, reducing certification time by several weeks. This initiative, part of a larger infrastructure boost, is a direct response to staffing shortages that have caused flight delays at major airports. Officials state they are on track to meet their hiring goals, which they see as crucial for maintaining the safety of the skies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant acceleration in June, growing 5.8% year-on-year, which exceeded market forecasts. This surge is attributed to exporters capitalizing on a 90-day tariff truce with the United States to expedite shipments. Imports also saw an unexpected rise of 1.1%, contrasting with predictions of a decline and leading to a monthly trade surplus of nearly $114.8 billion. Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China's trade performance has remained robust through the first half of the year, showing resilience in its export sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Sexual Assault Survivor Gisele Pelicot Awarded France's Highest Civilian Honor</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 22:23:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a prominent symbol for women's rights in France, has been awarded the Legion of Honor, the nation's highest civilian award. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged and sexually assaulted her over a decade and invited dozens of other men to do the same. Her case, which resulted in the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, sparked a national debate on sexual violence. Pelicot's advocacy is credited with helping to advance reforms to France's legal definition of sexual assault to include the concept of consent.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector, beating economists' expectations. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the rest of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The government has downgraded its full-year GDP forecast and is rolling out grants to help businesses manage the impacts of global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated a willingness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market shows signs of a significant slowdown. He stated that he believes the path for interest rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay increases. This outlook comes as the UK economy experienced a minor contraction in May, adding pressure on the government to stimulate growth. The Bank's next decision on the current 4.25% interest rate is scheduled for early August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner as the second overall pick in the MLB draft, a choice deeply intertwined with personal resilience. Bremner's selection comes shortly after his mother passed away from breast cancer, a tragedy he said fueled his strong performance in the latter half of his college season. The Angels, aiming to win now, prioritized a college pitcher with a formidable fastball and changeup who could potentially reach the major leagues quickly. Bremner noted the poignant connection of being drafted by the Angels, stating he knows his mother is proud and watching over him.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations.

This contrasts with the past, when group tours and hotel-centric activities were the norm. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," with travelers from a diverse array of developing nations exploring destinations worldwide, creating a more multifaceted global travel landscape.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory is celebrating a major meteorological milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation, creating the longest unbroken sequence of such data in the UK and Ireland. Since July 14, 1795, observers have manually recorded measurements like temperature and air pressure in handwritten ledgers, a tradition that continues today alongside automated systems. This invaluable historical record has documented major weather events, like the "Night of the Big Wind" in 1839, and contributed to the science of meteorology. The continuity of the record was notably saved by a director's widow who stepped in to take observations in 1917.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following his administration's announcement of a plan to sell weapons to European allies for transfer to Ukraine. This move, described by Senator Lindsey Graham as a "turning point," would involve the U.S. selling sophisticated military equipment, such as Patriot missiles, to NATO countries, which would then supply Ukraine. The strategy aims to quickly arm Ukraine by using existing European stockpiles while backfilling them with new U.S. purchases. The plan is part of a broader effort to cripple Russia's economy and support Ukraine's defense.</p>
