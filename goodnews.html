          <p>President Trump praised the agreement between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel at a rally in Pennsylvania, stating it would keep U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh and create American jobs. Trump announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and claimed Nippon would invest $14 billion, including funds to increase steel production and modernize mills across several states. While emphasizing that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh and promising a $5,000 bonus for workers, Trump admitted he hadn't seen the final details of the deal, despite having previously opposed the sale to Nippon Steel. (not investment advice) The current administration had previously blocked the sale over national security concerns. Optimism for the deal is moderate, hinging on the final details and actual implementation.</p>

This initiative is part of China's push to digitally transform its coal industry, with Yimin being among the first to develop "intelligent coal mines."

          <p>China has completed its first overseas new-generation radio telescope in northern Thailand, bolstering a global scientific network that monitors deep space signals and tracks shifts in Earth's rotation and tectonic plates. The 13-metre radio antenna, jointly developed by the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and the National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand, was inaugurated in Chiang Mai. Together with a second telescope under construction in southern Thailand, the station will enhance deep-space tracking and high-precision Earth monitoring, contributing to more accurate GPS, climate research, and earthquake forecasting. The project underscores the growing scientific partnership between China and Thailand.</p>

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey indicated that UK defense spending is expected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034, with the strategic defense review based on this assumption. The review will recommend deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control the army's unmanned weapons. The Ministry of Defence will spend over ¬£1bn to develop technology to speed up decisions on the battlefield. New defense funding will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income.</p>
