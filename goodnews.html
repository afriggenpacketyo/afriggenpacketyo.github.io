          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced plans to deploy 50,000 of AMD's Instinct MI450 graphics processors, with the rollout beginning in the second half of 2026. This strategic move signals growing competition for Nvidia, which currently dominates the AI chip market with over 90% market share. The decision highlights a trend among cloud providers to offer AMD's GPUs as a viable alternative, particularly for AI inferencing tasks. This development follows other significant collaborations between AMD and major AI players like OpenAI, underscoring the increasing demand for diverse and powerful computing resources.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook's recent visit to China has aligned with the mainland launch of the new iPhone Air, which will support eSIM technology following regulatory approval. China's three major telecom operators have confirmed they will begin commercial trials for the eSIM function, a key feature that allows for thinner phone designs. The iPhone Air, priced from 7,999 yuan, will be available for pre-order on Friday, with shipments starting next week, about a month later than in other global markets. This development is considered a significant milestone for China's smartphone industry, paving the way for other domestic manufacturers to release eSIM-enabled devices.</p>

The story is set in the author's hometown of Kolkata, India, and explores themes of love, hope, and conflict amid a severe food shortage and climate crisis. It follows two families whose desperate efforts to protect their own children put them at odds with one another. Winfrey praised the book for its surprising narrative shifts, stating she has "never read a book quite like this," while Majumdar explained she wanted to explore what fierce parental love looks like in a time of extreme scarcity.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, driven by record-breaking trading revenue of $8.9 billion. The bank's profit increased by 12% to $14.39 billion, with overall revenue rising 9% to $47.12 billion. Strong performance in fixed income and equity trading, along with a 16% jump in investment banking fees, contributed to the robust results. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also highlighted growing uncertainty from geopolitical conditions and potential inflation, leading the bank to increase its provision for credit losses to $3.4 billion.

          <p>Rockefeller Capital Management, a wealth manager originating from the Rockefeller family office, has raised new capital from other prominent family offices, including those of Chanel's owners and the founder of Abrams Capital. This recapitalization has increased the firm's valuation to $6.6 billion, more than double its 2023 value of $3 billion. The new funding will support Rockefeller's expansion plans, which include hiring more advisors in key U.S. markets and exploring international partnerships in Singapore and the Middle East. CEO Greg Fleming highlighted that the long-term investment perspective of family offices aligns well with the firm's growth strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California has implemented a new set of laws aimed at protecting children online, addressing growing concerns over the risks posed by artificial intelligence and social media. One landmark law, SB 243, requires AI chatbots to disclose their non-human nature and prompt minors to take breaks, while also implementing safeguards against harmful content. Other new legislation mandates social media platforms to add mental health risk warnings and increases penalties for the distribution of deepfake pornography. The laws also require device makers like Apple and Google to integrate age-verification tools into their app stores, reflecting a broader push to hold tech companies accountable for user safety.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has fined luxury fashion brands Gucci, Chloe, and Loewe a total of over €157 million for violating EU competition rules. An investigation found that the companies illegally restricted independent retailers from setting their own online and offline prices for their products. The Commission stated that this anti-competitive behavior, which included dictating minimum prices and maximum discount rates, resulted in higher prices and reduced choices for consumers. The parent companies, Kering (Gucci), Richemont (Chloe), and LVMH (Loewe), were found to have interfered with their retailers' commercial strategies, thereby harming the single market.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new content guidelines for Instagram that will limit what teenage users can see to a level comparable to a PG-13 movie rating. The changes will hide accounts that share sexualized content or material related to drugs and alcohol from teens, and they will no longer be able to follow such accounts. This move aims to provide parents with a clearer, more familiar standard for the content their children can access on the platform. The update comes after sustained criticism of the company's handling of child safety and mental health concerns, and it represents another step in Meta's efforts to create a safer online environment for younger users.</p>

          <p>Former England cricketer Stuart Broad has stirred up the pre-Ashes rivalry by claiming Australia's current team is likely their "worst since 2010," the last time England won a series down under. Responding to a prediction of a 4-0 Australian victory from David Warner, Broad argued that while Australia are favorites at home, they face significant questions regarding their team composition and the fitness of captain Pat Cummins. He suggested that the combination of a weaker Australian side and a strong English squad creates the potential for a highly competitive series. England has struggled in Australia since their 2010-11 triumph, suffering three consecutive heavy series defeats.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs announced a significant 37% jump in quarterly profit, exceeding expectations due to a surge in investment banking fees and strong performance in its asset and wealth management division. The bank's advisory fees grew by 60% as corporations revived merger and acquisition plans, while revenue from asset and wealth management rose 17% to $4.4 billion. The positive results reflect a favorable market for dealmaking and high stock market levels, which have boosted management fees. Trading revenue also remained resilient, with equities trading up 7%, showcasing broad strength across the firm's major business lines. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey in Germany has found that the vast majority of employees are not worried about artificial intelligence posing a threat to their job security within the next five years. Only about 5% of respondents expressed concern, despite studies suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in the country involve tasks that could be automated. The survey also indicated a limited understanding of AI among the workforce, with less than 40% of employees having received any formal training on the subject, even in companies where it is already in use. This widespread lack of concern suggests a potential disconnect between public perception and the transformative impact AI is expected to have on the labor market.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills has officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, entering a crowded Democratic primary with the goal of unseating Republican incumbent Susan Collins. Mills, who was reportedly recruited by national party leaders, highlighted her experience as governor and her confrontations with President Donald Trump as key qualifications for the race. Her entry sets up a potentially divisive primary against more progressive candidates like Graham Platner, who is endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders and is running on a platform to reshape the Democratic party. The race is considered a top target for Democrats in their effort to regain control of the Senate.</p>
