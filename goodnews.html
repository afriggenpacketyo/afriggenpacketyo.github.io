          <p>H&M's shares experienced a significant 10% jump on Thursday, following the high street retailer's announcement of better-than-expected financial results for its fiscal third quarter. This strong performance indicates that the company's ongoing turnaround strategy is effectively gaining pace. Operating profit surged by 40% year-on-year, reaching 4.9 billion Swedish krona ($522 million), comfortably exceeding the 3.7 billion Swedish krona forecast by analysts. Furthermore, net sales for the three-month period ending in August were reported at 57 billion Swedish krona, also surpassing the anticipated 56.8 billion. This positive financial update reflects growing investor confidence in H&M's strategic direction and market position.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index soared to a fresh record high on Thursday, extending its gaining streak to six consecutive sessions, with the broader Topix index also closing at a new peak. This robust performance in Japanese markets diverged from the mixed trading observed across other Asia-Pacific regions, where investors continued to divest from tech giants like Nvidia and Oracle for a second day. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index recorded gains, boosted by strong debuts from Chery and Xiaomi shares, while South Korea's Kospi ended marginally below flat, and Taiwan's Taiex experienced a retreat. Globally, US stock futures showed little change as market participants anticipated Thursday's release of weekly jobless claims data, a key indicator influencing the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy decisions.

          <p>Dan Pembroke, a two-time Paralympic and world champion in the F13 javelin for athletes with visual impairment, has uniquely blended his athletic visualization strategies with craft beer brewing. He developed "Paris Gold" as a tangible representation of his goal before his Paralympic triumph and is now crafting a "Milan" beer, an Italian pilsner, to inspire compatriots heading to the 2026 Winter Games. Pembroke's remarkable journey includes overcoming an elbow injury and deteriorating eyesight, leading him to Para-sport in 2019 after a seven-year hiatus. Following his successful defense of the Paralympic crown in Paris with a world record throw, he is now preparing for the Para-athletics World Championships in New Delhi, motivated by a rekindled hunger and the anticipation of welcoming his first child.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was discovered in Spain over two decades ago has finally been identified as 31-year-old Russian citizen Liudmila Zavada, thanks to Interpol's "Operation Identify Me" campaign. Her body, found in July 2005 near Barcelona and dubbed "the woman in pink," was subject to a suspicious death investigation that previously failed to uncover her identity. The breakthrough came after Turkish police ran her fingerprints through a national database, followed by a DNA match with a relative in Russia. This marks the third identification through the initiative, offering renewed hope for other cold cases and highlighting the power of international police cooperation.</p>

          <p>Ryan Gravenberch, Liverpool's midfielder, has seen a remarkable resurgence, now being hailed as "one of the best midfielders in Europe" under coach Arne Slot. After a challenging season at Bayern Munich, Gravenberch was revitalized at Anfield, initially excelling as a holding midfielder and now thriving with increased attacking freedom. His defensive metrics remain strong, but his offensive contributions have soared, including two league goals this season after none in the previous. Experts credit Slot's trust and strategic deployment for unlocking Gravenberch's potential, fulfilling the promise seen in him since his Ajax days, despite initial comparisons to Frank Rijkaard creating high expectations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers significantly reduced their magic number to just one, bringing them to the cusp of another National League West division championship, with a resilient 5-4 extra-innings victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. The game highlighted the team's adaptive strategies, notably featuring starting pitchers Roki Sasaki and Clayton Kershaw in unexpected but effective relief roles, addressing the bullpen's recent inconsistencies. Sasaki, making his first major league appearance since an early May shoulder injury, flashed promising signs with a scoreless seventh inning, while Kershaw, in his first relief outing since 2019, calmly navigated the ninth. Tommy Edman's decisive RBI single in the 11th inning secured the hard-fought win, underscoring the team's improvisation and determination as they fine-tune their approach for the upcoming postseason.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's requirement for states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive certain Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants is unconstitutional. This decision is a legal setback for the administration's efforts to withhold funding from "sanctuary" cities and states. US District Judge William Smith sided with 20 states, arguing the policy was "arbitrary and capricious" and unconstitutional, as it could deprive them of critical disaster funds. New York Attorney General Letitia James praised the ruling, stating the government cannot prioritize its immigration agenda over public safety, while DHS asserted its commitment to enforcing immigration laws.</p>
