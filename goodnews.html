          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region had a mixed opening after the U.S. Federal Reserve implemented an anticipated interest rate cut on Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell characterized the move as a "risk management cut," with the central bank signaling two additional cuts may occur by year's end. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw gains, Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declined, reflecting varied investor sentiment across the region. The decision comes as the Bank of Japan begins its own policy meeting, where it is expected to hold its rates steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the storm is not projected to pose an immediate threat to land, with forecasts showing it tracking north of the Caribbean. However, meteorologists anticipate that Gabrielle will strengthen over the weekend, potentially developing into a low-grade hurricane by Sunday. While its path remains uncertain, the system could approach Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify over open waters, according to current projections from the National Hurricane Center.</p>

          <h2>Research Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol Through Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Researchers from UC Berkeley measured the ethanol content in figs and plum-like fruits eaten by the primates, finding an average alcohol content of about 0.3% by weight. While this steady, low-dose exposure is not enough to cause intoxication, it supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors, who were drawn to the scent of ethanol in ripe fruit.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has urged the government not to eliminate Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs), which provide individualized support for children with special educational needs. In a new report, the Education Select Committee recommended keeping the legally binding plans as a form of accountability for parents. The committee also called for new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and increased teacher training to create a more inclusive mainstream education system. The recommendations come as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to keep its key interest rate at 4% during its upcoming meeting on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still at 3.8%, nearly double the 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk further cuts this year. The decision in the UK will come a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to cut its own interest rates, highlighting differing economic pressures faced by the two central banks.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that the move does not fundamentally alter major market themes. He argued that the quarter-point cut was widely anticipated and that investors should not make significant portfolio changes based solely on Fed statements. Cramer noted that the mixed market reaction, with the Dow up slightly but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq down, may have been due to some investors hoping for a more aggressive cut. He suggested that key sectors like technology and banking remain well-positioned. (not investment advice)</p>
