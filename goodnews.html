          <p>Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, will receive a $14 million settlement from Los Angeles County. A judge declared him factually innocent in 2022, following a review initiated by the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The case against Torres was built on unreliable witness testimony, and investigators were later criticized for ignoring evidence that pointed to another suspect and failing to disclose exculpatory information. The settlement resolves Torres's federal civil lawsuit against the county for the decades of wrongful incarceration he endured.</p>

          <p>TV chef Si King of the Hairy Bikers recently visited the site of the Sycamore Gap tree for the first time since it was illegally felled in September 2023, an event he described as deeply personal and infuriating. King, who had a strong connection to the Northumberland landmark, had avoided the site due to his emotional reaction to the "mindless" act of vandalism. During his visit for a BBC documentary, he inspected the stump, where new green shoots are now growing, and reflected on the tree's significance as a place of solace. He also shared that he would have visited the spot to grieve his late co-star Dave Myers had it still been standing.</p>

          <h2>Review Recommends Renaming 'Physician Associates' to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:02:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed as "assistants" to prevent patients from confusing them with doctors. The review, prompted by debate over the roles' responsibilities, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from physicians. Authored by Professor Gillian Leng, the report notes that a lack of a clear national plan for these roles led to confusion and instances where PAs covered doctor shortages without adequate supervision. The review aims to improve patient safety and clarity within the NHS workforce.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Lawmakers Reintroduce DIGNITY Act for Immigration Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 19:01:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan group of House members, led by Republican Maria Elvira Salazar and Democrat Veronica Escobar, has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The legislation proposes a "Dignity Program" that would offer a seven-year path to legal status for undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. for at least five years, pass background checks, and pay restitution. The bill also includes provisions for increased border security, asylum system reforms, and protections for sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. The reintroduction comes amid heightened scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close for five years starting in 2027 for a major £50 million renovation. The project will address structural decay caused by the building's hot, humid internal climate and aims to upgrade the facility to net-zero emissions by replacing gas boilers with heat pumps. The ambitious plan involves moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad, and replacing all 16,000 panes of glass with better-insulated material. This extensive makeover will be the first since the 1980s for the iconic Victorian glass house, which first opened to the public in 1848.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized claims that its products can help people feel calm and reduce stress. The ad promoted a drink with ingredients like magnesium, Lion's Mane, and L-theanine, using language such as "crafted for calm." The ASA ruled that these claims were not on the permitted list of health benefits for food and drink marketing and implied the product could treat anxiety, which is prohibited. Trip stated it had removed the claims while seeking external advice but hopes to be able to substantiate them in the future.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia, stating he will lower a threatened 32% tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Trump claimed the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets, with the country agreeing to purchase $15 billion in American energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets. The deal came after the White House renewed tariff threats against dozens of countries. Terms of the agreement were not immediately confirmed by Indonesia, which is one of America's top 25 trading partners. This follows a pattern where the administration has announced deals while key details remain unconfirmed.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the U.S. and its NATO allies are coordinating to send more advanced military aid to Ukraine, including 17 additional Patriot missile systems. The move signals growing frustration with Russia's unwillingness to negotiate an end to the war. Shipments of previously paused U.S. armaments, such as Patriot, AIM, and Hellfire missiles, are now reportedly flowing into Ukraine. This increased support comes as President Trump has threatened Russia with severe tariffs if it does not engage in peace talks, a change from his previous stance. The Kremlin called the U.S. statements "very serious" and said it needed time to analyze them.</p>
