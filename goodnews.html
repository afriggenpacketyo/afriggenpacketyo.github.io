          <p>The use of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is surging, with nearly half of Americans having used them at least once. While consumers appreciate the interest-free installment plans, traditional banks and credit card companies are wary of the trend. These services divert transaction revenue from credit cards and create what some experts call a "giant black hole" in consumer credit profiles, making it difficult for lenders to assess a borrower's complete financial health and risk.

          <p>Republican Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, a prominent voice on foreign policy, has announced he will not seek another term in 2026. After serving 11 terms and chairing both the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security Committees, McCaul stated he is ready for a "new challenge" in the national security realm. A strong advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine, he plans to serve out the remainder of his current term. His retirement adds to a number of departures from the House as lawmakers seek other offices or leave public service.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, son of President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly transferred from New York University's main Manhattan campus to its program in Washington, D.C. This move allows him to live closer to his parents while continuing his studies. The NYU D.C. program is highly selective, accepting up to 120 students per semester, and focuses on politics, public policy, and journalism through a combination of coursework and professional internships. It is unclear if Barron has changed his major from business to align with the program's focus.</p>
