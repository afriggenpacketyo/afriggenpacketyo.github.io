          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has provided a $20 billion currency swap line to Argentina's central bank to address liquidity concerns and prevent a potential financial crisis. Announced by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the intervention aims to stabilize the volatile Argentine peso ahead of the country's key midterm elections. While the move is intended to support an important regional ally and calm credit markets, it has drawn criticism, with some experts questioning its necessity and the potential risks involved, given Argentina's history of debt defaults.

          <p>Despite its stock performance being stagnant recently, Meta Platforms has received a positive outlook from Citi, which placed the company on a "90-day catalyst watch." The firm's optimism is based on signs of growth in Meta's core advertising business and an increasing share of ad budgets, even as it faces new competition from OpenAI's video generation tool, Sora. Citi analysts believe these positive trends in advertising could serve as the catalyst to drive the stock higher, maintaining a "buy" rating with a price target of $915. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to new guidance from researchers at King's College London, consuming several kiwi fruits daily can be an effective way to alleviate constipation. The research, which reviewed existing evidence, also suggests that drinking mineral water rich in magnesium is more beneficial than tap water and that magnesium oxide supplements can improve symptoms. This advice offers practical, food-based alternatives to the common recommendation of simply increasing dietary fiber. The guidance aims to help the one in ten people affected by chronic constipation by providing more diverse and accessible options for relief.</p>

          <p>Actors Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri star in the new psychological thriller "After the Hunt," directed by Luca Guadagnino. The film explores the complex dynamics between a college professor (Roberts) and her student (Edebiri) after an accusation of misconduct is made against a close colleague. In an interview, the actors emphasized that the movie is designed to provoke conversation and debate about truth, power, and morality, without offering simple answers. Edebiri also shared her nervousness about an on-screen confrontation where her character slaps the iconic Roberts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses several pervasive myths about managing credit card debt that can negatively impact personal finances. It clarifies that carrying a balance does not improve one's credit score and only results in paying unnecessary interest. The piece also warns that making only minimum payments is an ineffective strategy for debt reduction, as most of the payment goes toward interest charges. Finally, it explains that closing old credit card accounts can actually harm a credit score by reducing available credit and shortening credit history.</p>

          <p>The end of the two-year war between Israel and Hamas, marked by the release of all living hostages, has fostered a surprising sense of hope in the region. This article explores this "paradoxical optimism," citing Palestinian philosopher Sari Nusseibeh, who believes the immense price paid by both sides may force a new perspective on peace. The deal, brokered by the Trump administration, outlines a new security framework for Gaza run by a technocratic committee and backed by international forces. While fragile, the moment is seen by some as a potential turning point after years of devastating conflict.</p>

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers are reassessing their options for a new head coach after their primary target, Steven Gerrard, ruled himself out of consideration for the position. The club has reportedly compiled a new shortlist with more than two candidates to replace the recently dismissed Russell Martin. While former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl is said to have held talks with the club, other previously linked names like Graham Potter and Michael Carrick are not believed to be among the current candidates.

          <p>A landmark ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has commenced with the release of 20 living Israeli hostages from Gaza. In exchange, Israel is freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.

While the exchange has brought moments of relief and celebration for families on both sides, uncertainty remains regarding the return of deceased hostages, and officials have cautioned that the truce remains fragile.</p>

The agreement shields the company from threatened tariffs and was the result of months of negotiations led by CEO Pascal Soriot. Key elements of the company's strategy included announcing billions in U.S. investments and cultivating relationships with administration officials. While AstraZeneca made some concessions on pricing, the deal provides market clarity and is viewed as a strategic victory for the pharmaceutical giant.</p>
