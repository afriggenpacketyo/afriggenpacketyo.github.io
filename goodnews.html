          <p>Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng reported delivering over 34,600 cars in June, marking its eighth consecutive month of strong sales performance. This achievement comes as an intense price war continues to roil China's EV market, where market leader BYD is expanding its dominance. In contrast, competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed more modest or declining monthly sales figures. The fierce competition has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for being non-productive, even as new players like Xiaomi enter the market with aggressive pricing strategies that put pressure on established brands like Tesla.

The ruling provides temporary relief for Haitians who have built lives in the U.S., relying on the program for legal residency and work permits.

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant strategic change for the company's contract chip manufacturing business. The potential shift would involve no longer marketing its 18A chipmaking technology, a process that has cost billions to develop, to external customers. Instead, the company would focus its resources on its next-generation 14A process, where it believes it can better compete with rivals like TSMC. This move aims to attract major clients such as Apple and Nvidia and represents a departure from the strategy of the previous CEO, signaling a major pivot to revive the struggling chipmaker.

The law will phase out the sale and manufacture of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032.
