          <p>China's defense ministry announced the opening of three new military academies, sparking significant interest among young Chinese citizens, with the announcement garnering over 8 million views on Weibo. While recruitment numbers will remain consistent with previous years, these new academies represent a restructuring effort to create a more efficient military education system focused on war preparation. This restructuring includes merging units from existing military schools and removing the requirement for work experience before students can become commanders, allowing them to pursue postgraduate studies immediately after graduation, streamlining the path to leadership roles within the military. The move reflects China's ongoing efforts to modernize its military and attract talented individuals to serve their country. Optimism surrounding the ability to serve the country is palpable.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining renewed attention as Japan may face its first absence of giant pandas in over half a century. Decisions on leasing pandas abroad are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks, and experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a possible visit by a Chinese political leader to Japan. Currently, Japan hosts six pandas, but four are set to return to China, with the remaining two due to return next February. Amidst rising tensions with the United States, this gesture could serve to stabilize China's relations with Japan.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence usage increases, researchers emphasize the need for more standardized testing and regulations to address potentially harmful responses. Undesirable behaviors like hate speech and copyright infringements are compounded by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Red teaming, a practice involving individuals testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one method for evaluating risks. Researchers advocate for third-party testing and standardized "AI flaw" reports to better understand and mitigate the risks posed by AI tools.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships revealed that parents who rarely face defiance avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, instead using language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries fosters cooperation. The article suggests alternative phrases to replace toxic ones, focusing on respect, emotional safety, and involvement to create conditions where cooperation feels natural. By shifting from control and criticism to empathy and leadership, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
