          <h2>Barry Diller's Memoir Explores Instinct Over Data in Media Success</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 12:41:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an excerpt from his memoir, "Who Knew," media executive Barry Diller reflects on his career, emphasizing the importance of instinct over relying solely on data, particularly in creative decision-making. Diller recounts his time at ABC, where he championed the "Movie of the Week," and shares anecdotes about trusting his gut to identify successful projects like "Brian's Song" and "The Night Stalker." He argues that over-reliance on data can stifle creativity and obscure the essence of a good idea. Diller believes that understanding human instinct is better than MBA case studies. Relevant context is Diller's long and successful career in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Google has agreed to pay Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle allegations that the company violated the data privacy rights of state residents. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, claiming the company unlawfully tracked and collected users' private data. The settlement covers allegations related to Chrome's incognito mode, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos. While Google does not admit wrongdoing, the company stated that the settlement resolves old claims related to product policies that have already been changed. The settlement is a major win for Texans' privacy, sending a message to Big Tech that they will be held accountable for abusing trust.</p>

          <p>A Soviet space probe, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 to explore Venus, has reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after a malfunction prevented it from reaching its destination. The probe, part of the Venera program, was intended to deliver a lander to Venus but remained in Earth's orbit for over half a century. Roscosmos confirmed the reentry, stating that the spacecraft no longer exists. The probe, weighing nearly 500 kilograms, had been tracked by space agencies due to concerns about potential dangers upon reentry. Russia plans to launch a new mission to Venus, known as Venera-D, continuing the Soviet-era program.</p>
