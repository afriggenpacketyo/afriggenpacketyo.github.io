          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, aiming to mend strained ties with President Xi Jinping. Both nations are grappling with the economic impact of US tariffs, which have recently increased on Indian goods. Despite a history of border disputes and mistrust, including the 2020 Galwan Valley clash, a stronger relationship could offer mutual economic benefits and present a united front in a multipolar world. The article highlights that India's attendance at the SCO reflects a strategic shift following a downturn in relations with Washington, signaling Delhi's diverse foreign policy options. This visit could mark a turning point in managing expectations of other global powers regarding Asia's stability.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime, the 25th seed, defeated world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a four-set comeback at the US Open, securing his spot in the last 16. This victory marks Auger-Aliassime's first Grand Slam win against a top-five opponent and his return to the second week in New York since 2021. The three-hour, 48-minute match concluded late, highlighting ongoing debates about Grand Slam scheduling and late-night finishes. Zverev's early US Open exit since 2018 signals a faltering hard-court season for the German, while Auger-Aliassime's performance offers a significant boost after a period of uneven seasons and injuries. He will next face Russia’s Andrey Rublev.</p>

The next drawing is scheduled for Monday at 11 p.m. ET, with an estimated cash value of $498.4 million. This marks the sixth time the top prize has crossed the billion-dollar threshold in Powerball's 33-year history. No one has claimed the jackpot since May 31, contributing to the massive rollover. The article notes that four of the five previous billion-plus jackpots were won in California, including the record-setting $2.04 billion prize in 2022.</p>

These drones are used to broadcast loud sounds like AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck,' movie clips, and live human voices to scare the predators away. This experiment is a response to increasing conflicts between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, with nonlethal deterrence methods being crucial. The article notes that while the technology shows promise in reducing livestock deaths and promoting coexistence, its high cost and limitations in wooded areas pose challenges for widespread adoption. Scientists are still assessing whether wolves might eventually habituate to these novel deterrents. One notable success involved a drone pilot directly telling a wolf to 'get out of here,' prompting its immediate retreat.</p>

This ambition reflects Tron's growing influence in global stablecoin transactions, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to reference assets like the US dollar.

          <p>The USC Trojans football team achieved a resounding 73-13 victory over Missouri State in their season opener, marking the most points scored by USC since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava had a seamless performance, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before halftime. The offense averaged 7.6 yards per carry, with three plays exceeding 60 yards, and the defense recorded five sacks and a pick-six. This blowout, while impressive, served more as a well-orchestrated scrimmage against a less competitive opponent, as Missouri State was making its FBS debut. The article notes that despite the dominant score, the true measure of USC's strength remains to be seen against higher-tier competition.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in its beer consumption habits, with overall beer sales plummeting to their lowest in over 30 years, while non-alcoholic varieties surge in popularity. Sales of alcohol-free beer have more than doubled since 2013, even as traditional beer sales fell by 6.3% in the first half of 2025. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting, with non-alcoholic options now making up a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events as a healthy alternative. The article notes a growing health consciousness among younger Germans, who are consuming alcohol more mindfully. Despite this trend, traditional beer remains deeply embedded in German culture, particularly at folk festivals.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series is making a comeback with a remake of its third installment, 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' a decade after its acclaimed creator, Hideo Kojima, had an acrimonious split with publisher Konami. The article explores the reasons behind Kojima's departure, widely believed to be due to the spiraling costs of 'Metal Gear Solid V.' Despite the series' significant impact on cinematic gaming and its exploration of complex themes, Konami shifted focus away from console games after Kojima left. The decision to remake 'Metal Gear Solid 3' is attributed to its strong fan base, its position as a prequel, and the current trend of successful video game remakes. Early reviews suggest the remake is a faithful recreation, preserving the original's essence while updating graphics and audio.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' hosted by Davina McCall, which blends elements of 'Love Island,' 'Married at First Sight,' and 'Survivor.' The premise involves couples meeting briefly, having a fake wedding, and then being stranded on a remote tropical island to test if love can thrive under challenging, isolated conditions. Contestants describe the experience as 'hell,' citing issues like mosquitoes, extreme heat, lack of personal hygiene products, and basic toilet facilities. However, participants appreciate the show's focus on authenticity and stripping away superficiality, believing it allows for deeper connections. The article suggests that the show's slightly older contestant demographic reflects a trend of people settling down later and seeking more meaningful relationships. The show aims to challenge typical dating formats by forcing genuine interaction and trust-building.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying an unusual arsenal, including drones and sniffer dogs, to combat the eight-toothed spruce bark beetle, a major threat to the country's forests. This tiny but destructive beetle has ravaged European spruce trees, and after discovering a breeding population in Kent, the UK realized the pests were arriving via wind, not just imported wood. Drones survey vast forest areas for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs are being trialed to detect the beetles' pheromones and frass, particularly in hard-to-inspect timber stacks. The article highlights that these high-tech and natural methods have led to the UK becoming the first country to eradicate Ips Typographus from its controlled risk areas. However, rising beetle populations in Europe, exacerbated by climate change, pose ongoing incursion risks, necessitating continued vigilance and advanced modeling to predict their spread.</p>

          <h2>Early School Attendance Critical for Preventing Persistent Absence in English Pupils</h2>

          <p>New government data for England indicates that pupils who missed school during the first week of September 2024 were significantly more likely to become 'persistently absent' throughout the academic year. Over half of those partially absent in week one eventually missed at least 10% of school, compared to only 14% of full attendees. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize early attendance for the 2025 term, emphasizing that 'every day of school missed is a day stolen from a child's future.' While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains higher than pre-Covid levels. The article notes that despite incentives and support programs, unauthorized term-time holidays and medical treatments abroad continue to contribute to absence issues, highlighting the need for a more strategic approach beyond school gates.</p>
