        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-viewed film ever, surpassing 236 million watches since its June release. The movie, produced by Sony Pictures Animation, follows a fictional K-pop girl group using music and combat to fight demons. Its success is attributed to strong word-of-mouth, viral social media content, eye-catching animation, and a catchy soundtrack featuring K-pop industry veterans. The film has also achieved significant musical milestones, with songs topping global charts and a sing-along version becoming Netflix's first number one at the US box office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, influenced by China's industrial profits data and new U.S. tariffs on India. China's industrial profits saw a smaller decline of 1.5% in July, indicating a recovery trend. Meanwhile, additional 25% U.S. tariffs on India's exports, bringing total duties to 50%, took effect. Japan's Nikkei was marginally higher, boosted by Nikon, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight movements. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw modest gains, with some analysts noting growing optimism in the latter.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to counter negative narratives, profiling locals and highlighting record visitor numbers in 2024. This initiative unfolds while National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing cleanup duties in public parks. While some Guard members patrol with police, others handle logistics and community projects like litter removal, creating unusual optics for the capital. The city aims to build on tourism momentum, especially with America's 250th anniversary in 2026, despite projected drops in international visitation.</p>

Her serve remains an area for improvement, a known issue this season.

          <h2>China's Industrial Profits See Slowest Decline in Five Months During July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 22:36:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at stabilizing consumer prices and enhancing corporate margins. While state-backed firms experienced a 7.5% profit drop in the first seven months, businesses with foreign investments saw profits rise by 1.8%. The manufacturing and utilities sectors recorded profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry's bottom line. This data suggests some positive shifts in China's industrial economic landscape.</p>

          <p>Key Senate contests are forming for the 2026 midterm elections, with Democrats aiming to flip four seats to gain a majority against a Republican-controlled chamber. Democrats must defend 13 seats while Republicans hold 24, many in states won by President Trump. High-profile open seats due to Democratic retirements, such as in North Carolina and New Hampshire, present opportunities for both parties. Contested primaries are also shaping up in states like Georgia and Texas, promising expensive and closely watched battles that will define the next Senate's composition.</p>

Despite some reentry heating damage to its protective skirt and a control flap, the vehicle maintained control to a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This flight is a major step forward for SpaceX and its plans for Mars colonization, as well as for NASA's lunar landing program, despite remaining technical hurdles.</p>
