          <p>President Trump attended the G7 summit in Canada, where discussions centered on international conflict and trade agreements. During a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump showcased a recently signed trade agreement, although he initially misspoke, attributing it to the European Union. The agreement included details on steel and aluminum quotas, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick determining the amount of products eligible for tariff exemptions. Trump also praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister, highlighting the importance of the trade deal for job creation and income generation.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza performed a Spanish version of ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, defying instructions to sing it in English, in response to immigration sweeps in Los Angeles. The performance has sparked discussions about the origins of the Spanish translation, known as ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù and the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Peruvian immigrant. Arias's translation was commissioned by the U.S. State Department in 1945 to strengthen ties with Latin American countries during World War II, and was considered the only official translation of the anthem. Nezza emphasizes that the song symbolizes American pride and the significant role of Latinos in building the nation.</p>

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, founder of Sohu.com, advised college graduates to consider starting businesses rather than pursuing graduate school or immediate start-up plans. Citing his own experiences, Zhang suggested that practical experience gained from working at a company is more valuable than postgraduate degrees. He obtained a PhD in physics at MIT before establishing Internet Technologies China, which later became Sohu.com. Zhang's advice encourages graduates to gain know-how from working at a company before considering starting their own businesses.</p>

          <p>Circle's stock price experienced a significant surge after CEO Jeremy Allaire suggested that stablecoins are approaching their "iPhone moment." Allaire argued that stablecoins have yet to reach their full potential but could soon become ubiquitous in various applications. The stock jumped as much as 22% to over $168 in early trading Monday, which is more than five times its $31 IPO price. The company is positioning itself to lead the charge in making stablecoins more accessible and integrated into everyday transactions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are competing to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada for the first time since 1993, aiming to break a 30-year drought. Ice hockey is deeply ingrained in Canadian identity, with a significant portion of NHL players being Canadian. The repeated losses have united Canadians against the US, especially amid trade tensions. While the Oilers began the series strong, concerns arise that history could repeat itself, with Game 6 being a do-or-die situation for the team. </p>

          <p>China is leveraging its dominance in rare earth elements as a trump card in the ongoing trade war with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in modern technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles, medical equipment, and military applications. With this leverage, China recently concluded high-level trade talks with the U.S. in London, agreeing "in principle to a framework" for review by top leaders. This marks a significant shift from the 2018 trade talks during Trump's first term, where Beijing's attempts at moral persuasion failed.</p>
