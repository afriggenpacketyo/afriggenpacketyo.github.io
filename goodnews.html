          <p>This Vox article addresses how to approach conversations with family and friends who are well-off but don't donate much to charity, offering advice on challenging them without causing discomfort or defensiveness. The article emphasizes accepting others as they are and understanding their perspectives, which may include a scarcity mindset or different ideas about doing good. It also warns against "do-gooder derogation," where people react negatively to those who seem morally superior and suggests focusing on the personal satisfaction derived from giving rather than moral arguments, using shared rituals like Thanksgiving to introduce the topic of charitable giving.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses emerging research into delaying or eliminating menopause, questioning the assumption that it's an inevitable part of aging for women. While the loss of estrogen associated with menopause is linked to various health risks, the idea of stopping menopause raises concerns about societal pressure on women to remain young and fertile. Experts are exploring hormone therapy and techniques like ovarian tissue cryopreservation to extend ovarian function and potentially reduce the risk of chronic illnesses, with some advocating for treatments that could benefit those experiencing early menopause. The article also considers the social and emotional benefits of menopause, such as liberation from menstruation and childbearing worries, and the importance of accepting aging rather than constantly fighting it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from DW explores how learning new languages physically changes the brain and increases cognitive abilities, with research showing that neural pathways reshape when learning a new language. The process involves rewiring brain circuits for sound perception and language selection, enhancing connectivity between brain regions involved in attention, memory, and cognitive control. While learning languages as a child offers advantages due to greater brain plasticity, studies indicate that multilingualism improves cognitive skills like memory and problem-solving, though it's unclear if this equates to higher intelligence.</p>

          <p>Stephen Curry scored 14 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter, and Buddy Hield made nine 3-pointers to lead the Golden State Warriors to a 103-89 Game 7 victory over the Houston Rockets. The Rockets, despite winning 52 games and earning the No. 2 seed, struggled in the decisive game, shooting poorly from long range. Alperen Sengun led Houston with 21 points and 14 rebounds, but the Warriors' late surge secured the series win.</p>
