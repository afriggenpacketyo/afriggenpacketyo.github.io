        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in its second-quarter revenues, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. The state-owned oil giant posted an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still surpassed analyst expectations. Despite the revenue dip, CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism, forecasting a significant oil demand increase in the second half of 2025 and maintaining capital expenditure guidance. The company is also focusing on cost-cutting measures and expanding its natural gas production to meet future demand. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's beleaguered property market may be showing signs of hitting a bottom, according to some analysts. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast, now predicting a smaller decline in new home sales for the year due to better-than-expected first-half performance. The stabilization is partly attributed to the growing market share of state-owned developers, which has helped restore some stability to the sector. This potential turnaround comes after a prolonged crisis that began in 2021, suggesting the downturn might be shorter than some investors had feared. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The entertainment industry is capitalizing on the growing year-round popularity of horror, with attractions like Universal's Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas offering permanent haunted experiences. This trend reflects a cultural shift where horror is no longer confined to the Halloween season, driven by the success of dark-themed shows and a desire for more intense, immersive entertainment. While there are challenges, such as a tough tourism market, companies are betting that audiences are ready for year-round frights. Experts suggest the genre's boom is partly due to its ability to metaphorically address modern anxieties like climate change and political instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a gesture of goodwill, South Korea has started to dismantle the loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the border into North Korea. This move, ordered by President Lee Jae Myung's administration, is described as a practical measure to ease inter-Korean tensions and follows a suspension of the broadcasts in June. The loudspeakers have been a contentious feature of the volatile relationship since the 1960s, playing everything from K-pop to weather reports to encourage defections. While seen as a step towards reconciliation, it is uncertain if this action alone will be enough to thaw deeply frozen diplomatic relations.</p>

          <p>Netflix is strategically building its own ecosystem of reality television personalities, moving stars from hit shows like "Too Hot to Handle" into new programs and roles to create a cohesive "Netflix Reality Universe." This approach, exemplified by the upcoming show "Let's Marry Harry" starring Harry Jowsey, helps the streamer retain audiences and build a loyal subculture around its unscripted content. By cross-promoting talent, Netflix boosts the stars' social media clout, which in turn drives viewers back to the platform. This strategy is a key part of the company's effort to dominate the unscripted programming space.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands has announced it will be the first NATO member to purchase US weaponry for Ukraine through a new alliance mechanism. The Dutch government is committing €500 million to buy American defense systems, including Patriot missile parts, which will then be transferred to Ukraine. This initiative, known as the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), was designed to allow NATO allies to fund US military aid for Ukraine, a condition set by President Trump to continue support. The move is intended to increase pressure on Russia and bolster Ukraine's defense against ongoing attacks.</p>

          <p>This article details a journalist's experiment using ChatGPT as a mediator for disagreements with her boyfriend, reflecting a growing trend among Gen Z. While the AI chatbot offered some useful, objective feedback and helped defuse certain arguments, the process was fraught with challenges. The bot exhibited biases present in its training data, such as stereotyping gender roles in emotional labor, and its advice often lacked the nuance required for complex human relationships. The author concluded that while AI can be a tool for reflection, it cannot replace the essential work of direct, empathetic communication between partners.</p>

          <p>Palestinian national team striker Wessam Abou Ali has signed with MLS team Columbus Crew as a designated player, capping a remarkable summer. The Danish-born forward was instrumental in Palestine's near-qualification for the World Cup and starred for Egyptian club Al-Ahly, winning the league's golden boot and an African Champions League title. His journey is especially notable given a 2021 on-pitch collapse due to a heart condition and a subsequent serious injury that nearly ended his career.
