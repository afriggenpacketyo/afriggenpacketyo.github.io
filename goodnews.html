          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, arrived in New Jersey after being released from ICE detention in Louisiana, following a federal judge's order. Khalil, a green card holder, had been in ICE custody for over 100 days due to the Trump administration's efforts to deport him for his involvement in campus protests against Israel, though he has not been charged with any crimes. Judge Michael Fabiarz ruled that Khalil was not a threat or flight risk, deeming his detention an attempt to punish him for his anti-Israel speech, a violation of his First Amendment rights. Khalil's arrest sparked protests and discussions about free speech, with other activists also being detained and later released. </p>

A federal judge ordered his release, finding no evidence he was a flight risk or danger to the public, and ruling that detaining someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from making significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. Judge Indira Talwani struck down a policy change that would have stripped universities of millions of dollars in research funding, arguing that the move was arbitrary and contrary to law. The policy change capped indirect costs for future NSF awards to universities at 15% of direct research costs. The University of California estimated the change would cost it nearly $100 million annually. </p>

Researchers analyzed data from 300 rural dam projects across 35 countries and found that rural populations have been underestimated by 53% to 84% between 1975 and 2010. This discrepancy could stem from a lack of resources for precise data collection in rural areas.
