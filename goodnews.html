          <p>Buffalo Bills quarterback and NFL MVP Josh Allen has signed a new endorsement deal with New Balance, ending his long-standing partnership with Nike.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, holders of maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a less favorable savings climate. Financial experts suggest exploring several options instead of automatically rolling over funds into a new, lower-rate CD. These alternatives include high-yield savings accounts, which offer competitive rates and greater flexibility, and money market accounts that combine high interest with checking features. Another strategy is to lock in current rates with a new long-term CD for extended security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a weaker-than-expected August employment report, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly to 6.29%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This 16-basis-point decline marks the largest one-day drop in over a year, providing potential relief for homebuyers facing high housing prices. The decrease could save a borrower purchasing a median-priced home approximately $169 per month, though it remains uncertain if this will be enough to reinvigorate mortgage demand.

The agency released images from the missions, including one showing a burning vessel that was intercepted in mid-August.

Scientists are using the opportunity to study the comet's composition and chemistry, hoping to understand how such objects change while passing through our solar system before it speeds back into interstellar space.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.8 billion, potential winners face a significant tax bill that will substantially reduce their take-home prize. The winner can choose between an annuity or a lump sum of approximately $826.4 million, but both options are subject to a mandatory 24% federal tax withholding upfront. Because the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a much larger tax payment will be due, in addition to any applicable state taxes.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta had sued the city, arguing the ban was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. In addition to repealing the ordinance, Norwalk will dedicate $250,000 toward new affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring of its housing policies, ending a standoff where city leaders had argued they were unfairly burdened with regional homelessness issues.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot grows to $1.8 billion, an analysis of lottery data reveals how a winner's location can significantly impact their net winnings. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to take home a larger portion of the jackpot after federal taxes are deducted. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceedingly slim at 1 in 292.2 million.
