          <p>The UK and India have finalized a 'landmark' trade deal after three years of negotiations, designed to ease exports for UK firms like whisky and car manufacturers, while also reducing taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a significant boost to growth, forecasting an additional ¬£25.5 billion in trade by 2040. The deal, celebrated by both nations, includes provisions for services and procurement, allowing British firms to compete for more contracts, and will eliminate social security payments for Indian employees on short-term visas. Once enacted, the trade deal is expected to lower tariffs on goods entering the UK from India, providing consumers with lower prices on certain items.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed budget cuts to NASA by the Trump administration are causing concerns for the European Space Agency (ESA) due to potential impacts on international collaborations, particularly the Artemis moon program. ESA Director General Josef Aschbacher emphasized the importance of cooperation in space activities and stated that the ESA will assess the repercussions of the budget changes. The proposed cuts, which could remove approximately $6 billion from NASA's budget, signal a potential shift in priorities from the moon to Mars, potentially favoring programs pushed by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) program and Orion Spacecraft crew capsule could be dropped by 2027, with SpaceX's Starship rocket program potentially replacing them.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an initial failed vote, the Bundestag elected Friedrich Merz as the new German chancellor in a second attempt. The first vote's failure was unprecedented, leading to discussions of a 'national crisis' within some commentaries, although CDU/CSU and SPD politicians are trying to downplay the dissent. Other parties, including the Greens, have declined to assist Merz in securing the chancellorship, asserting that the coalition partners must demonstrate their capacity to govern independently. The situation has created nervousness, with many avoiding questions about political responsibility and potential behind-the-scenes consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a significant surge driven by speculation of pressure from Washington for currency strengthening. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar is still up over 8% this year against the greenback, while the U.S. dollar index is down by the same year to date. Experts suggest the currency moves were driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt. While Taiwan's central bank Governor Yang Chin-long refuted claims that exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical, suggesting that currency rates may be part of broader trade discussions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts warn of the serious consequences of missing payments on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), including late fees, damaged credit scores, default risk, and potential foreclosure. With American homeowners holding near-record levels of home equity, many have opened HELOCs, making it crucial to understand the repercussions of missed payments. Missing payments can lead to late fees, significant drops in credit scores, and ultimately, foreclosure if the debt is not managed. Experts recommend homeowners contact their lenders immediately to explore options like deferred payments, modified payments, or forbearance to mitigate these risks. </p>

          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine can significantly lower the risk of cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The study, involving over 1 million people aged 50 or older, found a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events in vaccinated individuals. Dr. C√©line Gounder notes that the newer Shingrix vaccine may offer even better protection, suggesting a connection between infections and chronic diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already recommends the shingles vaccine for everyone starting at age 50.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a decline despite reporting earnings that met expectations and raising full-year revenue guidance. The artificial intelligence software company saw its shares fall about 9% after the bell. While the company's commercial revenues grew 71% and government segment sales jumped 45%, concerns over international growth are present. CEO Alex Karp attributed the growth to the adoption of its tools within the U.S. defense sector and increasing demand for large language models and supporting software.</p>

          <p>China's state broadcaster, CCTV, has provided a glimpse of the electromagnetic catapult system in action on the country's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian. The footage shows an unidentified aircraft hurtling along the deck, demonstrating the cutting-edge jet launch system. However, the report also suggested that the Fujian may require longer sea trials than China's other carriers, the Liaoning and Shandong, due to the complexity of the launch system. The adoption of the electromagnetic catapult system means that the Fujian's carrier-based aircraft would take off with full fuel and ordnance.</p>

Hegseth aims to drive innovation and operational excellence by removing unnecessary bureaucratic layers and streamlining leadership, with the cuts to be carried out 'expeditiously.'

          <p>Generations of deep-diving among women on Jeju Island in South Korea may have resulted in genetic adaptations, including lower blood pressure and enhanced cold-water tolerance. Known as Haenyeo, these 'sea women' have evolved to dive longer than other humans. Genomic analysis revealed distinctive traits, including bradycardia, a slow heart rate, and genetic mutations that protect against blood pressure changes during pregnancy. This cultural practice has led to genetic 'superpowers' that could help science develop new medical treatments in the future.</p>

Despite the positive results, Ferrari acknowledged a potential risk of 50 basis points reduction on profitability percentage margins due to the introduction of import tariffs on EU cars into the USA.
