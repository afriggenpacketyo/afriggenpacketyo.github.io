          <p>A 34-year-old Peruvian man residing in Nagahama, Shiga Prefecture, was arrested for allegedly driving his car in the wrong direction on the Shin-Meishin Expressway in Kameyama, Mie Prefecture. The man collided with two vehicles and is accused of failing to report the accident. The incident led to a pile-up involving four vehicles, resulting in minor injuries to four women. The man reportedly continued driving the wrong way for about 10 kilometers after the initial collision and police suspect he may have made an illegal U-turn on the expressway.</p>

The funds will primarily be used to construct a new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients such as Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen.

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, the lowest level in two years, citing receding inflation concerns. Australia's inflation rate recently hit a four-year low of 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025. The RBA aims to sustainably return inflation to its target range of 2-3%. Analysts, however, highlight potential downside risks to the Australian economy due to global trade tensions and domestic uncertainty.</p>

However, the limited scope and concessions required in these deals highlight Britain's diminished position post-Brexit. While the agreements offer benefits, such as reduced tariffs on British luxury cars and easier travel to the EU, they also involve trade-offs like allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters.

The move comes after entertainment giant Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with the program.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion in April, despite President Trump's ongoing tariff war, which stands in contrast to market concerns over soaring Treasury yields. Analysts attribute this trend to a weaker US dollar and China's economic recovery. The inflow highlights changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from US dollar assets since the trade war began. Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating has also contributed to this shift.</p>
