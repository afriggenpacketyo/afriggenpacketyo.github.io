          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard members from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after their controversial deployment. President Trump had federalized the troops to address protests against ICE activities, a move opposed by Governor Gavin Newsom. While the administration claims the withdrawal is due to subsiding lawlessness, Newsom is calling for the remaining forces to be sent home, stating they are being used as political pawns without a clear mission.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that seeks to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation is part of a broader Republican push to support the crypto industry and would allow banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Supporters argue it will enable faster, lower-cost payments, while critics point to risks such as the potential for depegging from their underlying asset.</p>

          <p>In an article published in the Communist Party's theoretical journal, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to economic globalization and free trade. He spoke out against rising unilateralism, protectionism, and the use of sanctions, positioning China as a champion of open markets. The article compiles statements made by Xi since 2012, emphasizing China's goal to promote trade and investment liberalization while opposing the building of economic walls and barriers, in a clear contrast to U.S. policies under President Trump.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments to use tailored legislation to foster economic and social development. Since 2015, more Chinese cities have been granted the power to draft local laws on issues like urban development and environmental protection. The piece highlights that creating a stable, rule-of-law-based system allows market entities to operate with confidence, shifting governance from top-down orders to a more structured legal framework to drive growth.</p>

          <p>In an unprecedented effort, marine scientists are crossbreeding Elkhorn coral from Honduras with local populations to restore Florida's dying reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral has been destroyed by warming oceans, disease, and coastal development. Scientists hope the resilient Honduran coral genes will create a hardier hybrid, nicknamed the "Flonduran," capable of surviving future marine heat waves. This project is a critical step in rebuilding the reef system, which is vital for protecting Florida's coastline from storm surges.</p>

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. The trend, highlighted by the World Gold Council, is driven by soaring gold prices and the desire to support domestic industry, though it requires careful management to ensure the gold meets international standards.

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be renamed "assistants" to prevent confusion with doctors. The review, prompted by safety concerns, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish their roles. It clarifies that associates should not be diagnosing patients, addressing a lack of clarity that arose as their numbers grew to fill gaps in medical posts without a clear national plan for their integration.</p>

A key goal of the ambitious makeover is to upgrade the heating system with heat pumps, which will reduce the building's carbon emissions to net zero while preserving the iconic Victorian structure for future generations.</p>

The watchdog found that the advert's language, which promoted ingredients like magnesium and L-theanine as having calming effects, was not compliant with regulations for marketing food and supplements. The ASA ruled that the advert implied the drink could treat or cure human disease, which is prohibited, and ordered it not to appear again in its current form.</p>

The case is re-examining whether his conviction in a military court, held under martial law, was just. The retrial forces a national re-evaluation of two polarizing figures and the country's turbulent path to democracy.</p>
