          <p>Asean faces a critical juncture amid US-China trade tensions, with opportunities to leverage its diplomatic position. The recent finalization of negotiations for an upgraded free-trade agreement with China aims to deepen economic integration through digital trade, green initiatives, and supply chain connectivity. Concurrently, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim seeks a US-Asean meeting with President Trump to address tariffs. Asean can capitalize on the US-China rivalry by fostering a neutral trade ecosystem that prioritizes regional resilience and strategic autonomy. This requires navigating internal divisions and external pressures with unprecedented cohesion to shape trade rules rather than merely adapting to them.</p>

          <p>With the football season concluded, a mini transfer window has opened ahead of the Club World Cup, allowing clubs to sign players before the main window reopens. This article examines the financial positions of Premier League clubs to determine their spending capacity, considering Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). PSR limits clubs to losses of ¬£105m over three years, with adjustments for time spent outside the top tier. The analysis, conducted with football finance expert Kieran Maguire, assesses which clubs have the financial flexibility to invest in their squads and which face PSR constraints. The report provides insight into the financial health of Premier League teams as they prepare for the upcoming season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that parents in Europe generally find their lives more meaningful compared to childfree individuals, but report lower levels of life satisfaction. This disparity is particularly pronounced for mothers, with their life satisfaction being more influenced by factors such as their living situation and family policies in their respective countries. Scandinavian countries show smaller differences in life satisfaction between parents and childfree individuals due to robust childcare, financial support, and parental leave policies, while greater gender equality also contributes to higher parental satisfaction. The research emphasizes that children are a societal responsibility, necessitating comprehensive support from policymakers to ensure both parental and societal wellbeing.</p>
