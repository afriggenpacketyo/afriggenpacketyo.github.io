        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that East Asian economies like Japan and South Korea can learn from China's approach to navigating trade pressures, particularly from the United States. While Japan and South Korea built their manufacturing prowess on homegrown technologies, China has evolved from an original equipment manufacturer to a leader in automation and robotics. The article suggests that China's robust supply chain and strategic shift towards high-tech sectors, such as electric vehicles, position it as a formidable global competitor. It frames regional cooperation as a key to sustaining technological innovation and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has identified Virginia as the top state for french fry consumption in the United States. Based on a poll of 5,000 adults, the average Virginian reports eating approximately 21 pounds of fries annually. Following closely are Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland, with residents consuming about 20 pounds per year. The research, commissioned by McCain Foods ahead of National French Fry Day, estimates that Americans collectively eat over 5.6 billion pounds of fries each year, highlighting the enduring popularity of this side dish across the nation.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often controversial cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. Remembered as a key architect of "Thatcherism," he was known for his staunch self-reliance philosophy and his role in implementing laws to curb trade union power. His political career was marked by his plain-spoken, uncompromising views and his personal courage, particularly after he and his wife were severely injured in the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton. Often depicted as a tough enforcer, he remained an influential voice on the right wing of the Conservative party long after leaving government.</p>

          <p>Teenage footballer Michelle Agyemang is making a significant impression for England at Euro 2025, despite limited playing time. The 19-year-old Arsenal forward, who scored just 41 seconds into her debut, has been hailed for her strength and ability to change a game's momentum. Coach Sarina Wiegman selected Agyemang as a wildcard, believing she could "bring something different" to the squad.

          <p>An early analysis of the NBA's free agency period highlights several teams making significant moves. The Atlanta Hawks and Houston Rockets are identified as major winners, with Atlanta acquiring key players like Kristaps Porzingis and Houston landing superstar Kevin Durant. The Denver Nuggets also receive praise for smart financial and roster decisions. Conversely, the New Orleans Pelicans are criticized for a questionable draft-day trade that surrendered a valuable future pick. The article also notes that despite the Lakers' front office stability, stars LeBron James and Luka Dončić face uncertainty with a roster that still has significant holes.</p>

          <p>Chinese research teams are making notable progress in the field of optical chips, which use light instead of electrons to transfer data and could be crucial for advancing artificial intelligence. As traditional electronic chips approach their physical limits, optical alternatives offer the potential for much greater speed and data capacity. Scientists have highlighted that recent Chinese developments demonstrate a significant increase in the number of light channels used for computation. This hardware innovation is seen as a key step in meeting the immense computing demands required for developing and training sophisticated AI models.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to outlaw the use of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) for silencing victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render such confidentiality clauses void, ensuring workers can speak out about illegal behavior without fear of legal reprisal. This move follows high-profile cases where NDAs were used to cover up criminality, such as accusations of sexual assault and abuse against the late Mohamed Al Fayed. Campaigners have hailed the change as a major step in preventing the misuse of NDAs to protect powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is putting forward a bill that would reintroduce a form of military conscription, allowing the government to call up citizens in a national defense situation. The plan, set to be in place by 2026, is a response to the changed security landscape in Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This proposal is a compromise, aiming to rapidly boost armed forces numbers if needed without fully restoring the compulsory military service that was suspended in 2011. The bill also includes incentives to make voluntary service more attractive to help Germany meet its new NATO troop commitments.</p>

          <p>Australia's central bank has unexpectedly decided to maintain its policy rate at 3.85%, contrary to economists' expectations of a 25-basis-point cut. The Reserve Bank of Australia stated it needs more time and information to confirm that inflation is sustainably on track to its 2.5% target. While recent monthly inflation data was generally in line with forecasts, the bank noted the figures were slightly stronger than anticipated. This decision comes as Australia navigates a growth slowdown, with officials weighing the need to stimulate the economy against the risk of resurgent inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for its third heatwave of the summer, which is forecast to be the most widespread and sustained one yet. High pressure is expected to build, bringing hot air from continental Europe and pushing temperatures to a peak of 33°C (91°F) in England over the weekend. Unlike previous heatwaves that were concentrated in the south and east, this event is likely to bring very warm or hot conditions to all four nations, including Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Some locations could experience a full week of temperatures that meet the official heatwave criteria.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has made an unexpected run to the Club World Cup semi-finals, where they will face Chelsea. The team's success is largely attributed to the leadership of veteran defender Thiago Silva and manager Renato Gaúcho. The 40-year-old Silva has been instrumental in the team's solid defensive performance, organizing the back line and providing crucial on-field guidance. The semi-final will be a special occasion for Silva, who won the Champions League and a previous Club World Cup with Chelsea, as he now leads his boyhood club against his former team in a high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels defeated the Texas Rangers 6-5 in a dramatic finish, with Nolan Schanuel drawing a bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the ninth inning to force in the winning run.

D'Arnaud later hit a crucial game-tying double in the sixth inning. The game ended in an unconventional fashion when Schanuel patiently took four balls with the bases loaded, securing a hard-fought victory for the Angels at home.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron is in the UK for a three-day state visit that combines royal ceremony with significant political discussions. High on the agenda for his talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer are the issues of stopping migrant crossings in the English Channel and advancing plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine. The visit is the first by an EU head of state since Brexit and is seen as a symbol of the UK's desire to reset its relationship with the bloc. Both leaders are seeking closer cooperation to disrupt smuggling gangs and manage the flow of asylum-seekers.</p>
