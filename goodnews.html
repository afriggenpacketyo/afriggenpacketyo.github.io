          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of the 1989 murders of their parents, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The resentencing comes after years of claims by the brothers that they acted in self-defense due to alleged abuse. Relatives expressed joy at the decision, with their cousin Annamaria Baralt stating she had been crying tears of joy all day. The decision was influenced by years of advocacy by the family to free the brothers, who were convicted of first-degree murder.</p>

He recalled a pivotal moment early in his career when Bryant insisted on a late-night gym session, teaching him the importance of consistent dedication.
