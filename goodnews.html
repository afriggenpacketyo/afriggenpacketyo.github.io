          <p>A spokesperson for former President Joe Biden has confirmed he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a common procedure to treat skin cancer. Biden was seen with a bandage on his head, prompting the announcement. This follows a previous procedure in February 2023 where a basal cell carcinoma was removed from his chest. His doctor stated at the time that all cancerous tissue was removed and that he would continue regular dermatologic surveillance as part of his ongoing healthcare.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, stated that enterprises are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. While acknowledging the consumer appeal of AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks like booking flights, he warned that their need for user credentials and autonomy is at odds with corporate security protocols. Arora emphasized that credential theft is a primary cause of security breaches, highlighting his company's planned acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk to address these vulnerabilities.</p>

The school is designed to create a direct pipeline for students to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which are predominantly located in the South. In partnership with Delaware State University (DSU), students can earn up to 64 college credits and an associate's degree, with guaranteed admission to DSU upon graduation.

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," a raw and unflinching account of her relationship with her formidable mother, Mary Roy. The book delves into their turbulent bond, describing her mother as both "my shelter and my storm." Roy reflects on how her upbringing with the mercurial feminist icon and educator shaped her as a writer, providing a "reportage of the heart" rather than a traditional hagiography. The memoir chronicles a life of survival, rebellion, and the complex legacy of a powerful maternal figure.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the AI image generator Midjourney, accusing the company of producing unauthorized replicas of its iconic characters like Batman and Superman. The suit alleges that Midjourney trained its AI models using the studio's copyrighted works without permission, constituting content theft. By taking this legal action, Warner Bros. joins a similar case brought by Disney and Universal, escalating the legal battle between major Hollywood studios and AI firms over the use of intellectual property. The entertainment giants are seeking damages and an injunction to protect their creative assets.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump hosted a meeting with top technology leaders, including the CEOs of Google and IBM, to launch a task force on integrating artificial intelligence into K-12 education. The event, part of the "Presidential AI Challenge," focused on preparing children for an AI-driven future, with Trump stating that "the robots are here." The initiative is part of a broader administration push to achieve global dominance in AI, though it has drawn criticism from watchdog groups concerned about the potential negative impacts of AI on youth mental health. Tech companies at the meeting pledged to expand AI education and skills training for millions of students and workers.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the high-profile trade of star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a strategic financial decision. Jones stated that the trade was "based on mathematics," not personal issues, emphasizing that the salary cap implications of Parsons' massive new contract were a key factor. He argued that the draft picks received in return would allow the team to pay for multiple top-tier players, improving overall team availability and depth. Parsons recently signed a four-year, $186 million extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be kept at or below 82 degrees. The proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. The measure aims to provide tenants with a safe living environment, though it faces opposition from landlord associations concerned about implementation costs.</p>

          <p>In her husband's second term, First Lady Melania Trump has adopted a more focused and influential public role, concentrating on issues at the intersection of technology and children's welfare. While she maintains a relatively private profile, she has been instrumental in initiatives like the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the posting of non-consensual intimate images, and a new task force on AI in education. Analysts note her approach is less about traditional maternal advocacy and more focused on the business and legislative aspects of protecting youth in the digital age. This selective but impactful engagement demonstrates a unique, business-oriented approach to the role of first lady.</p>

          <p>With home equity at high levels and interest rates potentially set to fall, homeowners may be considering tapping into their property's value. This article advises asking critical questions before taking out a home equity loan, especially with a potential Federal Reserve rate cut on the horizon. Homeowners should assess how much equity they can actually borrow, whether their financial needs are urgent enough to justify current rates, and if waiting for future rate cuts might be more beneficial. It also suggests comparing the fixed rates of a loan against the variable, and potentially volatile, rates of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to act strategically to lock in the current high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests that individuals with significant funds, such as $10,000, should consider their options before rates decline further. Key recommendations include assessing whether to deposit more money to maximize interest, shopping directly with online banks which typically offer higher rates, and acting quickly as banks may lower their rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. Taking these steps can help savers make the most of the current high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the club's ownership made the decision in a bid for greater sporting success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and the club won two trophies, but he was often a target of fan protests over a perceived lack of on-field achievement. The club's ownership, the Lewis family, will now implement a new leadership structure to guide Tottenham into a new era.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2025, offering some relief to prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since January, from over 7% to around 6.50%. This decline, while not returning rates to the historic lows of a few years ago, translates into lower monthly payments and significant savings over the life of a loan. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its key interest rate soon, there is potential for mortgage rates to fall even further. (not investment advice)</p>
