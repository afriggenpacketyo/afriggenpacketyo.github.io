        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has secured a deal to stream Sesame Street, providing its 300 million subscribers access to the 56th season and a substantial back catalog. This move comes after Warner Bros Discovery did not renew its deal with the show, creating uncertainty about its future. PBS will retain access to episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix, ensuring continued availability on free-to-air television. Sesame Street has been a cornerstone of children's media since 1969, addressing issues like child obesity and music education, with appearances from figures like Michelle Obama and Elmo in public policy discussions.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump over 11% in their Hong Kong trading debut. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite facing trade tensions and a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year over year, driven by strong demand for electric vehicles in China.</p>

          <p>Associates of President Trump are actively returning to the market for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), focusing on cryptocurrency and blockchain companies. Key executives from Trump Media & Technology Group are involved in pitching new SPAC deals. Brandon Lutnick, son of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, is leading Cantor Fitzgerald's efforts in the SPAC market, with recent deals involving crypto company Tether and SoftBank. SPACs are inherently speculative, allowing companies to raise money without a business plan, and their resurgence depends on investors' appetite for risky bets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>William Goodge, a British ultra-endurance athlete, broke the world record for running across Australia, completing the 3,800km journey in 35 days. He ran the equivalent of two-and-a-half marathons (about 100km) every day, starting from Cottesloe Beach in Perth and finishing at Bondi Beach. Goodge began running marathons after his mother's death from cancer in 2018, and this journey raised money for cancer charities in the UK, US, and Australia. He dedicated the run to his late mother and credited her memory for helping him overcome the challenges during the journey.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, reducing the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%. The cuts are part of a package of stimulus measures aimed at boosting the economy amid trade tensions. The rate reductions followed moves by state-backed commercial lenders to reduce their deposit rates, protecting their net interest margin. Despite deflationary pressures and elevated tariffs, some investment banks have raised their forecasts for China's economic growth, anticipating additional stimulus measures.</p>

          <p>Fiber plays a crucial role in supporting overall health, particularly for individuals with diabetes, by helping regulate blood sugar levels. Chickpeas, chia seeds, edamame, raspberries, and avocados are highlighted as top high-fiber foods that can help manage blood sugar. These foods slow the digestion and absorption of glucose, preventing sharp spikes and crashes in blood sugar. Increasing fiber intake should be a slow and steady endeavor to minimize digestive symptoms, and these additions can be easily incorporated into a balanced diet.</p>
