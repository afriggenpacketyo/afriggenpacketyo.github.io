          <p>China's trade data for July revealed stronger-than-anticipated performance, with exports growing by 7.2% in U.S. dollar terms compared to the previous year, exceeding economists' forecasts. This growth occurs amid an ongoing tariff truce with the United States. In a significant rebound, imports also saw their largest increase in a year, rising 4.1% and marking the first monthly import growth this year. The positive figures for both exports and imports suggest some resilience in China's trade sector despite global economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated return to the Hollywood Bowl for a performance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, marking the 20th anniversary of his U.S. debut. The concert featured a savvy program blending the music of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, with pianist Seong-Jin Cho as the soloist. The review praises the orchestra's ability to "swing" through the Ellington pieces, a rare feat for a classical ensemble. The homecoming was also bittersweet, as Dudamel's upcoming performances with the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela were canceled due to travel issues.</p>

          <p>Apple has announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move that comes as the company navigates President Trump's threats of steep tariffs on foreign-made goods. The commitment, celebrated by Trump at the White House, is seen as an effort by Apple to avoid increased costs on its international supply chain, which relies heavily on China for final assembly. While CEO Tim Cook stated that final assembly would remain overseas for now, the new investment focuses on bringing more component manufacturing and suppliers to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from harm. Under the new proposals, high-risk procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) could only be performed by qualified health professionals. Additionally, clinics offering treatments like Botox and dermal fillers will need to obtain a license by meeting strict standards for safety, training, and insurance. The move, which follows years of concern over the lack of regulation, has been welcomed by industry safety campaigners.</p>
