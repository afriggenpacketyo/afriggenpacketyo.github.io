          <p>The FDA has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials demonstrated a 99.9% effectiveness rate among participants, marking a significant advancement in the fight against HIV. Gilead's CEO hailed the approval as a pivotal moment, potentially ending the HIV epidemic. However, experts warn that the Trump administration's recent funding cuts to HIV vaccine research could hinder long-term progress, emphasizing the continued need for vaccine development despite this breakthrough. This decision may have lasting consequences for HIV vaccine research, potentially setting back efforts by a decade. </p>
