          <p>Tottenham Hotspur captain Son Heung-min has announced his departure from the club this summer, concluding a successful 10-year career where he scored 173 goals in 454 appearances. The South Korea international, who led Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League final in May, described the decision as the most difficult of his career. Son, 33, is reportedly in advanced negotiations with Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC. His former coach, Thomas Frank, lauded him as a "true Spurs legend" and one of the Premier League's greatest players.</p>

Badenoch, who returned to the UK at 16 due to Nigeria's political and economic climate, stated she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s. She explained that her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political outlook and that she has not experienced meaningful racial prejudice in the UK, often defending the country against such accusations. Her comments previously drew criticism from Nigeria's vice-president.</p>

          <p>Cambodia announced its intention to nominate former President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, crediting his direct involvement with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol expressed gratitude for Trump's efforts in ending the conflict, which had killed 43 people and displaced over 300,000. Trump had threatened to halt trade with both nations until fighting ceased, leading to a negotiated truce in Malaysia. This nomination follows similar proposals from Israeli and Pakistani officials for Trump's peace efforts in other regions.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Uncover Tomato Ancestor's Role in Potato Evolution</h2>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has uncovered an ancient genetic link between the tomato and potato, tracing the potato's evolution back approximately nine million years. Their study, published in Cell, reveals that a tomato ancestor hybridized with tuberless, potato-like plants called etuberosum, leading to the development of tubers. This groundbreaking discovery sheds light on how the potato, the world's third most consumed food crop, acquired its defining characteristic and diversified into the staple it is today. The research suggests hybridisation was a key driver in the formation of this crucial trait.</p>

          <p>LAFC secured a 4-2 penalty shootout victory against Pachuca after a 1-1 draw at home in the Leagues Cup 2025, but the result effectively eliminates them from the tournament. Despite playing with 10 men for a significant portion of the match after Nathan Ordaz received a red card, LAFC's coach Cherundolo praised the team's performance and winning mentality. Dennis Bouanga scored for LAFC, while Elías Montiel equalized for Pachuca. The team's two points from two matches are insufficient for advancement in the competitive 18-team MLS group.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's temporary order blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in Southern California. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel affirmed that reasonable suspicion for detention cannot be based solely on factors like apparent race, ethnicity, language, location, or occupation. This ruling is a significant setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, which had led to widespread fear and chaotic public arrests in the region. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass celebrated the decision as a victory for constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>Thousands of hot dogs spilled across a busy highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, after a truck experienced a mechanical problem, ripping its trailer open. The incident created a "wurst Fry-day commute" for motorists, with crews working to clear the scattered sausages. Fire Company Chief Brad Dauberman noted the surprising slipperiness of hot dogs, which complicated cleanup efforts. A front-end loader was deployed to scoop up the wieners, all deemed garbage once they hit the road, highlighting an unusual traffic disruption.</p>

          <p>Researchers have traced a recent spike in summer flooding in North China to variations in solar cycle activities, according to a study published in the Journal of Climate. The team identified the influence of changes in the solar magnetic cycle on China's decadal summer precipitation pattern, characterized by "south drought and north flooding." This discovery highlights how solar activity can significantly impact the positioning of the monsoon rain belt, a crucial factor for climate predictions during flood seasons. Understanding this link could improve future flood forecasting.</p>
