          <p>NATO is strengthening its engagement with the commercial space sector, backed by a new strategy and a pledge from member nations to significantly increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035.

This strategic shift is creating opportunities for defense and space companies, highlighted by a recent intelligence contract awarded to Planet Labs.

          <p>China's city of Chongqing is experiencing a massive surge in tourism from Southeast Asia, largely fueled by viral social media clips showcasing its unique, futuristic architecture. Flight bookings to the city have increased more than sixfold, with travelers drawn to its "cyberpunk" landscape, where monorails pass through residential buildings and structures are built into mountainous terrain. Travel platforms like Klook report a nearly twelve-fold increase in demand for Chongqing compared to other Chinese cities.

Investor sentiment was also bolstered by gains in the U.S. tech sector, particularly among semiconductor stocks, due to optimism about demand for artificial intelligence.

This provides a degree of temporary relief for countries like Japan, which has been in ongoing talks to secure concessions on higher U.S. tariffs, particularly those affecting its automotive industry.
