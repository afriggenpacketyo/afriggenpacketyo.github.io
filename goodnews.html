        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump defended the White House's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating the U.S. has aided Qatar significantly in the past. Trump dismissed concerns about the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments, saying it would be foolish not to accept the gesture. Critics, including Democrats and some of Trump's supporters, have raised legal and ethical questions, while the White House insists any gift will comply with applicable laws. The plane, a Boeing 747-8, would need retrofitting and security clearance before use, as Boeing is behind schedule in directly providing the White House with two new 747-8s. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments and announced new funding for treatment and housing, asserting that there are no more excuses for inaction. Newsom emphasized the need for cities and counties to do their part, providing resources to address encampments and offer alternatives. The model ordinance requires policies to prioritize shelter and services, not criminalize sleeping outside when no alternatives exist, and allow local authorities to clear encampments. Newsom highlighted the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances and a 2024 executive order as justification for cities to act, supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent art auction at Christie's in New York revealed signs of economic uncertainty affecting the art market, with presold items and quiet bidding. The auction of the Riggio family collection, built on the Barnes & Noble fortune, saw lackluster bidding, attributed to concerns over President Trump's tariffs. While the collection totaled $272 million with fees, it fell short of presale expectations. A Mondrian painting, once displayed in Leonard Riggio's apartment, sold for $47.6 million, below the previous record for a Mondrian. The 20th Century Evening Sale fared slightly better, but the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market.</p>

          <p>Sussan Ley has been named the first female leader of Australia's Liberal Party, succeeding Peter Dutton after the party's historic election loss. Ley, from the moderate faction, defeated Angus Taylor, who promised to restore conservative values. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, emphasizing the need to respect and represent modern Australia. The junior coalition partner, the Nationals, re-elected David Littleproud as leader, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's new cabinet has been sworn in.</p>

President Bola Tinubu's government implemented economic reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira currency. However, the reforms have led to a cost-of-living crisis for many Nigerians, with nearly half living in poverty. Inflation is expected to remain high at an average of 22.1%, and the agricultural sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs.</p>

After being elected to Congress, he made several trips back to Vietnam and was appointed ambassador in 1997. As ambassador, Peterson oversaw a key trade agreement and started the "Safe Vietnam" program to improve safety awareness, including mandatory helmet use for motorbike riders.

Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking a safe haven asset outside the banking system. However, while gold is considered a stable asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, and major surges have been followed by significant falls. Experts are divided on whether the upward trend will continue, with some forecasting further increases and others warning of a potential market bubble.

          <p>The focus on weight alone when considering weight-loss drugs is misplaced; changes in health should be the primary goal, not just changes in weight. GLP-1 drugs can reduce visceral fat, improving metabolic health. The strongest case for GLP-1s is in people with excess visceral fat who have begun to suffer its consequences. BMI is a poor measure, but waist size is a good predictor of visceral fat, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis. GLP-1 drugs were approved under the premise that patients will stay on them for life, but so far, most people take them for less than a year, and scientists do not have good data on how to get off the drugs without regaining weight.</p>

          <h2>Episcopal Church Refuses to Resettle White South Africans Granted Refugee Status</h2>

          <p>The Episcopal church‚Äôs migration service is refusing a directive from the federal government to help resettle white South Africans granted refugee status, citing the church‚Äôs longstanding ‚Äúcommitment to racial justice and reconciliation‚Äù. Presiding bishop Sean Rowe announced the step on Monday, shortly before 59 South Africans arrived at Dulles international airport outside Washington DC on a private charter plane and were greeted by a government delegation. Donald Trump opened a fast-tracked refugee status to white South Africans, accusing their government of discrimination, even as his administration abruptly shut down the overall US refugee program. The move marks the end of a ministry-government partnership that, for nearly four decades, has served nearly 110,000 refugees from countries, including Ukraine, Myanmar and Congo, Rowe said.</p>
