        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the challenging path of Akash Deep to becoming a celebrated Indian Test cricketer. Hailing from a small village in Bihar, he overcame significant personal tragedy, including the deaths of his father and brother, which forced him to temporarily abandon the sport to support his family. With the persistent help of a childhood friend, he relocated to Bengal, where his raw talent for fast bowling was eventually recognized. His story is one of resilience, from being underestimated to earning an IPL contract and ultimately dedicating his international success to his sister, who was battling cancer.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a multi-billion-euro initiative to build "AI gigafactories" in an effort to catch up with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence. These facilities are designed to be one-stop shops that bring together high-performance computing, data, and researchers to develop advanced AI models. The EU has committed an initial 20 billion euros and has received significant interest from member states. However, the plan faces major challenges, including securing massive private investment and addressing the immense power consumption required for such large-scale data centers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volunteer crew members for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their role in rescuing migrants in the English Channel, stating their mission is purely humanitarian. Facing accusations of acting as a "taxi service," the crew emphasizes their duty is to save anyone in distress at sea, regardless of politics. The article shares harrowing accounts from volunteers, including the rescue of 19 people from a capsized dinghy and the emotional impact of these operations. The RNLI maintains that these call-outs are a small fraction of their work but are driven by a fundamental compassion for human life.</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S. market, overtaking China for the first time, according to research from Canalys. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones accounted for 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year. This significant shift is primarily driven by Apple's strategy to move its manufacturing supply chain away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. While this marks a major change in global manufacturing, the article notes that Apple still relies on China's mature infrastructure for its premium models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has encouraged his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, to pursue an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." In their first official phone call, Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable relationship, urging Seoul to deepen pragmatic cooperation with Beijing. The call is seen as an effort by China to reset relations with South Korea's new administration, which is viewed as more open to dialogue with Beijing than its predecessor. Both sides reportedly affirmed a commitment to advancing their strategic partnership in a mature manner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy program to encourage more births, offering parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under three. This policy aims to alleviate the financial burden of raising children for approximately 20 million families as the country confronts a severe demographic crisis. The move follows various local initiatives and comes as official data shows China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024. The country is one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child, a key factor in its declining birth rate.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed a new order for 300,000 H20 chipsets from manufacturer TSMC, reversing its earlier indication that it would rely on existing stock to supply the Chinese market. The H20 chip was specifically designed for China to comply with U.S. export restrictions, and the new order signals robust demand despite its reduced power. This move comes after the Trump administration allowed sales of the H20 to resume, a decision that has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers concerned about China gaining access to advanced AI technology.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent visit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided significant, direct access to the American leader, which Downing Street views as invaluable. However, the article notes the inherent risks of engaging with Trump's free-wheeling and unpredictable diplomatic style. The discussions covered a wide range of topics, including Gaza, with Starmer carefully interjecting to clarify UK policy. The analysis suggests that while the relationship is solid, its ultimate benefit for the UK depends on translating this personal access into tangible diplomatic outcomes.</p>
