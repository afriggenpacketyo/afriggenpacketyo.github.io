          <p>S&P Global Ratings has reaffirmed the AA+ credit rating for the United States, maintaining a stable outlook. The agency stated that increased revenue from the Trump administration's tariffs is expected to offset the fiscal impact of recent tax cuts. Despite signs of an economic slowdown and a weak July jobs report, S&P highlighted the resilience of the U.S. economy and its strong growth compared to peer nations since the pandemic. This assessment contrasts with a recent downgrade from Moody's, which cited concerns over national debt and trade policy uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Wen, who had been living in the U.S. illegally after his student visa expired, pleaded guilty to acting as an illegal agent for a foreign government. According to the Department of Justice, North Korean officials wired him approximately $2 million to procure the goods, which he concealed in shipping containers falsely labeled as consumer products.

          <p>For the first time, the San Gabriel Band of Mission Indians has regained a piece of its ancestral land after a Presbyterian church transferred the deed to a half-acre property in San Gabriel for $0. The land, which includes a community center, is located near the historic Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, where the tribe's ancestors were forced into labor centuries ago. As a state-recognized but not federally-recognized tribe, this land return is a landmark achievement, providing a permanent space for cultural ceremonies and community services. The move is seen as a significant step toward healing and rectifying historical injustices.</p>

The announcement came as NATO military leaders planned a video conference to discuss the security situation. Trump mentioned that European allies like France and Germany are willing to commit their own troops. He also revealed that he spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Putin he would help set up a direct meeting between the two leaders.</p>

Investors looked past the slight misses, focusing instead on strong momentum heading into the second half of the year and the company's reaffirmation of its full-year guidance. Management noted that same-store sales improved each month during the quarter, a trend that has continued into August. The positive market reaction is also attributed to anticipation of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, which could stimulate the housing market and benefit Home Depot's business.

          <p>A Southern California family, feeling the absence of active grandparents in their twin boys' lives, found a solution through the "Surrogate Grandparents USA" Facebook group. They connected with Janet Firestein Daw, a woman who longed for grandchildren but whose own children did not plan to have any. Over the past two years, "Nana J" has become an integral part of the Turner family, sharing holidays, trips, and daily activities with the boys. The story highlights a growing trend of forming unconventional family structures to create the "village" of support that many modern families lack, fostering meaningful intergenerational relationships.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in exchange for funds from the CHIPS Act. This marks a shift from the Biden administration's grant-based approach, with Lutnick stating the Trump administration wants "a piece of the action" for the American people. The news follows reports that the White House was considering a 10% stake and a recent $2 billion investment in Intel by SoftBank. The policy aims to ensure taxpayers benefit from federal investments intended to reshore semiconductor manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The PGA Tour is set to return to a Donald Trump-owned golf course for the first time in a decade, announcing the new Miami Championship will be held at Trump National Doral in May 2026. The prestigious "Blue Monster" course was a longtime Tour venue until the WGC-Cadillac Championship was moved to Mexico City in 2016 following Trump's controversial remarks during his first presidential campaign. At the time, the Tour cited sponsorship issues, not politics, for the move. In the interim, Doral became a key location for the rival LIV Golf series, making its return to the PGA Tour calendar a notable development.</p>

Unlike savings accounts with variable rates, CDs lock in an interest rate for the entire term, providing predictability and security.

          <p>In this opinion piece, the author reflects on his experience as a civilian professor at the U.S. Naval War College to argue against the anti-intellectual stance of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He contends that civilian academics play a crucial role in teaching strategy and critical thinking to senior military officers, preparing them for the complex political realities of warfare. By studying history and theory, from the Peloponnesian War to modern conflicts, officers learn to align military means with political ends. The author warns that severing this vital link between "the book and the sword" would be a grave error that guarantees calamity.</p>

          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is transforming education, with teachers exploring its potential as both a powerful tool and a significant challenge. While some educators use AI to save time on lesson planning and teach students about its capabilities and limitations, critics worry about cheating and a decline in critical thinking skills. In response, major tech companies like Microsoft and OpenAI have partnered with the American Federation of Teachers to train educators on AI use. This article examines the ongoing debate as school districts across the country shift from banning AI to developing policies for its responsible integration into learning.</p>

          <p>Air Canada announced it will gradually restart its operations after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that began over the weekend. The labor disruption had affected an estimated 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is guaranteed pay for work performed while aircraft are on the ground.
