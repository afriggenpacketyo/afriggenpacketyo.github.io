          <p>Ginzan Onsen, a popular hot spring town in Japan known for its resemblance to scenes from 'Spirited Away,' is implementing visitor restrictions to combat overtourism and preserve its cultural heritage. The town, which attracts 25 times its population in tourists annually, faced challenges like congestion and littering. Measures include shuttle buses and timed entry to limit hourly visitors, aiming to maintain the town's serene atmosphere and protect its traditional architecture from the Taisho period. Initial surveys show improved congestion and visitor support for the restrictions.</p>

          <p>China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) has deployed inspection teams to investigate lower-level officials, a practice that has intensified under President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. These inspections, known as xunshi, have led to the downfall of numerous officials, causing anxiety among those in power. The CCDI now largely generates its own leads rather than relying on public tip-offs, increasing the pressure on officials to maintain ethical conduct. The latest round of inspections includes investigations in provinces like Shanxi, demonstrating the ongoing commitment to combating corruption.</p>

          <p>Robert Harris, author of the novel "Conclave", suggests that the papal selection process shares similarities with the hit TV show "The Traitors". Harris, whose book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film, explains that the dynamic of cardinals trying to identify the right leader is similar to the show's premise of "faithful" contestants trying to identify the "traitors" among them. He also argues that political parties should learn from the conclave's secretive ritual, believing it's a "rather brilliant device" for finding the right person to lead an organization.</p>
