          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. As part of the plea agreement, he admitted to running a major fentanyl trafficking operation for the Sinaloa cartel's "Los Chapitos" faction. In exchange for his plea and an agreement to forfeit $80 million, Guzman Lopez may receive a sentence less than life in prison, contingent upon his substantial cooperation with federal authorities. This cooperation could involve providing critical information about his family's cartel operations, potentially including testimony against his own brother.</p>

          <p>UFC President Dana White has indicated that recently retired fighters Jon Jones and Conor McGregor could make a comeback for a potential UFC event at the White House. The unprecedented event was proposed by President Donald Trump to celebrate the nation's 250th birthday next year. White stated that Jones has already re-entered the drug-testing pool, a necessary step for returning to competition, and floated a 'dream main event' between Jones and heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall. He also suggested that McGregor, one of the sport's biggest stars, could potentially fight on the same high-profile card.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 16:15:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price soared to a new record high, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion, which propelled the digital currency to its best week since April. The rally was also supported by a wave of short liquidations and investor expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. Ether also experienced a significant surge, rising above the $3,000 mark for the first time since February. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pace bowler Jofra Archer made a stunning return to Test cricket for England after a 1,596-day absence due to injury, immediately making an impact against India at Lord's. In his first over, Archer dismissed star batsman Yashasvi Jaiswal with a 90mph delivery, showcasing the formidable speed and hostility that England's attack has been missing. His initial five-over spell was the third-fastest opening burst on record by an England bowler, reigniting hopes for his long-term role in the team. While questions about his ability to sustain this intensity remain, his performance demonstrated his unique X-factor and potential to reshape the series.</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media giant knowingly uses manipulative and addictive design features to exploit its younger users, putting them at risk for mental harm. The judge ruled that the state's claims were specific enough and focused on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is part of a broader trend of legal challenges by state attorneys general targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms concerning children.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after a decisive straight-sets victory over seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. Sinner dominated the match, winning 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, and preventing Djokovic from reaching a record 25th Grand Slam title. The 38-year-old Djokovic acknowledged that age and physical wear were factors in his defeat against the younger, sharper Italian. The result sets up a highly anticipated final between Sinner and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, a rematch of their recent five-set epic at the French Open, continuing the duo's recent dominance at major tournaments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal projectiles on journalists covering protests. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations following incidents where reporters were injured while covering demonstrations against the Trump administration's immigration policies. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera's order bars police from using such munitions against journalists who do not pose an imminent threat. The decision was praised by free press advocates as a necessary step to protect 1st Amendment rights and hold the department accountable.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, such as business and first class, mirroring the strategy it applied to its main economy cabin. The airline, which pioneered fare types like basic economy, sees an opportunity to offer more varied products to high-end customers, whose demand has remained strong. Delta President Glen Hauenstein suggested the template of main cabin segmentation could be applied to premium offerings, potentially creating different tiers of service and amenities. While no specific changes have been announced, the move aims to capitalize on the growing revenue from premium seats, which rose 6% in the first half of the year.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo aircraft was unexpectedly spotted flying over Kyiv before landing in Leipzig, Germany, sparking widespread surprise as Ukrainian airspace has been closed to most non-combat flights since 2022. The jet, operated by Antonov Airlines, had likely been stranded at the Svyatoshino airport in Kyiv since the beginning of the full-scale invasion. Its successful departure is seen as a sign of Ukrainian resilience and a potential intelligence failure by Russia, which was unable to detect or intercept the large aircraft. Regenerating the An-124 for cargo operations would provide a significant revenue source for Ukraine's war effort.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department reported an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion for June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a significant surge in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, following the implementation of broad new tariffs by the Trump administration. This monthly surplus helped narrow the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, though it remains 5% higher than the same period last year. Despite the boost from tariffs, net interest payments on the national debt continue to be a major expense, totaling $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid growing concerns about the long-term solvency of Social Security, retirees are exploring alternative methods to supplement their income. This article outlines three potential financial strategies for homeowners aged 62 and older. These include reverse mortgages, which convert home equity into monthly payments, and annuities, which provide a guaranteed income stream for life in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A third option discussed is using personal loans to create a financial buffer, though this involves taking on new debt. (not investment advice)</p>

This article suggests strategies such as working with fully online lenders, which use digital platforms to streamline applications, or choosing a no-documentation HELOC to minimize paperwork. Applying with the lender that already holds your primary mortgage can also be faster, as they have existing financial data. Additionally, opting for lenders that use automated or desktop appraisals can shave significant time off the process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The current season of the reality show 'Love Island USA' is being interpreted as a reflection of Gen Z's cautious and emotionally guarded approach to romance. Despite its popularity, viewers have noted a lack of deep connections, with contestants often engaging in 'situationships' rather than committed relationships. The article suggests this mirrors a generation that has less real-world dating experience and a greater anxiety about vulnerability, possibly shaped by growing up with social media and the pandemic. The show's most popular contestants are those who defy this trend, showing open enthusiasm and emotional vulnerability, resonating with a wide audience.</p>
