          <p>A child life specialist and therapist outlines six daily practices for parents to foster trust and communication with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, modeling emotional expression instead of interrogating, incorporating real talk into routines, and teaching coping strategies. The author emphasizes that trust is built in small, consistent moments, creating a safe space for children to share their emotions and experiences. By modeling vulnerability and emotional awareness, parents can encourage their children to open up and develop healthy communication habits.</p>

          <p>An anthropologist recounts travels across the United States, exploring the deep cultural rifts and potential for connection. Encounters range from a gated community emphasizing self-defense to a white nationalist rally fueled by xenophobia.

The piece emphasizes that overcoming division requires addressing the sense of estrangement and fostering a more expansive vision of community.</p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, emphasizing "shared humanity" and global unity, has gained widespread attention, particularly in light of the Trump administration's intensified scrutiny of Chinese students' visas. Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker, delivered her address on the same day a judge blocked an order preventing Harvard from enrolling international students. This comes amid escalating US-China tensions and concerns about espionage, with the US State Department planning to "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that allows humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses enable recognition of patterns and signals in the dark and even work better with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations, although some critics believe that existing night vision devices are more effective.</p>
