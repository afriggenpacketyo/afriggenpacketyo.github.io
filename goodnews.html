          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard announced the release of approximately 60,000 files related to the 1968 assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, adding to the 10,000 files released the previous month. Gabbard stated that the newly released investigative materials corroborate previously released information, including rumors circulating on foreign soil that Senator Kennedy had been shot one month prior to his actual assassination. The files, which had been stored in various federal government facilities for decades, include interviews with Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin, and eyewitness accounts. Additional files will continue to be uploaded to archives.gov/rfk for public access, with redactions for sensitive information.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Steady Amid Trump's Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs as policymakers assess the economic impact of his trade policies. The Fed cited rising economic risks and concerns that Trump's tariffs could spur higher inflation and unemployment. Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized the uncertainty surrounding the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, leading the central bank to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The decision reflects concerns about a potential stagflation scenario, where inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike, requiring the Fed to prioritize one aspect of its dual mandate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly stated that Canada has been "over reliant on the US for too long" and aims to forge closer ties with the UK, EU, and other nations. This shift comes amid tense US-Canada relations due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Canadian industries. Joly emphasized the importance of asserting Canada's sovereignty while seeking a new trade and security partnership with the US. Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump to discuss a fresh start for the US-Canada relationship, but Trump did not commit to removing the tariffs. Canada plans to host the G7 summit in June, which Trump is expected to attend, and King Charles III is scheduled to open Canada's parliament.</p>

          <p>Part of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482 is anticipated to crash back to Earth after remaining in orbit for over half a century. Launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, the spacecraft never escaped low Earth orbit and subsequently broke into four pieces. One of these pieces, thought to be the lander probe, is projected to re-enter the atmosphere around May 10, with the possibility that some components may endure the journey without completely burning up. Despite the uncertainty regarding its landing location, experts suggest that the risk to individuals on the ground is minimal, considering that 70% of the planet's surface is covered by water.</p>
