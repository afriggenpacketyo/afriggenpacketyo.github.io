          <p>Canada has resumed trade talks with the United States after rescinding its planned Digital Services Tax, which was set to target large U.S. technology firms. The move came after President Trump suspended negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack." Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump spoke on Sunday, agreeing to restart negotiations towards a July 21 deadline. The 3% tax would have applied retroactively to companies like Amazon and Google, and its cancellation is seen by some analysts as a significant concession. (not investment advice)</p>

The company has sued AI startup Anthropic for alleged unlawful data scraping, arguing for fair compensation for the commercial use of its data. Simultaneously, Reddit is leveraging AI for its own services, like the 'Reddit Answers' chatbot, to provide users with information sourced directly from its community discussions. This dual strategy aims to protect its core asset while adapting to the new technological landscape.</p>

          <p>Cancer survivors and patient advocates advise that providing effective support to a friend with cancer involves presence, listening, and making specific offers of help. Common mistakes include offering unsolicited advice, sharing stories of others who died from cancer, or disappearing out of fear of saying the wrong thing. Instead, experts recommend simply reaching out, asking if the person wants to talk, and then listening without judgment. Offering practical, specific help, like bringing a particular meal on a certain day, is more useful than a vague offer and helps combat the social isolation many patients experience.</p>

          <p>Homicide rates are falling significantly across the United States, with some analyses showing a drop of at least 14% in 2024. Researchers suggest a primary driver for both the initial spike in violence and its subsequent decline is the COVID-19 pandemic. The disruption of public services, schools, and community centers during the pandemic has been linked to the crime surge, while their recent restoration is credited with helping to lower violence. As local government employment and spending return to pre-pandemic levels, vital support systems for at-risk youth are being re-established, contributing to safer communities.</p>

After being accused of cultural appropriation for not crediting the design's origins, Prada stated it is now in contact with an Indian trade body.

          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has set his sights on winning the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat achieved by only a few wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old, who is sumo's 75th yokozuna, is the first new Japanese-born grand champion since 2017. His rapid rise to the sport's highest rank after just 13 tournaments has generated significant attention. Onosato hopes a strong performance in Nagoya will bring energy to his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was heavily impacted by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.</p>

          <p>A field of 288 golfers, including LIV tour members Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, and Graeme McDowell, are competing in final qualifying events across the UK for just 20 spots at The 153rd Open Championship. An intriguing storyline sees Poulter competing against his own son, Luke, at the same qualifying venue in Kent. For McDowell, qualifying would mean a chance to play another Open in his hometown of Royal Portrush. The high-stakes, 36-hole events represent the last chance for many to earn a place in golf's oldest major.</p>
