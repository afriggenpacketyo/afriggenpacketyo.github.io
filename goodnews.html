          <p>Actor Matthew McConaughey is sharing insights from his 13-year marriage to Camila Alves, suggesting a simple change can improve a couple's connection. In his new book, "Poems & Prayers," he humorously advises couples to switch from a king-size to a queen-size bed to foster physical closeness. McConaughey emphasizes that maintaining the couple's bond is crucial, as it sets a powerful example for their children on how to conduct healthy relationships. He believes that prioritizing time as a couple, separate from their roles as parents, is essential for a strong family foundation.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will remain over open waters for several days and is not currently a threat to land. Gabrielle is expected to strengthen, likely reaching hurricane status by Sunday as it tracks northwest. While its current path keeps it north of the Caribbean, the storm could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island. The season has so far been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA.</p>

          <p>For over a decade, Robert Fortunato's remodeled home in Hermosa Beach, California, has produced more energy than it consumes, demonstrating the feasibility of sustainable living. The "Green Idea House" utilizes 26 rooftop solar panels, an all-electric appliance setup, and passive design elements like strategic roof overhangs and a "thermal chimney" for cooling. Fortunato emphasizes that achieving this required extensive research, meticulous planning, and persistence with contractors to adhere to the eco-friendly vision. As climate change accelerates, he has had to make updates, but hopes his experience encourages others to adopt similar energy-saving principles in their own homes.</p>

          <p>Legendary pitcher Clayton Kershaw has announced his retirement at the end of the season, concluding an 18-year career spent entirely with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Kershaw is celebrated not only for his on-field dominance, including three Cy Young Awards, but also for being the cornerstone of the franchise's revival. He served as a beacon of excellence during the team's tumultuous years under previous ownership, including a bankruptcy period. His career bridged the gap from a 20-year postseason series drought to the current era of sustained success, making him a pivotal figure in modern Dodgers history.</p>

          <p>A wave of intense, youth-led protests against government corruption and unemployment has led to a dramatic political upheaval in Nepal. After violent clashes between police and demonstrators resulted in dozens of deaths, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Oli resigned. In his place, Nepal's first female chief justice, 73-year-old Sushila Karki, has been appointed as the nation's first female prime minister, a choice supported by activists in online polls. The movement, largely organized by Gen Z activists using social media to expose the lavish lifestyles of political elites, reflects a broader trend of generational change and unrest across South Asia.</p>

          <p>In the Democratic Republic of Congo, edible insects like caterpillars (Mbinzo) and palm weevil larvae (Mpose) are integral to the local cuisine, valued as both a delicacy and a vital source of protein. Harvested from forests or raised commercially, these insects are sold in bustling markets in Kinshasa and are often considered a more accessible and nutritious alternative to expensive meat. The practice has grown in recent decades, partly due to economic hardship and the scarcity of traditional bushmeat. Organizations are now promoting insect farming to improve food security and provide sustainable nutrition for vulnerable populations like orphans.</p>

          <p>Renowned television producer David E. Kelley is reaffirming his commitment to filming in California, keeping all of his current and upcoming projects based in the Los Angeles area. Despite industry trends of relocating productions to cheaper locations and recent challenges like devastating wildfires, Kelley's company has decided to double down on its local presence. This decision was bolstered by an enhanced state film and television tax credit program, which aims to keep Hollywood jobs in California. By choosing to stay, Kelley aims to support the local industry and community that have been central to his long and successful career.</p>

          <h2>Neuroscientist Explains the Science of Limerence and How to Overcome Romantic Obsession</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book "Smitten" delves into the psychological state of "limerence," an intense romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and extreme emotional dependency on another person. Bellamy explains that while limerence can be a natural part of early love, it can become a harmful addiction if the feelings are unreciprocated or the object of affection is unsuitable, leading to anxiety and craving. To break the cycle, he recommends strategies such as limiting contact, consciously turning positive daydreams into negative scenarios, and redirecting one's energy toward new personal goals and sources of fulfillment.</p>

          <h2>Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey's Unconventional 'Clown' Persona Faces Questions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 04:54:02 EDT</div>

          <p>This political analysis examines the strategy of UK Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, whose frequent use of playful stunts like bungee-jumping and jet-skiing has successfully garnered media attention. While these antics helped the party exceed expectations in the general election, polling suggests that many voters, including some Lib Dem supporters, now view them as making the party look less serious. As the party gathers for its conference, it faces the challenge of translating this visibility into a more substantive political platform. The party must now define its core economic and social policies to capitalize on the current weaknesses of the Conservative and Labour parties.</p>
