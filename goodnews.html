          <p>All SkyWest Airlines flights across the United States were temporarily grounded for 21 minutes on Friday night, a measure taken at the request of the airline itself, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA issued a ground stop advisory at 01:49 GMT, which was subsequently canceled at 02:10 GMT. No further details regarding the cause of the widespread grounding were immediately available, and SkyWest did not respond to requests for comment. SkyWest is recognized as the largest regional airline in the US, operating flights for major carriers including United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines, indicating the significant impact of this brief but comprehensive halt.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the entire United States. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb found that the policy's expansion likely violates migrants' due process rights. Previously limited to border areas and recent arrivals, the January directive sought to apply expedited removal anywhere in the country to those who arrived within the past two years. This decision is a significant setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, including operations that relied on this expanded authority to arrest asylum-seekers at courthouses.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie was eliminated from the US Open, losing to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic, aiming for a record 25th major title, secured a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory, despite struggling with a lower back injury that required a medical time-out. This marks Norrie's seventh consecutive defeat against the 38-year-old Serb, who expressed a lighthearted view on his on-court suffering, stating his team wants him to spend more time on court. The match lasted almost three hours, showcasing a challenging but ultimately successful progression for Djokovic.</p>

Their arduous 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia took 140 days, beating the previous record of 162 days. The brothers endured violent tropical storms, with Lachlan even being swept overboard at one point, highlighting the extreme challenges faced. They have been reunited with family in Cairns, Australia, and have so far raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar. Their achievement is a testament to their endurance and brotherly bond.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic stretch of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public just in time for Labor Day weekend, following years of closure due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures and collapsed pavement, with further destruction from the Bridge fire in 2024. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides renewed access to popular hiking trails and is expected to alleviate overcrowding at other trailheads. However, concerns remain about heightened fire danger warnings for the Angeles National Forest area during the busy holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, drawing attention from both retail and overseas investors seeking better investment alternatives. With Chinese stocks hitting a 10-year high, analysts like Jian Shi Cortesi of GAM Investments anticipate continued growth, fueled by domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation. Global asset managers are increasingly positive on Chinese stocks, viewing them as "undervalued innovation" in advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics, offering substantial room for growth compared to other major markets. This renewed interest follows years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus, signaling a potential turnaround for the combined US$20 trillion onshore and offshore equity markets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, allowing them to continue living and working in the US. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling, finding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that the TPS statute was designed to be predictable and insulated from political shifts. While the Department of Homeland Security criticized the decision as obstruction, this ruling offers a potential path for the administration's actions regarding Venezuelan TPS to be undone, though the immediate effect on those whose protections already expired remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B testified in a Los Angeles civil trial, denying accusations of assaulting a security guard in 2018. The security guard claims Cardi B cut her cheek with a fingernail and spat on her, leaving her traumatized, while the rapper insists the altercation was only verbal, sparked by the guard allegedly filming her during a private pregnancy appointment. The trial has garnered significant social media attention due to Cardi B's animated responses and humorous exchanges with the attorney, including questions about her wigs and nails. A plastic surgeon testified about the guard's "hyper-sensitive" scar, while the doctor Cardi B visited backed her account of not physically striking the guard.</p>

          <p>A unique mentorship program in London and Manchester is pairing anxious teenagers with three-year-olds from local nurseries to improve school attendance and engagement. Participants like 13-year-old Siena, who previously struggled with anxiety-driven school avoidance, have seen their attendance more than double. The charity Power2, which runs the scheme, believes giving disengaged teenagers responsibility for younger children in a controlled setting fosters confidence and accountability. The program involves weekly nursery visits and reflective sessions, with 78% of young people showing improved attitudes to learning and 83% enhanced self-esteem. This initiative offers a novel approach to addressing the significant issue of post-pandemic school absence.</p>

          <p>CVS and Walgreens are limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines in some states, requiring prescriptions or not offering them at all, to comply with state guidelines tied to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approvals. While FDA-approved vaccines are available for all seniors, they are only for younger adults and children with health conditions. CVS, for instance, cannot vaccinate individuals even with a prescription in Massachusetts, Nevada, and New Mexico due to state laws. This situation highlights a divergence in vaccine recommendations, as the American Academy of Pediatrics recently advised strong recommendations for children aged 6 months to 2 years, contrasting with the CDC's more cautious approach for healthy children.</p>

          <p>Traditional coffee chains like Costa are reportedly struggling to retain younger consumers, who are increasingly opting for trendy alternatives like iced strawberry matcha drinks offered by newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is reportedly considering selling the chain for significantly less than its 2019 purchase price, indicating market challenges. Analysts attribute this shift to changing coffee and tea drinking trends among Gen Z, who favor healthier options and unique experiences, often influenced by social media. With rising home coffee machine popularity and cost-of-living pressures, established chains must innovate to compete with smaller, artisanal businesses that cater to evolving consumer preferences for affordable luxury treats.</p>
