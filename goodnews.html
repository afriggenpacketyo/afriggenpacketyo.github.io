Terms such as "Skibidi," a versatile slang word popularized by a YouTube series, and "tradwife," referring to a traditional wife active on social media, are now officially included. The update also features words related to remote work, like "mouse jiggler," and tech culture, such as "broligarchy," which describes a small group of powerful men in the technology sector.

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler secured victory at the BMW Championship, overcoming a four-shot deficit on the final day to win his 18th PGA Tour title. Overnight leader Robert MacIntyre of Scotland faltered early with consecutive bogeys, allowing Scheffler to take the lead by the seventh hole. Despite some late-game tension and a few uncharacteristic errors from both players, Scheffler's class showed through, highlighted by a remarkable chip-in on the 17th hole. He finished with a three-under-par 67, ending the tournament at 15 under, two strokes clear of MacIntyre.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian designer who has previously worked with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicts he will adopt a more formal, military-style suit for his upcoming meeting with former President Donald Trump. This sartorial choice is anticipated following criticism Zelenskyy received for his informal attire during a tense Oval Office visit in February. Designer Elvira Gasanova suggests the Ukrainian leader will likely choose a serious look to avoid similar controversy, noting that he does not have personal stylists and that the pressures of war have physically affected him. The high-stakes meeting follows recent U.S.-Russia talks in Alaska aimed at negotiating an end to the war.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai, India, has sparked significant controversy, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious groups. Authorities implemented the ban due to health risks associated with pigeon droppings, which can cause respiratory illnesses. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding pigeons is a pious act, and from others who see the birds as part of the city's cultural fabric. With India's pigeon population increasing by over 150% since 2000, officials are now seeking a middle ground, potentially allowing controlled feeding based on expert recommendations.</p>

          <p>Two of China's largest drug manufacturers, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals and Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group, are projected to report substantial profit increases for the first half of the year. This growth is attributed to the successful rollout of new drugs and revenue generated from technology licensing agreements. Analysts estimate that Hengrui's net profit could rise by 40% to 4.1 billion yuan, with revenue climbing 9%. The company's strategic shift towards innovative drugs is reducing its reliance on generics, which are expected to constitute a much smaller portion of its business in the coming years.

          <p>The Green Party in the United Kingdom is at a strategic crossroads as it holds its leadership election, with candidates debating whether to adopt a more radical, populist approach or continue with a proven local-focused strategy. Deputy leader Zack Polanski is advocating for an "eco-populist" message to connect with voter anger, using blunt, anti-elite language. In contrast, his opponents, co-leader Adrian Ramsay and new MP Ellie Chowns, argue for maintaining the current, broader-appeal strategy that led to record success in the last general election. The outcome will determine the party's direction as it seeks to capitalize on discontent with traditional parties.</p>

The result also had positive implications for English golfers Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter, who both secured their positions in the league for the next season.</p>

          <p>Despite numerous economic headwinds such as slowing growth, inflation, and trade policy uncertainty, the stock market remains at record highs, primarily driven by strong corporate earnings. This article emphasizes that the ultimate measure of market health is the "bottom line"—the ability of companies to adapt and deliver on profit targets. While new tariffs and other risks could pressure profit margins, Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook for earnings growth over the next one to three years. This optimism about corporate profitability continues to be the most compelling explanation for the market's current resilience. (not investment advice)</p>
