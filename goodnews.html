          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 20:49:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK-EU summit is anticipated to pave the way for an agreement that could significantly reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border following Brexit. The BBC reports that the UK seeks to reset its relationship with the EU, potentially leading to a deal on trade issues, particularly in agri-food products. This could eliminate the need for checks and controls on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, although it would not entirely remove the sea border. The article also notes concerns from unionists about the current Brexit deal and the need for a closer UK-EU relationship to reduce obstacles to trade. </p>

          <p>The BBC explores how pop culture has reshaped the public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who murdered their parents. Initially portrayed as greedy killers, a growing understanding of trauma and sexual assault has led to increased sympathy for their claims of abuse. New evidence and Netflix dramas have fueled a new generation of supporters, and a judge recently reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole. The article examines how societal views on criminal justice and sexual abuse have evolved, potentially offering the brothers a chance at freedom. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night and creating hazardous conditions. The New York Times reports that visibility dropped drastically in Chicago, leading to the issuance of a dust storm warning, a rare occurrence for the city. The storm, likely a haboob, was caused by strong winds lifting dust from parched farmland, and the article notes that such events are uncommon in the region, with the last significant dust storm affecting Chicago during the Dust Bowl era. </p>
