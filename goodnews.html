          <p>Nissan Motor Co. has begun soliciting early retirement applications in the United States as part of its efforts to turn its fortunes around. The package targets employees in administrative departments and vehicle assembly plants, though specific details such as the number of eligible employees have not been disclosed. This program is part of Nissan's streamlining efforts, which include cutting 20,000 jobs and shutting seven vehicle plants globally, after logging a net loss of 670.90 billion yen for fiscal 2024. Nissan will also solicit early retirement applications from administrative staff in Japan this summer.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a court ruling allowing it to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" while it appeals a lower court's decision. Sony Pictures Television, which owns and produces the shows, is suing CBS, claiming the network entered into unauthorized licensing deals and underperformed in its distribution efforts. CBS argues that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, maintaining that it takes in up to 40% of the fees TV stations pay to carry the shows. The legal battle continues as the popular game shows remain among the most-watched programs on television.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Latino community with permanent residency in the United States is increasingly seeking naturalization as a response to intensified immigration enforcement and deportations. The USCIS reported over 7.9 million naturalizations in the last decade, with numbers rising further under the Trump administration. Community organizations and legal offices report a surge in interest as immigrants seek protection against deportation and aim to promote civic participation in upcoming elections. Academics note this trend is not only for protection but also an opportunity to advance electoral participation, similar to the increase in Latino voting after Proposition 187 in California.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the U.S. through Biden-era programs, ordering the government to restart processing applications for migrants seeking to renew their status. The sweeping order extends to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives. The judge stated that the termination of legal pathways for these groups was likely unlawful and would cause chaos. This decision is a major victory for civil and immigrant rights groups challenging the administration's efforts to strip legal status from various groups.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% year-over-year surge in data center sales. The company expects approximately $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, but would have been about $8 billion higher except for lost sales from export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. CEO Jensen Huang stated that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is "effectively closed to U.S. industry." Despite political tensions, Nvidia's report indicates continued growth, fueled by demand for its AI chips, and shares rose about 6% in extended trading (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit, potentially serving as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Ryosei Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a fourth round of tariff talks in Washington, indicating that such purchases could be within the scope of the discussions. Japan is hoping to schedule an in-person summit between Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.
