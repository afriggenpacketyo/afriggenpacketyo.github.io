          <p>Jerry Mathers, who played "Beaver" Cleaver, recently reflected on his time on the classic 1950s sitcom "Leave It to Beaver," describing a wholesome and supportive set. He credited his on-screen father, Hugh Beaumont, who was also a Methodist minister, with keeping the cast and crew "on the straight and narrow." Mathers emphasized the family-like atmosphere, noting that most of the crew were parents themselves, which contributed to a fun and caring environment for the child actors. The show's enduring popularity continues to bring him happy memories and connect him with devoted fans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay adapted from a forthcoming book argues that while statistics show Gen Z is having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are not uninterested in the topic. Instead, they are redefining sexuality by rejecting traditional gendered expectations and viewing sex through a political lens, spurred by events like the overturning of Roe v Wade. This generation, the most diverse in terms of identity and orientation, is seen as highly sexually progressive, challenging concepts like virginity and expanding the definition of what constitutes a sexual act. Their activism aims to dismantle traditional structures and reimagine desire for a more inclusive future.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll reveals that 50% of Japanese voters want the ruling coalition to lose its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba acknowledged the challenge, stating that retaining a majority is a crucial goal for his government. In other news, Japan's final H2A rocket successfully completed its 24-year service, and the country's tariff negotiator held further talks with the U.S. Commerce Secretary.

          <p>Judy Benjamin, an 81-year-old woman diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease 13 years ago, is currently walking across the United States to raise awareness about the potential for reversing cognitive decline. After experiencing symptoms and receiving a diagnosis, she became the first patient to follow Dr. Dale Bredesen's "ReCODE" protocol, which involves significant lifestyle changes in diet, exercise, and stress management. Benjamin reports that her cognitive symptoms have been reversed, and she is undertaking the 3,000-mile journey from San Diego to Florida as living proof.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has been forced into a significant U-turn on its planned welfare reforms after facing a rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the government had mishandled the rollout and that concessions were made after backbenchers raised "substantial" concerns about cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The changes, which include limiting cuts to new claimants and commissioning a review, have put the government in a "better position" to pass the bill. Rebel MPs now indicate they will likely support the revised legislation.</p>
