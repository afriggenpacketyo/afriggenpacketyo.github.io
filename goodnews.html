        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from consulting firm AlixPartners reveals widespread price increases across the fashion industry, averaging $17 year-over-year across nine categories. Jackets and outerwear experienced the most significant surge, with prices 24% higher on average, while swimwear saw the smallest hike at 2%. This trend, coupled with a late start to fall, could lead to inventory challenges for retailers who heavily invested in outerwear for the season. The article highlights how retailers are grappling with weak demand for higher-priced seasonal items, potentially impacting future discounting strategies and inventory management in the spring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates recently dropped to their lowest level in a month, triggering an 81% year-over-year surge in applications to refinance home loans. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased to 6.37%, prompting borrowers to seek lower monthly payments. While refinance demand soared, applications for new home purchases dropped 5% week-over-week, though still up 20% from a year ago. The increase in adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) applications, despite falling fixed rates, suggests buyers are doing everything they can to afford currently high home prices.

          <h2>Consumers Experience "Discount Burnout" Ahead of Holiday Shopping Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 07:00:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new AlixPartners report indicates that consumers are suffering from "discount burnout" due to a constant stream of promotions, making price less of a priority for shoppers ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The survey found a 13% drop in the importance assigned to price compared to last year, with shoppers now prioritizing consistent pricing, value for money, quality, and an improved in-store experience. This trend serves as a "warning" for retailers, suggesting that traditional discounting strategies may be less effective in a holiday season already challenged by inflation and an uncertain job market.</p>

          <p>Eurostar has confirmed a €2bn deal to order 30 "Celestia" double-decker trains from Alstom, with an option for 20 more, aiming to increase passenger capacity and support expansion plans. These will be the first double-decker high-speed trains to operate through the Channel Tunnel, with the first six expected by 2031. The new fleet, some replacing older models, will lead to a 30% increase in trains servicing London, supporting new routes to Geneva and Frankfurt. This strategic move could lead to cheaper fares and preempts potential competition, despite the UK's rail network largely being unsuitable for such tall trains.</p>

          <p>Former US Senator John E. Sununu has announced his bid for the Republican nomination in New Hampshire, seeking to reclaim the seat he lost in 2008 to Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. His entry sets up a primary against fellow former senator Scott Brown, who is closely aligned with Donald Trump. Sununu's past opposition to Trump, having backed Nikki Haley and called Trump a "loser," could pose a challenge in the primary, despite his family's political prominence. National Republicans view Sununu as a strong candidate to bolster their Senate majority, focusing on economic issues, healthcare costs, and Social Security.</p>

          <p>Eurostar announced a €2 billion agreement with French manufacturer Alstom to purchase up to 50 new double-decker "Celestia" trains, with the first deliveries expected in 2031. This expansion aims to increase passenger capacity by 20% and support new routes to cities like Geneva and Frankfurt, with Eurostar targeting 30 million passengers annually. The move comes as the company faces potential competition for the first time on the Channel Tunnel route, with several other operators expressing interest. While double-deckers are common in Europe, their use in the UK is limited due to infrastructure constraints, except for the high-speed line to St Pancras.</p>

          <p>British lender Barclays has upgraded its full-year guidance and announced a surprise £500 million ($667 million) share buyback, demonstrating consistent capital generation over the past nine quarters. This comes despite a 7% decline in third-quarter pre-tax profit to £2.1 billion, slightly below analyst expectations, and includes a £235 million charge related to the UK's car loans scandal. However, strong investment banking performance, with an 8% year-on-year income increase in that division, helped propel European financial stocks upward this year, with Barclays shares surging over 35% year-to-date.

          <p>This article explores the concept of "best friends" and the psychological benefits of prioritizing these deep connections for overall well-being. Research suggests that the quality of a few close friendships, rather than the quantity, is a strong predictor of individual happiness and can stave off emotional loneliness. Experts highlight qualities like trust, disclosure, and unwavering support as hallmarks of best friendships, noting that people subconsciously rank their social connections. The article argues that understanding and investing emotional resources in one's inner circle allows for a greater return on emotional investment and enhanced life satisfaction.</p>

          <p>UK inflation eased to 3.8% in September, below the feared 4%, offering relief to households, the government, and the Bank of England. While food prices showed signs of settling, inflation in services remains stubborn, partly due to rising wage bills. Economists anticipate inflation will continue to fall towards the 2% target next year, with average wage rises now comfortably outpacing inflation for many. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hinted at energy bill relief in the upcoming Budget, but businesses warn against further tax hikes that could reignite inflationary pressures. A potential "Santa cut" in interest rates in December is now being considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A crucial tip received via a GoFundMe page led to the arrest of Michael Anthony Arredondo in Mexico, the prime suspect in the deadly 2017 stabbing of Evin Paulos in Arizona. Paulos was found with about 30 stab wounds after last being seen with Arredondo, who had since disappeared. Paulos's family had created the fundraising page, which unexpectedly received a message in Spanish identifying Arredondo's location. This breakthrough, enabled by international collaboration, allowed investigators to apprehend Arredondo, who has reportedly confessed to the killing, bringing long-awaited justice to the family after six years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study provides compelling evidence that cognitive training can boost acetylcholine levels, a brain chemical typically declining with age, in people 65 and older. A 10-week regimen of rigorous mental exercises for 30 minutes daily increased acetylcholine by 2.3% in brain areas vital for attention and memory, effectively turning back the clock by about a decade. This finding supports previous animal research and suggests that scientifically tested brain-training programs, like BrainHQ, can have a significant and notable effect on cognitive performance. Even modest changes in this neuromodulator can profoundly impact memory and thinking.</p>

The plan includes a nod to the iconic "Smilin' Jack" storage tank and will involve extensive environmental remediation overseen by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board.

          <p>California business leaders are proposing a ballot initiative, the "Building an Affordable California Act," to overhaul the state’s environmental review process (CEQA) and expedite housing and infrastructure projects. The measure aims to establish stringent timelines for environmental oversight, requiring most essential projects, such as affordable housing and clean energy, to receive approvals within 365 days. Proponents argue CEQA is outdated and contributes to the state's high cost of living, while environmentalists contend it is crucial for protecting natural resources and vulnerable communities.
