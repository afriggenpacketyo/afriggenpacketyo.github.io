          <h2>Review: 'Spinal Tap II' Sequel Relies on Nostalgia and Cameos, Lacks Original's Satirical Edge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 18:58:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 mockumentary, titled "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert but struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor. The film sees Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls brought back together, yet the plot feels more like a feature-length outtake reel than a fresh comedic take. While offering some smiles for long-time fans, the review suggests that the reliance on celebrity cameos dilutes the satirical tension that made the original a classic. The sequel is seen as a pleasant but ultimately unnecessary nostalgia trip.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has elaborated on the company's $2.5 billion investment in its long-time partner Corning, which will manufacture all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches at its Kentucky facility. Cook highlighted the superior quality and durability of Corning's "ceramic shield" technology as a key factor in the decision to deepen the partnership. The major investment is expected to triple the plant's production and increase its workforce by 50%, reinforcing the facility as a world-leading site for specialized glass manufacturing. Cook emphasized that such domestic investments create hubs of economic activity that benefit local communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by overriding local zoning laws. The bill mandates the construction of higher-density housing, with buildings up to nine stories tall, near major transit corridors like train stations and bus routes. Proponents, including Sen. Scott Wiener, argue the measure is crucial for increasing housing supply and affordability, while critics and some local officials call it a state overreach that strips communities of control. The bill, which gained momentum after securing support from a major construction labor union, now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature.</p>

Apple recently showcased a "Live Translation" feature for its new AirPods Pro 3, capable of instantly translating several languages. This development places Apple in direct competition with Google's Pixel phones, which offer a similar "Voice Translate" feature, and Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. The emergence of these powerful AI-driven tools marks a new battleground in the tech industry and could significantly reshape communication and industries that rely on human interpreters.</p>

          <p>New documents reviewed by Reuters show that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook declared her Atlanta property as a "vacation home" on a 2021 loan estimate. This evidence appears to counter accusations from the Trump administration that she committed mortgage fraud by claiming both her Atlanta and Michigan homes as primary residences. The administration has sought her dismissal over the allegations, which Cook denies. Real estate experts suggest the "vacation home" declaration on the loan document strengthens her case, indicating she was transparent with her lender about the property's intended use from the outset.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's legal team has refuted claims made by actor Justin Baldoni's attorney that the pop star had agreed to be deposed in his legal dispute with co-star Blake Lively. Swift's lawyer stated that she has "no material role" in the case and would only comply with a deposition if compelled by the court. The issue arose after Baldoni's team requested a deadline extension to accommodate Swift's schedule. Lively's attorneys have accused Baldoni of trying to involve Swift to create a "media spectacle," further escalating the contentious legal battle stemming from their 2024 film.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff commented on competitor Palantir, expressing that he is "so inspired" by the data management software company, particularly its high market valuation. However, Benioff also took another opportunity to criticize Palantir's pricing, calling it "the most expensive enterprise software I've ever seen" and joking that perhaps he should be charging more. The comments highlight the growing rivalry between the two firms, which sometimes compete for government contracts. While Salesforce is much larger by revenue, Palantir has seen faster growth and has become highly popular with retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the conviction and sentencing of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro for conspiracies related to his failed 2022 reelection bid. The author draws parallels between Bolsonaro and President Trump, noting both tested democratic norms, vilified opponents, and claimed electoral fraud after losing. The article highlights how Brazil's judicial system held Bolsonaro accountable, a process the author suggests serves as a potent example for the United States. It also criticizes President Trump's attempt to intervene in the case by threatening Brazil with tariffs, framing it as a departure from democratic principles.</p>
