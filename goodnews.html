Kardashian appeared to humorously acknowledge the look in a social media video with her makeup artist, continuing her history of making provocative and conversation-starting fashion statements at high-profile events.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter used her hosting and musical guest appearance on "Saturday Night Live" to playfully address criticism of her bawdy public persona and controversial album art. Through sketches, including one about a suggestive ergonomic pillow and another portraying a "girlboss" seminar host, she satirized the idea that her sexuality is deferential to a male fantasy. Her performance served as a comedic rebuttal to those who have scrutinized her transition from a former Disney star to a more provocative adult artist, questioning the controversy surrounding her image.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team clinched a place in the World Cup semi-finals after a dramatic four-run victory against co-hosts India. England set a target of 289, anchored by Heather Knight's century, but India appeared poised for victory at 234-3, led by Smriti Mandhana's 88 runs. However, Mandhana's dismissal triggered a collapse in the Indian middle order, and despite a late effort from Deepti Sharma, they fell just short. The tense finish highlighted England's composure under pressure in a crucial tournament match.</p>

          <p>Following a trip to San Francisco for Salesforce's AI conference, market commentator Jim Cramer shared several key takeaways for investors. He noted that Salesforce's AI platform, Agentforce, is demonstrating real-world utility and driving revenue growth, countering skepticism about its value. Cramer also observed growing concern among OpenAI backers about its consumer-focused spending, though he highlighted Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's strong confidence in their partnership. Other insights included the non-zero-sum nature of the AI chip buildout and the resurgence of Levi Strauss's women's line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While smoking prevalence in Southeast Asia has significantly decreased over the past two decades due to strong public health policies, the fight against tobacco is not over. Population growth means the absolute number of smokers has risen, and the growing popularity of e-cigarettes, particularly among youth, presents a new challenge. Furthermore, the tobacco industry continues to exert considerable influence on government policy in some nations, such as Indonesia, which recently scrapped a planned tax hike. Countries that have banned vaping aim to prevent a new generation from becoming addicted to nicotine.</p>

The administration had previously paused cancellations under the Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay as You Earn plans, citing court orders related to a separate Biden-era program. This agreement reopens a path to debt relief for millions of borrowers, although the programs themselves are scheduled to be phased out by 2028 under a new law.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While declining to speculate on the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The government is under pressure to reduce energy costs, with Labour having previously pledged to lower average bills. Scrapping the VAT could save the average household around £86 per year, though Miliband emphasized that a long-term shift to clean energy is the ultimate solution.</p>
