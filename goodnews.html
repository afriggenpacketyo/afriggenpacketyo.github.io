          <p>President Trump announced that May 8 will be recognized as World War II "Victory Day" in the United States, aligning with Europe's "Victory in Europe Day" since Germany's surrender in 1945. Trump emphasized the significant role America played in securing victory. Additionally, November 11 will be designated as World War I "Victory Day." Trump expressed a desire to celebrate American victories more often, attributing the lack of celebration to ineffective leadership in the past. The article underscores Trump's perspective on American strength and the need to commemorate its historical achievements. </p>

          <p>China is reportedly easing its restrictions on K-pop acts, potentially signaling a shift to boost domestic demand amid trade tensions with the U.S. The first K-pop group concert since 2016 is scheduled in mainland China, and a large-scale K-pop event is planned for Hainan province. Analysts suggest this move is part of China's strategy to stimulate discretionary spending in tourism, hospitality, and local commerce. K-pop is also seen as a tariff-proof sector, with core revenue drivers being digital and intangible, making them immune to cross-border tariffs.</p>

Judge Rodriguez found that the act's language, such as ‚Äúinvasion,‚Äù referred to an attack by military forces and did not align with Trump‚Äôs claims about the activities of the Tren de Aragua gang.

          <p>Roche and Zealand Pharma have entered a $5.3 billion agreement to co-develop and co-commercialize Zealand's petrelintide amylin analog, a next-generation weight loss candidate. This deal signifies Roche's effort to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the growing obesity drug market. The partnership will explore petrelintide as both a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset CT-388. Early clinical data suggests that amylin analogs may offer comparable weight reduction to GLP-1s with potentially superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool fans celebrating their title-clinching win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield caused a series of earth tremors, according to university scientists. The most significant tremor, registering a peak magnitude of 1.74 on the Richter scale, was caused by Alexis Mac Allister's goal. Data revealed that the 60,415-strong crowd generated real seismic activity in response to the goals scored during the game. Researchers hope the experiment will inspire new applications for seismology.</p>

          <p>India will include caste details in its next census, a decision with potentially sweeping socio-economic and political ramifications. The move is likely to lead to demands to raise quotas for government jobs, college admissions, and elected offices for certain castes. Successive governments have resisted updating caste data, but supporters say it is necessary for implementing social justice programs. The announcement comes months before a crucial election in Bihar, where caste is a key issue.</p>
