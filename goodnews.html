          <p>Former President Donald Trump visited Capitol Hill to assist Speaker Mike Johnson in garnering support from Republican hard-liners for his legislative agenda. With Speaker Johnson needing every vote to pass the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," Trump's presence aimed to unify the party amidst concerns from both conservatives and moderates. The bill faces sticking points regarding Medicaid work requirements and state and local tax deductions, with ongoing negotiations attempting to strike a balance. Speaker Johnson expressed optimism about reaching an equilibrium point, emphasizing the bottom-up process used to develop the bill, while aides stressed that significant portions of the bill are already finalized.</p>

          <p>Richard Garwin, the physicist who designed the first hydrogen bomb, passed away at 97, leaving behind a complex legacy. Though his work brought the world a weapon of unprecedented destructive power, Garwin dedicated his life to undoing the dangers it posed. Inspired by a conversation with Enrico Fermi, Garwin advised 13 presidents on nuclear arms control and pushed for a comprehensive test ban treaty. Despite his pivotal role in creating the H-bomb, Garwin initially kept it secret, fearing the attention of foreign intelligence agencies, and he maintained that its development was inevitable, though he sped it up. He also contributed to the advancement of spy satellite technology and the discovery of gravitational waves.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful and a "gross usurpation of power." The ruling stated that President Trump's efforts to dismantle the agency exceeded his constitutional authorities and violated the statute that established USIP. Judge Howell criticized the use of law enforcement to carry out the executive order, stating it traumatized USIP employees. The ruling effectively nullifies the actions taken by DOGE officials, including the removal of USIP's president and staff, and the transfer of USIP property.</p>

          <p>President Trump is demanding a "major investigation" into celebrity endorsements of former Vice President Kamala Harris, alleging illegal payments were made to stars like Beyonc√© and Bruce Springsteen. Trump criticized the celebrities for supporting his opponent, accusing the Harris campaign of using payments for entertainment as a guise for illegal endorsements. He specifically cited unconfirmed reports that Beyonc√© received $11 million to endorse Harris, while also targeting Taylor Swift for her past support. Trump's outburst followed criticism from Springsteen regarding the "incompetent and treasonous administration," which led to a heated exchange between the two.</p>

While the price has declined almost 6% since late April, this opens up new opportunities for both current and new investors. Experts recommend re-evaluating gold holdings, avoiding panic, considering buying more, and remembering gold's long-term benefits as an inflation hedge and portfolio diversifier. It's important to explore alternative types of gold investments and resist the urge to rush to sell. (not investment advice)</p>
