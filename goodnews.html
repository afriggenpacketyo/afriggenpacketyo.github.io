          <p>India's Supreme Court has temporarily suspended an earlier order for the mass removal of stray dogs in New Delhi, issuing a revised directive that mandates sterilization and immunization before the animals are released, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behavior. This new approach follows widespread protests from animal rights activists who criticized the previous order as inhumane and impractical. The court also called for the establishment of designated feeding zones and plans to formulate a comprehensive nationwide policy to address the high number of daily dog bite incidents. The decision seeks a more humane and sustainable solution to the issue.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate decreased to 3.1% in July, a slight dip from the previous month but still higher than economists' expectations. Headline inflation also reached its lowest point since November 2024, at 3.1%. Notably, rice inflation eased to 90.7% after a period of significant price increases, signaling a potential moderation in overall food costs. Despite this, the Bank of Japan's 'core-core' inflation remained steady, maintaining pressure for a potential interest rate hike as the central bank is seen as 'behind the curve' in addressing inflation.

          <p>The World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization issued a report highlighting the increasing health and productivity risks for workers exposed to extreme heat, a problem exacerbated by climate change. The report notes that productivity declines by 2% for every degree above 20C, and workplace accidents increase significantly during heatwaves. It urges governments, employers, and workers to collaborate on adaptation strategies, such as implementing work stoppages during peak heat, redesigning uniforms, or improving building ventilation, to ensure safer and more bearable working conditions globally. The findings serve as a wake-up call for investment in climate adaptation.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after leaving the country, aiming to save £350 million over the next five years. New regulations will generally disqualify claimants residing abroad for more than eight weeks, unless exceptional circumstances apply. A dedicated specialist team will use travel data to identify ineligible cases, building on a successful pilot that recovered £17 million. This initiative seeks to prevent incorrect payments and raise awareness about eligibility rules, with plans to examine other benefits claimed overseas.</p>
