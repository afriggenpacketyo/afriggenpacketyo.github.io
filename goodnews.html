          <p>A grand juror involved in the high-profile Karen Read murder case has pleaded guilty to criminal contempt for disclosing confidential information. The juror, Jessica Leslie, admitted in a Boston federal court to willfully violating court rules by sharing details about the proceedings, including witness names and testimony, with unauthorized individuals. Read was recently acquitted of murder in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. Leslie has agreed to a sentence of one day of incarceration and 24 months of supervised release, highlighting the serious legal consequences of breaching the secrecy of grand jury proceedings in a case that has drawn significant public attention.</p>

          <p>Shares of Axon Enterprise, the company known for TASER devices, surged 14% after it reported quarterly results that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations and raised its full-year revenue forecast. The company attributed its strong performance to accelerating demand for its security technology, including body cameras, drones, and counter-drone systems. Revenue for the quarter jumped 33% to $668.5 million, with adjusted earnings per share also beating estimates. Axon's CEO noted that growth was robust across all segments, reflecting heightened security needs and strong interest in the company's expanding ecosystem of products and services.

          <p>A months-long undercover investigation by the BBC has exposed the operations of a violent and powerful Iraqi-Kurdish gang smuggling people across the English Channel. A reporter posing as a migrant gained access to the gang's hideout in northern France and documented its methods, including using associates in the UK to collect cash payments. The investigation identified key leaders of the organization and revealed its tactic of frequently changing names to evade authorities. The report highlights the extreme dangers faced by migrants, including a tragic incident where five people were trampled to death, and the significant challenges authorities face in dismantling these sophisticated criminal networks.</p>

          <p>A new class-action lawsuit has been launched against FIFA, potentially heralding a major shift in soccer's transfer system. The Dutch foundation Justice for Players is suing the world governing body and several European football associations, arguing that current transfer regulations unlawfully restrict players' freedom of movement and have suppressed their earnings. The case, advised by the same lawyer behind the landmark 1995 Bosman ruling, could allow players to terminate their contracts without their club receiving compensation. Legal experts describe the lawsuit as a 'seismic confrontation' that could prove as transformational as the Bosman case, which fundamentally reshaped player mobility in the sport.</p>

          <p>NASA's acting administrator has directed the agency to launch and deploy a small nuclear power plant on the moon's surface by late 2029, framing the initiative as a strategic race against China and Russia. The directive warns that the first nation to establish a lunar reactor could potentially declare an exclusionary zone, hindering the U.S. Artemis exploration program. The plan calls for a 100-kilowatt fission reactor, which would be essential for powering a future lunar base. This ambitious timeline comes as the U.S. aims to accelerate the development of microreactor technology and asserts its presence in a new era of space competition.</p>

          <p>LAFC has completed one of the most significant signings in MLS history, acquiring South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min from the English Premier League's Tottenham. The deal involved a transfer fee that reportedly sets a new MLS record, surpassing $22 million. The move is seen as a major coup for LAFC and the league, expected to boost the team's performance, elevate the league's global profile, and energize Southern California's large Korean community. For Son, the transfer allows him to adapt to North American conditions ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which he has suggested may be his last.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has ended with the capture of Austin Robert Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect in the killing of four people in northwest Tennessee. Drummond was taken into custody in a wooded area in Jackson by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. He is the prime suspect in the deaths of Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend, whose bodies were found on July 29. The investigation was launched after the victims' infant was found abandoned in a car seat in a nearby county. Drummond faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated kidnapping.</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, has announced that the country will hold its next general election in February 2026. This will be the first election since a mass student-led uprising in 2024 led to the resignation and exile of longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Speaking on the first anniversary of Hasina's ouster, Yunus confirmed that his caretaker government would step down following the vote. He also read out the 'July Declaration,' a document intended to give constitutional recognition to the uprising and ensure that future governments cannot become authoritarian, marking a pivotal step in the nation's political transition.</p>

          <h2>Sean Combs Denied Bail and Will Remain in Custody Until October Sentencing</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean 'Diddy' Combs' request for release on bail, ordering him to remain in custody until his sentencing on October 3. Last month, the music mogul was convicted on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution, though he was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges. In denying the request, the judge cited evidence of violence presented during the trial, including Combs' physical assault of his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, and determined that he posed a danger to the community. The judge also noted that Combs presents a flight risk, dismissing his lawyers' arguments for release on a $50 million bond.</p>
