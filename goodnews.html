          <p>A previously overlooked manuscript in Harvard Law School's library has been identified as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta by two British academics. Purchased for a mere $27.50 after World War II, the faint, water-stained document was initially thought to be a copy. The article details the authentication process, including ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging, and highlights the document's significance in the evolution of Western notions of rights and freedoms. The discovery is considered providential, especially at a time when Harvard faces external pressures, and the manuscript's value is estimated to be in the millions.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article delves into the secrets of winning the Eurovision Song Contest, analyzing winning acts since 2000. Key factors include singing about personal liberation, preferably in English, and incorporating folk music elements without making it a pure folk song. The article advises against dramatic key changes, which were once a Eurovision staple, and emphasizes the importance of an all-out staging with fire or pyrotechnics, while cautioning against novelty acts that are too jokey. Ultimately, the article suggests that success lies in blending unique elements to create a memorable performance.</p>

          <p>A Communist Party journal suggests China has the financial capacity to establish a market stabilization fund due to its strong economy and large foreign exchange reserves. The Study Times article emphasizes the need to stabilize the market amid global economic instability caused by trade tensions. The article notes that similar mechanisms have been used by other major economies, including Hong Kong during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, to manage market volatility. The proposal comes as China navigates trade relations and seeks to protect investors' interests.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog is set to introduce guidelines aimed at preventing Google and Apple from blocking competition in their respective app stores. The new law, expected to fully take effect in December, seeks to promote fair competition from smaller firms. The law will also prohibit the firms from using data obtained from the operation of their app stores or operating systems in their own products or services, as this would give an advantage in development and other activities, the commission said. The commission hopes the promotion of competition will benefit consumers by helping reduce prices and improve access to convenient apps.</p>
