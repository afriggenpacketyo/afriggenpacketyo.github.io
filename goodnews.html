          <p>Fidelity's recent analysis of over 25,000 corporate 401(k) plans revealed that the average savings rate, including both employee and company contributions, has reached a record high of 14.3% during the first quarter of 2025. Employees are deferring 9.5% of their income, while companies are contributing 4.8%. Fidelity recommends aiming for a 15% savings target to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement, but experts emphasize that the ideal percentage varies based on individual circumstances such as existing savings and planned retirement date. Many companies offer 401(k) matching contributions, which employees should take advantage of as it's essentially 'free money' to boost their retirement savings (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>According to Fidelity Investments, average 401(k) balances decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2025, falling to $127,100 due to recent market fluctuations. Individual retirement account balances also experienced a 4% drop, settling at $121,983, although both 401(k) and IRA balances showed year-over-year growth. Fidelity noted that the majority of retirement savers continued to contribute, with the average 401(k) contribution rate, including employer and employee contributions, rising to 14.3%, just below Fidelity's recommended 15% savings rate.
