          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has committed to improving the treatment and working conditions of Self-Defense Forces (SDF) personnel, acknowledging the increasingly challenging security environment they face. Speaking at a roundtable with young SDF members, Ishiba emphasized the government's responsibility to appropriately support those serving, particularly in light of recent scandals that have impacted public trust. This pledge follows the enactment of a revised law that includes new allowances for SDF members, as the government seeks to address a shortage of recruits. Ishiba also affirmed the government's commitment to safeguarding Japan's independence and peace, referencing regional security threats.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first train company to be renationalized under Labour, with the initial nationalized service departing on time from Woking to Surbiton. The government has described this transition as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on service improvements and infrastructure investment, though immediate fare reductions are not guaranteed. The renationalized SWR will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval, and will be overseen by the Department for Transport in the interim. Unions have expressed concerns about outsourcing, while the opposition Conservatives are pressing Labour to fulfill its promises.</p>

          <p>A virologist at the University of Nottingham has urged the public to remain calm following the detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, emphasizing that while the discovery warrants awareness, it is not cause for significant concern. The UK Health Security Agency found fragments of the virus in wetland in Retford, Nottinghamshire, marking the first time it has been detected in the UK. Prof Jonathan Ball believes climate change will spread tropical diseases north. He noted that climate change is likely to increase the range of mosquito-borne diseases, leading to a greater risk of such viruses becoming established further north.</p>
