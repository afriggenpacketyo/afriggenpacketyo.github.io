          <p>In a recent group interview for their upcoming film "After the Hunt," actress Julia Roberts shared that she was surprisingly "scared" and intimidated before her first meeting with co-star Chloë Sevigny. Roberts recounted the moment at her home, where she, along with other cast and crew, awaited Sevigny's arrival for a rehearsal, admitting her nervousness to those present. Sevigny, in contrast, expressed feeling an immediate closeness to Roberts and praised her generosity during the production, even watching several of Roberts' classic films on the flight home because she missed her. The film centers on a college professor caught in the middle of a sexual assault accusation involving a student and a colleague.</p>

          <p>A new stage adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel "Emma" transports the story from Regency England to modern-day Essex, complete with nightclubs, dating apps, and social media anxieties. Written by Ava Pickett and staged at London's Rose Theatre, this version portrays Emma Woodhouse as a clever but meddling university dropout who interferes in her friends' love lives. The adaptation explores contemporary themes of online validation, ghosting, and the complexities of female friendships in the digital age. The creative team discusses how Austen's core themes of love, jealousy, and the human condition remain relevant and resonant with today's audiences.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi shares her remarkable story of taking a last-minute job as a cook on a cargo schooner, only to become stranded at sea for over six months when the COVID-19 pandemic began. What was meant to be a three-month voyage from Europe to Central America turned into a 188-day ordeal as ports worldwide closed, preventing the crew from disembarking. The article details the crew's experiences, including a dramatic rescue of migrants off the coast of Gran Canaria and the psychological challenges of isolation. Baccosi describes how they coped with dwindling supplies and growing tensions before finally making landfall in the Azores and returning to Germany.</p>

          <h2>Investigating Whether the Muscle-Building Supplement Creatine Can Also Improve Cognitive Function</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 19:02:35 EDT</div>

          <p>Creatine, a popular supplement known for enhancing athletic performance and muscle growth, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, including alleviating "brain fog." This article examines the growing body of research suggesting that creatine, which helps cells produce energy, may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. While thousands of studies have validated its effects on physical strength, its impact on the brain is less established but promising, particularly for individuals under stress or with dietary deficiencies. Experts note that while more research is needed, the supplement could potentially help mitigate cognitive symptoms associated with conditions like perimenopause or sleep deprivation.</p>

          <h2>White House Details TikTok Deal Giving U.S. Companies Control Over Algorithm</h2>

          <p>The White House has announced the terms of a potential deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, which would place the app's powerful algorithm under American control. Under the proposed agreement, U.S. companies would manage the algorithm, and Americans would hold six of the seven board seats for its U.S. entity. Tech giant Oracle, led by Trump ally Larry Ellison, is set to manage the data and privacy aspects of the operation. This development follows a prolonged period of pressure from the U.S. government over national security concerns related to TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though Beijing has not yet publicly commented on the new terms.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is steadily strengthening and is forecast to become a hurricane over the weekend. The storm is currently located in the central Atlantic and is projected to pass east of Bermuda early next week before moving further out into the open ocean. While no direct landfall is expected in the United States, swells generated by Gabrielle are anticipated to create dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents along the East Coast. The National Hurricane Center is monitoring the storm's northwest track as it continues to gain intensity over the water.</p>

          <p>The popular UK dance competition "Strictly Come Dancing" has launched its 21st season, unveiling the new pairings of celebrity contestants and professional dancers. Among the notable couples, Apprentice star Thomas Skinner will dance with Amy Dowden, who is returning to the show after a cancer diagnosis. The launch show also featured a performance from last year's winners, Chris McCausland and Dianne Buswell, and singer Jessie J. This season introduces a change to the voting system, moving to a fully online model and eliminating the previous premium-rate phone lines as the contestants begin their journey toward the grand final in December.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Achieve Breakthrough in Nuclear Fusion Research by Compressing Diamonds with Lasers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant advance for fusion energy research, scientists have for the first time observed diamond capsules undergoing shock-induced amorphization, a process where their atomic structure collapses under extreme pressure. By firing powerful lasers at the diamonds, researchers simulated the conditions needed for nuclear fusion, gaining crucial insights into how material flaws can lead to asymmetrical implosions that hinder energy release. This better understanding of how diamonds behave under immense pressure could help scientists create more stable and efficient fusion reactions. The discovery marks a key step toward harnessing fusion as a clean, nearly limitless energy source, which could reduce global reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Bruno Fernandes marked his 200th game for Manchester United with a pivotal performance in their 2-1 victory over Chelsea, scoring his 100th goal for the club. However, it was his relentless effort and emotional displays of leadership that underscored his importance to the team. Manager Ruben Amorim praised the captain's influence, stating Fernandes "deserves to be in the history of our club" for his commitment. Despite ongoing debates about his best position on the field and occasional criticism of his temperament, Fernandes's passion and drive were on full display, highlighting his critical role in a team still striving for consistent success under its new manager.</p>

          <h2>UK's Liberal Democrats Aim to Reclaim Patriotism from the Far Right</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At their party conference, the UK's Liberal Democrats made a conspicuous effort to embrace patriotic symbols, aiming to reclaim them from nationalist and far-right groups. Former leader Tim Farron delivered a rousing speech, draping himself in a Blackburn Rovers football flag and urging members to wave the nation's flags with pride. The move represents a strategic shift for the party, which has historically shied away from overt displays of nationalism. Party leader Sir Ed Davey also participated, leading a marching band through Bournemouth in a deliberately patriotic stunt, as the party seeks to position itself as the true voice of British values against rivals like Reform UK.</p>
