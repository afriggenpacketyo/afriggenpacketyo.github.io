        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The ruling prevents the government from deporting Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge stated that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled. However, the administration can still attempt to deport Khalil for allegedly omitting details on his green card application. The Trump administration has been attempting to deport several international students involved in pro-Palestinian campus activism.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has reminded travelers about the food items they can bring on flights, including pizza, chocolate, and donuts, in either carry-on or checked bags. Solid food items are generally permitted, but liquids and gels must be in containers of 3.4 ounces or less. The TSA advises passengers to separate food items that may clutter bags and obstruct clear images on the X-ray machine. Even live lobsters are allowed in clear, plastic, spill-proof containers, subject to airline policies. Passengers flying from Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands to the mainland have restrictions on fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has issued a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from deporting or continuing to detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil. The injunction prevents the administration from removing Khalil based on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that his presence poses a risk to foreign policy. The judge stayed the injunction to allow the Department of Homeland Security time to appeal the decision. Khalil, a green card holder, has been detained since March, with officials claiming he supports Hamas, allegations his legal team denies.</p>

          <p>With the conflict in Ukraine dragging into its fourth year, an institution designed to supplement and actualise Article 33 of the United Nations Charter is something the world increasingly needs as Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine drags into its fourth year. Recent peace talks in Istanbul produced no appreciable progress, while swings on the battlefield have long since given way to a grinding impasse. Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russia‚Äôs ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia have expressed openness to negotiations, but divisions remain. The United States is unable to bring about peace, and NATO does not hold the answer, instead China may be the world's best chance for peace in Ukraine.</p>
