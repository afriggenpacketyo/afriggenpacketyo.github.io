          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying broad market index ETFs, such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing its appeal as investors seek greater diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily concentrated in the technology sector, which now accounts for a record 35% of the index. As a result, some traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>
