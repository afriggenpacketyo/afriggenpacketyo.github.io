          <h2>Federal Rental Aid Program's Time Limits and Their Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of time limits on federal rental assistance, focusing on a program in Delaware that requires recipients to work and save money. The Delaware program provides a savings account that recipients can access when they move out, creating an incentive for self-sufficiency. While some argue that time limits encourage turnover and upward mobility, others worry about the potential for homelessness, especially in areas with skyrocketing rent. The article provides examples of programs where time limits have both succeeded and failed, underscoring the importance of additional support services. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how the evolving tastes of China's Gen Z are reshaping the liquor industry, with a shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, a town famous for its liquor production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain to meet the demand for these new drinks. Liquor brands are innovating their products to appeal to younger consumers, who prioritize self-indulgent experiences over traditional social rituals. This trend could potentially upend China's alcohol market, where baijiu has long been the dominant choice. </p>
