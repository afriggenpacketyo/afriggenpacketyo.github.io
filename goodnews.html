The outcome was uncertain until the final moments, especially after a strong preceding set of balls from Jofra Archer had put the Southern Brave in a favorable position.

While the financial terms were not disclosed, recent valuations placed the team's worth at $3.65 billion. Dundon, a businessman with a growing portfolio of sports properties including professional pickleball leagues, would take over from Allen's sister, Jody Allen, who has managed the team since 2018. The sale is pending approval from the NBA, following a previous rejected offer from Nike co-founder Phil Knight in 2022.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a portion of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension by the National Science Foundation violated a previous preliminary injunction that barred the agency from terminating grants within the UC system. The administration had frozen the funds and alleged the university allowed antisemitism during pro-Palestinian campus protests, a move critics have called a form of extortion and an infringement on academic freedom.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced an expansion of its employee discount program, now offering its 1.6 million U.S. workers a 10% discount on nearly all grocery items, including meat and milk. Previously, the discount on most food items was limited to the holiday season. The company stated the change was made in response to employee feedback and comes as economists and retailers watch for the impact of rising tariffs on consumer prices. The move could help retain workers and encourage them to spend more at Walmart's own stores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League has released a new forecast predicting that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries received this year. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has been moderate in 2025, some economists worry that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data from analytics firm Similarweb indicates that traffic to the most popular pornography websites in the United Kingdom has fallen significantly since new age verification rules were enforced on July 25. Under the Online Safety Act, sites must implement advanced checks to prevent minors from accessing explicit material. Pornhub, the UK's top adult site, saw its daily visitor numbers drop by 47% in the two weeks following the change. While compliant sites have seen a decrease, the data also suggests a corresponding increase in traffic to smaller, less-regulated sites.</p>

This positive outlook comes as universities are reportedly keen to enroll domestic students due to uncertainty around international student numbers.

The order mandates that ICE must reduce the number of detainees and provide them with basic necessities such as sleeping mats, hygiene products, medication, and adequate legal access. The ruling came after a lawsuit from the ACLU and video evidence revealed detainees sleeping on the floor in crowded, unsanitary conditions.
