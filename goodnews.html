          <p>The remains of two Scottish soldiers, missing for over 100 years since the Battle of Loos in World War I, have been identified through a meticulous investigation. Construction workers in France discovered the remains in 2021, leading a specialist UK Ministry of Defence unit, nicknamed the "war detectives," to use historical records, personal artifacts like tramway buttons, and DNA testing to confirm their identities. Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan were recently buried with full military honors, bringing long-awaited closure to their families.</p>

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the devastation, conducting rescue missions and delivering essential supplies. Coordinated by groups like the United Cajun Navy, they performed hundreds of missions, airlifting stranded residents and providing a vital lifeline of food and medicine to isolated communities before larger-scale relief could arrive.</p>

          <h2>Funding Disparity Highlights Stakes in Women's Rugby World Cup Final Between England and Canada</h2>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases a stark contrast in resources, pitting the world's best-funded team against a squad that relies on fundraising. England's Rugby Football Union invests heavily in its 32 full-time professional players and a strong domestic league, contributing to their dominant record. In contrast, Canada's players earn a fraction of that and their World Cup preparations were partly funded by donations, yet they have reached the final through creative coaching and by having many players compete in England's professional league.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final, the careers of several England players highlight the evolution of the women's game from amateur to professional status. While most of the squad is now fully professional, hooker Amy Cokayne continues to serve as a police officer in the Royal Air Force through its Elite Athlete Scheme. This contrasts with the 2014 World Cup-winning team, where veteran Marlie Packer had to take unpaid leave from her job as a plumber to compete, showcasing the significant progress made in supporting female athletes over the last decade.</p>

          <p>A new and diverse peace movement is gaining traction in Germany, with large demonstrations calling for an end to arms deliveries and active support for peace negotiations in both Gaza and Ukraine. A recent rally in Berlin, organized by prominent politician Sahra Wagenknecht, drew over 10,000 people, including well-known artists and activists united against what they term "inhumane wars." While the movement is currently fragmented, with different groups organizing separate events, the growing public debate over reintroducing compulsory military service could further mobilize young people and unify the various factions.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing an "ambitious" youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping its positive economic impact will be factored into the upcoming autumn Budget forecasts. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18 to 30 to work in the UK for up to two years, which Reeves argues will stimulate growth and benefit businesses. By having the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) officially score the scheme's economic benefits, the government hopes to create more fiscal flexibility and potentially reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, there is a possibility it could interact with a nearby developing storm system, potentially creating a rare meteorological phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This occurs when two tropical storms get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. While meteorologists consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario due to the distance and strength difference between the two systems, it remains a possibility they are closely monitoring as the storms evolve.</p>

Speaking at a festival in author Emily Brontë's hometown, Fennell described the book as singular, sexy, and devastating, and explained that her adaptation is an emotional response meant to fulfill her "14-year-old wish" of what the story felt like.</p>
