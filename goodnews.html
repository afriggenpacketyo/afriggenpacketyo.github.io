          <p>BeOne Medicines, a Chinese global drug company, plans to introduce more cancer drugs to Hong Kong, leveraging recent drug-approval reforms. The company has already brought three cancer medications to the region and seeks approval for additional medical uses by year's end. BeOne's Guangzhou facility, which produces large molecule therapies, will expand production to supply Hong Kong in the future. The company's flagship product, a small-molecule drug, has driven profitability in global markets. The increased availability of cancer drugs will likely be a boon for patients in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's competitive nature as they contend for the title. Hamilton, recalling his own intense rivalry with Verstappen, emphasized the need for a cut-throat mentality to fend off Verstappen's challenge. George Russell acknowledged McLaren's superior car but cautioned against discounting Verstappen's consistent performance. The McLaren drivers are allowed to race freely, but must avoid crashing into each other. Verstappen stated that his team needs to be perfect to have a chance at winning, while Piastri described Red Bull's actions as "gamesmanship."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has reportedly informed the Department of Justice that there is not enough evidence to indict Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges. This follows calls from President Trump for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute Schiff, a vocal critic of the president. MSNBC reported that U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the investigation, expressing her doubts about the strength of the case. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, stated that the allegations against the senator are baseless and politically motivated. The investigation is reportedly ongoing.</p>

          <p>Industry experts suggest that increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China could advance the cryptocurrency sector. This assessment comes despite the mainland's ban on various crypto-related activities. Hong Kong focuses on virtual asset trading and financing, while the mainland excels in digital payments and AI. Cyberport, a Hong Kong government-backed technology hub, aims to work more closely with the mainland to develop cryptocurrencies and Web3. The Solana Foundation is investing heavily in China's developer ecosystem, seeking collaboration in decentralized payments and AI. China's massive payments industry makes it a valuable region for cryptocurrency development.</p>

Veterans groups criticized Collins' action as an attempt to deny veterans their day in court.
