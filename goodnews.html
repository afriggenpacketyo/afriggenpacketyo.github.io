          <p>SK Hynix, a South Korean memory chipmaker and key supplier for Nvidia, announced it is ready for mass production of its HBM4 chips, the next generation of high-bandwidth memory used in AI computing. The company has completed internal validation and quality assurance for HBM4, which boasts doubled bandwidth and 40% increased power efficiency compared to the previous generation. These chips are expected to be crucial for Nvidia's upcoming Rubin architecture, solidifying SK Hynix's position in the HBM market, and the company anticipates securing around 50% of the HBM market share by 2026. The announcement caused SK Hynix shares to surge, reflecting strong demand from the AI sector and confidence in the company's continued leadership. Optimism around SK Hynix's position in the AI memory market is high.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following a 0.4% expansion in June, according to the Office for National Statistics. This flatlining aligns with economists' expectations of a slowdown in the latter half of 2025, driven by a correction in trade-fronting, stockpiling, and public sector spending. The stagnation presents a challenge for Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the Autumn Budget, where she aims to ensure spending is funded by tax receipts and lower UK debt. The Bank of England is also grappling with persistent inflation, adding to the fiscal uncertainty, though a rate cut is still expected in November. The economic outlook for the UK remains uncertain.</p>

With the aim of fostering favorable relations, the royals will utilize their soft power through grand state occasions and displays of British tradition. King Charles previously offered Trump a second state visit, which was well-received by the president, underscoring the monarchy's unique appeal. The British government hopes the royal charm offensive will strengthen defense and security ties with Washington, reinforcing the UK's diplomatic efforts on the global stage. The monarchy's influence remains a valuable asset in international relations.</p>

          <p>Over 300 South Korean workers detained during an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia have returned to South Korea, raising concerns about US investment. The workers' departure was briefly delayed by the White House, prompting South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to express bewilderment and warn of potential hesitancy among companies considering US investments. Hyundai CEO José Muñoz stated the raid would delay the factory's opening by several months, while South Korea is negotiating with the US for visa options for Korean workers. The event has strained relations between the two countries, with calls for cooperation to repair any damage to their alliance. The situation has raised questions about the balance between immigration enforcement and international investment.</p>
