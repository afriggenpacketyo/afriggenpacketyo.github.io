        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has identified the genetic mutation responsible for the orange coloration in cats, solving a long-standing mystery in feline genetics. Scientists at Stanford University and Japan‚Äôs Kyushu University conducted separate studies, both published in Current Biology, revealing that orange cats inherit their coloring differently from other mammals. The Stanford team collected DNA samples from hundreds of cats, partnering with cat owners and spay-neuter clinics to locate a specific alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange mutation. This mutation activates the gene in pigment cells, affecting hormonal signaling in a way that differs from red hair in humans, providing insights into broader cellular processes.</p>
