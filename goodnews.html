          <h2>Pregnant Women Advised to Avoid Weight-Loss Injections</h2>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying for a baby, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are concerns about the potential harm these medicines could cause to unborn babies, as it is currently unknown whether they pose risks. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) recommends women use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before attempting pregnancy, and they are also concerned about the safety of these medicines being bought online without medical advice. This advice aims to ensure the safety of both mothers and their children amidst the growing popularity of these drugs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has nominated Vice Adm. Brad Cooper to lead U.S. Central Command, replacing Gen. Michael "Erik" Kurilla, who is retiring. Cooper, who previously led naval forces for CENTCOM, oversaw strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen and helped build a humanitarian pier off the coast of Gaza. Trump also nominated Air Force Lt. Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson to lead U.S. Africa Command, replacing Gen. Michael Langley. Trump has stated his goal to quickly restore stability in the Middle East, but the war in Gaza and ongoing tensions with Iran present challenges.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, whose nomination for NASA was withdrawn by President Donald Trump, said his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience." Isaacman, who founded Shift4, was planning to leave the company if his nomination was confirmed, but it never progressed. Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" as the reason for withdrawing the nomination, and Isaacman suggested that Elon Musk's exit from his government service work and criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill may have influenced the decision. Isaacman will be succeeded as CEO of Shift4 by Taylor Lauber.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of Saint Catherine's Monastery, which is part of the Greek Orthodox church. This commitment came after an Egyptian court ruling sparked alarm among Orthodox Christian leaders over the fate of the historic monastery. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area, despite ruling that the land is public. Greece and Egypt agreed to work together to protect the monastery's rights and legal status, and the monastery holds immense religious and historical significance.</p>

          <p>A dust plume originating from the Sahara Desert is expected to intensify over Florida on Thursday. This plume, which has traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, may later spread as far as Texas and Georgia as a weather system breaks it apart.
