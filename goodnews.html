          <p>Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley announced his decision not to play in next month's tournament, prioritizing his leadership role despite his personal desire to compete. The 39-year-old golfer admitted the absence "hurts" but stressed the immense honor and demands of being captain, a role he considers the "ultimate job in golf." Bradley's form had briefly made him consider a player-captain role, but the complexities of managing pairings, strategy, and team dynamics ultimately led him to focus solely on captaincy. This article details his reasoning and the implications for the American team.</p>

The company's revenue increased 24% year-over-year, driven by a 29% rise in sales for its cloud database service, MongoDB Atlas. CEO Dev Ittycheria attributed this growth to acquiring over 5,000 new customers, particularly AI-native companies, and a successful strategy of focusing on larger enterprises.

          <p>Cracker Barrel faced significant public furor and a nearly $100 million drop in market value after unveiling a new logo that removed its iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure. Following widespread criticism, including a public urging from President Trump, the restaurant chain quickly decided to scrap the new design and revert to its original, acknowledging a misstep in its brand refresh. Marketing experts attributed the backlash to the company's failure to respect its heritage and customers' emotional investment in its folksy image.

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report strong fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts projecting 53% year-over-year revenue growth, further solidifying its position as the world's most valuable company. This growth is primarily fueled by insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the generative artificial intelligence sector, particularly within its data center business. Key questions for the earnings call include the performance of its new Blackwell chips and the state of its business in China, especially after recent export controls and calls for homegrown chips.
