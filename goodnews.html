          <p>Skomer Island, off the Pembrokeshire coast, has recorded a record high of 43,626 puffins, a notable conservation success story amid global population declines. The island's isolation protects the birds from predators and human impact, contributing to its thriving puffin population, as well as supporting other seabird species. Conservationists attribute the growth to an abundance of food and a lack of predators on the island, which is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales. Despite this local success, puffins remain vulnerable to extinction globally due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>

          <p>Japan has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets companies producing over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually across various industries, estimating they account for 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies receive emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for exceeding their limits from those with surpluses. This incentivizes emissions reduction, though companies may pass decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>

While the organizers maintain the events are strictly fantasy, many participants draw inspiration from the real-world conflict, sometimes purchasing surplus military gear from Ukraine's battlefields. The events provide camaraderie and mentorship, but ethical concerns arise regarding the use of "trophy" uniforms from an ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only as one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public, but also for its high level of insider selling. Existing shareholders are selling more shares (60%) than the company itself (40%), a rare occurrence in tech IPOs, reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. While Circle is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, the decision likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. This trend underscores the challenges faced by tech investors seeking exits in the current market environment. (not investment advice)</p>
