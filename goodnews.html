          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 22:11:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, reflecting the ongoing electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. The funds will primarily support CATL's new factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. CATL has faced challenges, including a revenue drop due to intense competition in China's EV market and scrutiny from the U.S. Pentagon over alleged ties to China's military.</p>

          <p>President Trump awarded the first-ever Medal of Sacrifice to three Florida deputies posthumously honored for their service. The deputies were killed when they were struck by an SUV while working to restore one of their motorcycles on the shoulder of the road. Eric Trump, who was heavily involved in making the medals become a reality, said the idea came to him while at a service for the officers. Family members and law enforcement representing each of the victims accepted the awards on their behalf.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in seven months, as a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions provide room for monetary easing. The 1-year loan prime rate was trimmed to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move is part of a broader package of stimulus measures aimed at shoring up the economy, including reductions to deposit rates and the amount of cash banks must hold in reserves. Analysts expect further easing policies from the PBOC, with forecasts of additional lending rate cuts by year-end. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent UK-EU deal, while intended to improve trading ties, underscores the persistent complexities in their relationship post-Brexit. The agreement, praised by the government as a "reset," aims to reduce trade frictions, but significant details, timelines, and costs remain to be negotiated. Some Brexiteers criticize the deal for accepting "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, sacrificing some sovereignty for easier trade. The ongoing negotiations will determine the financial impact, defense cooperation, youth travel, and mutual recognition of professional qualifications, highlighting the UK's continued uneasy relationship with its European neighbors.</p>

          <p>The Woods, a West Hollywood cannabis dispensary co-owned by Woody Harrelson and Bill Maher, was burglarized early Saturday morning. Five men broke the front window and stole cannabis products before fleeing in a black sedan. The break-in occurred two days after a suspected attempted burglary at Erba Markets, a dispensary with the same co-founders as The Woods, though it is unclear whether the incidents are connected. Authorities are investigating the incident, and a security camera video shows the suspects ransacking the store.</p>

The legislation aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. While some Democrats like Sen. Mark Warner supported the measure as a "meaningful step forward," others, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, raised concerns about consumer risks and potential corruption. The bill moved forward with a 66-32 vote after negotiations addressed some, but not all, of the initial concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to halt construction on the Empire Wind farm off Long Island, allowing the $5 billion project to resume after a month-long delay. Governor Kathy Hochul negotiated with President Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to lift the order, which had threatened to kill over 1,000 jobs and jeopardize New York's renewable energy goals. Equinor, the Norwegian energy giant building the wind farm, will now proceed with the project, aiming for completion by 2027. The administration's initial halt had been criticized for lacking evidence and potentially violating legal norms.</p>

The law, championed by First Lady Melania Trump, makes it a federal crime to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without consent and requires websites to remove such material within 48 hours. While praised as a victory for protecting children, the act has faced criticism from free speech advocates who argue it could lead to censorship and government monitoring of private communications.</p>
