          <p>Texas Roadhouse has surpassed Olive Garden as the number one casual dining destination in the United States based on systemwide sales, according to Technomic data. In 2024, Texas Roadhouse sales surged 14.7% to $5.5 billion, while Olive Garden's sales rose only 0.8% to $5.2 billion. The article notes that steakhouses are increasingly popular, with LongHorn Steakhouse also climbing in the rankings. Olive Garden attempted to attract more customers with deals like $6 take-home entr√©es and endless soup or salad and breadsticks, but Texas Roadhouse opened more new locations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce new legislation to overhaul the prison system in England and Wales, aiming to alleviate severe overcrowding. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licenses will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This move is expected to free up around 1,400 prison places, buying time for ministers to implement more comprehensive reforms. Mahmood warned that without these changes, the government would face running out of spaces for male offenders by November, despite plans to build three new prisons this year funded by a ¬£4.7 billion capital investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent executive order by President Trump aims to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. by tying them to lower prices abroad, reigniting debate about the high costs faced by American patients. The U.S. consistently pays more for prescription drugs than other high-income countries, almost three times the average of 33 other nations. This disparity is attributed to the complex U.S. reimbursement system and the absence of national pricing controls. While Americans pay more for branded drugs, generic drugs are often cheaper in the U.S., accounting for 90% of prescription volumes. </p>

          <p>Hearing aids are becoming more accessible and technologically advanced, with new options like glasses that double as hearing aids and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) gaining popularity. The article highlights Nuance glasses, which integrate microphones and beam-forming speakers into the frame, costing significantly less than traditional prescription hearing aids. Additionally, devices like AirPods Pro 2 are now being utilized as hearing aids through software updates. Experts emphasize the importance of addressing hearing loss early to mitigate social isolation and cognitive decline, though adjusting to any hearing aid takes time and effort.</p>

          <p>A large blind taste test conducted by Nectar, a nonprofit researching alternative protein, evaluated 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, comparing them to animal meat benchmarks. Twenty of the plant-based products earned a "Tasty award," indicating that at least half of the participants rated them equal to or better than their animal-based counterparts. The article highlights top performers like Impossible Foods, MorningStar Farms, and Tofurky, noting that differences in taste become less significant when the products are prepared in a meal.

          <h2>Trump Administration Lifts Sanctions on Syria, Hopes for Economic Rebound</h2>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift U.S. sanctions on Syria has sparked hope for economic improvement in the war-torn country. Lifting sanctions is seen as crucial for the new government to rebuild the economy, which has been decimated by war and isolated from the global economy. Trump also met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara, urging him to reach a peace accord with Israel and expel foreign terrorists. While the move is expected to boost the economy, it could take time for individual Syrians to feel the difference.</p>

          <h2>David Souter, Supreme Court Justice Appointed by Bush, Dies at 85</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 11:21:49 EDT</div>

          <p>David H. Souter, the Supreme Court Justice appointed by George H.W. Bush, has died at age 85. Initially considered a conservative appointment, Souter confounded expectations by often siding with the court's liberal wing, notably in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which upheld abortion rights. Souter's commitment to stare decisis and his resistance to the court's shift to the right cemented his position as a liberal voice. He retired in 2009, enabling Barack Obama to appoint Sonia Sotomayor, and is remembered for his common sense and avoidance of Washington society.</p>

          <h2>US Soccer's New Kits Generate Mixed Reactions</h2>

          <p>The US Soccer team's new kits have generated mixed reactions, with the primary kit, dubbed the ‚ÄúBrilliant Kit,‚Äù being compared to the 1994 men‚Äôs denim kit. Some appreciate the retro feel and tribute to past generations, while others find it reminiscent of patriotic napkins. The away kit, the ‚ÄúHeartbeat Kit,‚Äù is described as a blend of heritage and street style, though some question its connection to the passionate soccer community. Overall, the collection is considered decent, but not among the best in US kit history.</p>
