          <p>A federal judge in Boston temporarily blocked the Trump administration's ban on Harvard University enrolling international students. This decision came hours after Harvard filed a lawsuit challenging the ban, which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) justified by alleging that Harvard tolerated "anti-American, pro-terrorist agitators" on campus. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard demonstrated it would suffer immediate and irreparable injury without the restraining order, allowing international students to remain enrolled pending a court hearing. The lawsuit calls the revocation a "blatant violation of the First Amendment" and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

The intersection is partially barricaded, impacting local businesses and prompting lawsuits against the city.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued an order temporarily allowing President Trump to fire officials protected from summary termination, but it also signaled a reluctance to extend this power to members of the Federal Reserve. The order suggests the Court may be unwilling to allow Trump to disrupt the Fed's ability to make independent decisions about interest rates. The Court's Republican majority appears committed to the "unitary executive" theory, which posits that the president should have full control over officials executing federal laws, but it seems to recognize the potential economic chaos that could result from politicizing the Fed.</p>

Tax relief strategies, such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, and Currently Not Collectible status, can help resolve debt and halt garnishment.

If wages are already being garnished, verifying the debt and contacting the IRS or a tax relief specialist is recommended to negotiate a resolution or demonstrate financial hardship.
