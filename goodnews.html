          <h2>Researchers Discover Roses Were Likely Yellow, Not Red, in Ancient Times</h2>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that roses, often associated with the color red, were initially yellow. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to determine the traits of their common ancestor. The research team concluded that the original rose likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow color and seven leaflets, challenging the modern perception of roses as predominantly pink or red.</p>

          <p>In a guest essay, Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu highlight China's rapid advancements in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that the United States is always ahead. China has effectively disseminated, commercialized, and manufactured tech, positioning itself at parity or even ahead in areas like AI. The article notes China's success in developing competitive AI models, exemplified by DeepSeek's V3 large language model. The authors argue that the U.S. must learn from China's open-source approach and accelerate its own AI innovation to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place, according to preliminary data. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline was attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years due to resumed development projects. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for promoting a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>

The issue was cited by 21.9% of respondents as their top concern.

The removal of public trash bins is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks, leading to littering in tourist spots becoming a major issue.</p>
