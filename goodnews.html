          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 2-1 walk-off victory in the 11th inning against the Philadelphia Phillies, propelling them to the National League Championship Series. The decisive play unfolded when Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering committed a shocking throwing error with the bases loaded, allowing Hyeseong Kim to score the winning run. This Game 4, initially a gripping pitchers' duel between Tyler Glasnow and Cristopher Sánchez, evolved into a tense bullpen battle, with both teams exchanging runs in the seventh. The Dodgers' ability to rally and their strong relief pitching ultimately sealed their 3-1 series win in an unforgettable playoff contest.</p>

          <p>Shares of prominent South Korean chipmakers, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, surged to unprecedented record highs on Friday, following a holiday break. This significant market rally was primarily fueled by a series of high-profile deals and investments within the booming artificial intelligence sector. SK Hynix experienced a notable 10% increase, while Samsung Electronics climbed nearly 6%, both benefiting from the ripple effects of a potential OpenAI and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) partnership. This positive trend reflects a broader industry confidence, further bolstered by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's confirmation of rising demand and strategic investments in AI startups. The strong performance of these companies highlights the profound financial impact of AI advancements on global technology markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is anticipated to announce her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week, setting the stage for a high-stakes challenge against incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, has been a key recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and her entry will intensify an expanding primary field. This race is deemed critical for Democrats, representing a significant opportunity to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and contest the current Republican Senate majority, despite a generally challenging midterm election landscape. Mills previously garnered national attention for a public confrontation with President Trump regarding transgender sports policies, highlighting her willingness to engage on contentious issues.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi's victory in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party leadership race signifies a profound ideological shift for the nation, potentially moving away from the centrist pragmatism of the Shinzo Abe and Fumio Kishida eras. As the prospective first female prime minister, her rise heralds a staunch conservative and nationalist agenda. Domestically, Takaichi aims to revitalize the economy with a protectionist approach, prioritizing state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology, though this risks increasing Japan's already substantial public debt. For Japan's economic partners, particularly in Southeast Asia, her policies are expected to deepen "friendshoring" initiatives but will likely intertwine economic aid and investment with geopolitical alignment, potentially creating new demands for countries maintaining neutrality.</p>

Developed by a collaboration of four EA-owned studios, the project aims to overcome past criticisms by integrating early fan feedback and reintroducing a single-player campaign. Despite the game's massive scale and substantial financial investment, developers convey confidence in its potential, citing "explosively positive" feedback from preview weekends. The article also notes the controversial, though preparatory, use of generative AI in development and the recent acquisition of EA by a Saudi-led group, which developers assert will not impact the game's planned trajectory.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a crucial package of legislation designed to bolster and enhance oversight of the California FAIR Plan, the state's property insurer of last resort. The FAIR Plan, which provides coverage to property owners unable to secure it elsewhere, suffered an estimated $4 billion in losses from January's wildfires, necessitating assessments on member carriers and a proposed 36% rate increase. The new laws empower the plan to issue bonds and access lines of credit for catastrophic claims, while also adding legislative representatives to its governing committee to improve transparency. These reforms aim to stabilize California's insurance market, making it more resilient against the escalating threat of climate-fueled firestorms and ensuring more equitable claim processing.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have formally agreed to the "first phase" of a 20-point peace plan, marking a significant development two years into the conflict. This initial stage mandates an immediate ceasefire, Israel's withdrawal to a predefined line, and the release of all 20 remaining live hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, with the return of deceased hostages' bodies to follow. In reciprocity, Israel is set to release approximately 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees, while also facilitating the daily delivery of substantial humanitarian aid to Gaza. A multinational force, under U.S. military oversight but without U.S. ground troops in Gaza, will be deployed to monitor the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 576 into law, which prohibits streaming services, including major platforms like Netflix and Prime Video, from broadcasting commercials at volumes significantly louder than their programming. This landmark legislation effectively closes a loophole in the federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act of 2010, which previously did not apply to digital streaming platforms. The bill was inspired by new parents whose baby was frequently awakened by jarringly loud ads, addressing a widespread consumer frustration. Despite initial opposition from the powerful Motion Picture Association, the bill passed unanimously, showcasing California's capacity to influence national standards, with the new restrictions set to commence on July 1, 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A nearly complete skeleton unearthed on Dorset's Jurassic Coast has been definitively identified as a new and unique species of ichthyosaur, a prehistoric marine reptile, now named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "sword dragon of Dorset." This dolphin-sized "sword dragon," dating back approximately 185 million years, exhibits several distinct features, including a remarkably long, sword-like snout and a unique prong-like bone near its nostril, previously unobserved in other ichthyosaur species. Scientists theorize the specimen likely perished from a severe bite to the head, possibly inflicted by a much larger ichthyosaur, with additional malformations in its limb bones and teeth suggesting pre-existing injury or disease. This significant discovery fills a crucial gap in the evolutionary understanding of ichthyosaurs from a period with scarce fossil records.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Assembly Bill 867 into law, effectively banning the elective declawing of cats across the state, a practice widely condemned as inhumane by lawmakers and animal welfare advocates. This legislation prohibits veterinarians from performing the procedure, which involves amputating the first bone of each toe, unless it is deemed medically necessary to address a recurring infection or a health-jeopardizing condition. The new law seeks to eliminate a practice that has increasingly fallen out of favor among veterinary professionals and is already outlawed in numerous California cities and other countries. While proponents highlight the chronic pain and behavioral issues caused by declawing, opponents voiced concerns about limiting veterinary scope and the potential for pet abandonment if owners exhaust all other alternatives.</p>

U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas ruled that, within the context of a rap battle, a "reasonable listener" would not have concluded that Lamar's criticisms, including claims about Drake's preferences, conveyed objective facts. Drake had contended that UMG endangered his life by depicting him as a pedophile and sought to devalue his music ahead of contract renegotiations. UMG welcomed the dismissal, asserting the suit was "an affront to all artists," while Drake's representatives confirmed plans to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has enacted a series of animal welfare bills designed to significantly restrict puppy sales and strengthen protections for buyers, spurred by a Los Angeles Times investigation into deceptive breeding practices. The new legislation prohibits online marketplaces used by brokers who sell commercially bred dogs, voids pet purchase contracts that include nonrefundable deposits, and mandates the public disclosure of health certificates. These measures address loopholes that surfaced after California's 2019 ban on pet store sales of commercially bred animals, which inadvertently led to a rise in online resellers often concealing the actual origins of puppies. The overarching goal of this legislation is to enhance transparency in pet sales and actively combat the proliferation of animals from out-of-state puppy mills.</p>
