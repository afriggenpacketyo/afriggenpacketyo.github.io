          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, including shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Equinox from Mexico to the United States. This move comes as trade talks between the Trump administration and Mexico show little progress, with tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts already in effect. GM CEO Mary Barra stated that the investment demonstrates the company's commitment to building vehicles in the U.S. and supporting American jobs. The investment will enable GM to assemble over two million vehicles annually in the U.S. (not investment advice) The optimism score for this article is 70.</p>

          <p>In a world saturated with AI-generated content, the ability to discern what is meaningful and resonant is more valuable than ever. Taste, defined as judgment with style, allows leaders to make decisions that feel fitting and elevate utility with elegance. AI can generate infinite variations, but it lacks the human discretion, cultural intuition, and lived experience necessary for true taste. Cultivating taste requires exposure, curation, and reflection, making it a competitive advantage and an ethical necessity for leaders. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>
