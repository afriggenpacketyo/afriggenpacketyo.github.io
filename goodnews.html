          <p>Global equities experienced modest gains as investors assessed President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, alongside increasing weariness towards U.S. policymaking. The MSCI World index saw a slight increase, while U.S. futures also edged higher. Market sentiment remained relatively subdued, potentially indicating a growing desensitization to American policy shifts. According to Hugh Dive, the markets are responding less dramatically to policy changes due to elements of the market becoming jaded and the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes, reflecting a winding back of alarming headlines moves in tariffs that has seen subsequent shocks lessened.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Western airlines face greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, coupled with U.S. military strikes, which forces carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are at a disadvantage because they remain barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to utilize it, giving them more flexibility in rerouting flights. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Tehran's missile assault on an American military base in Qatar, with Western firms diverting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan, as well as southern routes over Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The competitive gap between Chinese and Western airlines may widen as travelers, especially those from China, prioritize airfare and flight times.</p>

          <p>The Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in the Hebrides after owning it for 80 years, since the Dowager Viscountess Selby purchased it after World War II. The 1,000-acre island, featuring a ruined castle, working farm, and holiday accommodation business, is listed for ¬£5.5 million. Jim Gully described his childhood on the island as idyllic, with white sand beaches and rocky coves, and the family has managed the island for generations, including running holiday cottages and a farm. The castle on the island was built in 1911 by George Alexander MacLean Buckley, but fell into ruins in the 1980s due to upkeep costs, and Sotheby's International Realty suggests the island could become a "wellness destination".</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which promises hardware acceleration for AI and data centers. The chip achieves a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling Nvidia's advanced GPUs. This development comes as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and U.S. export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. The advancement of optical computing is critical for overcoming barriers such as heat build-up, quantum effects, and unsustainable power consumption.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both decreased, falling below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran on June 13. The market sell-off indicates investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following U.S. strikes on Iran, with some analysts suggesting President Trump is employing a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which he said allowed for the prevention of any loss of life, and called for peace.</p>

Net borrowing will also significantly increase, jumping to ‚Ç¨81.8 billion in 2025, facilitated by a recent law easing Germany's debt brake.

This development follows a day of heightened tensions, with Iran retaliating for the U.S. strikes, though reports indicate no American casualties or damage occurred.
