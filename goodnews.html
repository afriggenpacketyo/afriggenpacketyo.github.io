          <p>Nvidia has received approval from the Trump administration to sell its advanced H20 AI computer chips to China, reversing a previous ban. CEO Jensen Huang announced the policy shift, highlighting the importance of the Chinese market for American tech competitiveness. The decision is seen as a significant boost for Nvidia, allowing it to better compete with rivals like Huawei and potentially easing trade frictions. This development comes as the U.S. has been tightening controls on advanced technology exports to China over national security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst estimates, driven by strong performance in its fixed income trading and investment banking divisions. The bank's revenue from these sectors benefited from market volatility related to U.S. trade policy shifts. Despite a 17% drop in overall earnings compared to the previous year, the underlying results were robust. CEO Jamie Dimon noted the U.S. economy's resilience but also warned of persistent risks from trade uncertainty and geopolitical conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree Robotics, Wang Xingxing, has called for collaboration between Chinese and American companies to advance the development of humanoid robots. Speaking at a government press conference, he argued that combining China's manufacturing and hardware strengths with the U.S.'s rich AI software ecosystem would benefit the global industry. This call for cooperation comes as humanoid robotics emerges as a new area of technological competition between the two nations. The push highlights the private sector's growing role in Chinese innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Shetland Islands are exploring a major infrastructure project to replace their aging ferry system with a network of undersea tunnels connecting several islands. Proponents of the plan point to the Faroe Islands, which have successfully connected their archipelago with numerous tunnels, boosting their economy and population. The Faroese model, funded by borrowing and paid back with tolls, is seen as a viable path for Shetland. The project could be transformational for local industries like salmon farming and the Saxavord Spaceport, though questions remain about funding and local acceptance.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a new grant scheme to reduce the cost of new electric cars by up to £3,750, aiming to accelerate the shift from petrol and diesel vehicles. The discounts will apply to eligible cars priced up to £37,000 and will be funded by a £650 million program over three years. While the government hopes this will boost EV adoption ahead of the 2030 ban on new fossil fuel car sales, critics and industry figures stress the urgent need for more public charging infrastructure. The opposition has criticized the policy as forcing families into more expensive vehicles.</p>

          <p>A writer recounts their personal journey of leaving the conservative evangelical church in order to embrace their identity as a gay Christian. The essay reflects on the Southern Baptist Convention's continued opposition to same-sex marriage, a stance that forces many LGBTQ individuals to choose between their faith community and their personal integrity. The author describes the painful process of leaving a beloved but non-affirming church, ultimately finding a deeper and more authentic faith in a community that embraces them fully. The piece argues for the religious liberty of Christians who affirm queer identities.</p>

          <p>A pastor and divinity school professor argues that houses of worship should not endorse political candidates, despite a recent IRS rule change allowing them to do so. The author contends that while churches must address moral and political issues like justice, endorsing specific candidates undermines the conscience of congregants and reduces the church's role. Doing so risks turning sanctuaries into politically polarized spaces and entangling them in partisan wars. The essay concludes that the church best serves the state by maintaining its distinct moral authority rather than becoming a tool for political ends.</p>
