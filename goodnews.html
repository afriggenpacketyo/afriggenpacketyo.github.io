        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government announced it has rescinded its planned digital services tax, a move aimed at restarting trade discussions with the United States. This decision came after President Donald Trump declared he was terminating all trade talks with Canada in response to the proposed tax, which would have primarily affected American technology firms. Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump have now agreed to resume negotiations. The goal is to reach a comprehensive trade arrangement by a new deadline of July 21, 2025, signaling a de-escalation in the recent trade dispute between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more prevalent, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are linking to the unique characteristics of EV operation. Studies indicate that the smooth, rapid acceleration and the distinct deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems can provoke queasiness. Regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into electrical energy to charge the battery, creates low-frequency deceleration patterns that are a key trigger for motion sickness symptoms. This article explores the science behind this issue and potential solutions being developed to enhance passenger comfort in the new era of transportation.</p>

          <p>As Pride Month drew to a close, LGBTQ+ communities and their allies held parades and demonstrations in cities across the globe, from New York to Budapest. The events combined joyful celebration with pointed protest, highlighting ongoing fights for rights and inclusion amid a rising tide of political attacks in the U.S. and other nations. New York City's march, themed "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorated the 1969 Stonewall Uprising and saw large crowds demonstrating against policies targeting transgender people. In Budapest, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events, underscoring the global struggle for equality.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The decision to resume imports follows an agreement reached in May between the two Asian nations to begin the necessary procedures for restarting trade. While the ban has been lifted, it is expected to take a few months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of Japanese seafood to China can fully resume.</p>

          <p>A young male mountain lion cub that suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull, after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's wildlife center undertook a nearly five-month rehabilitation process to nurse the cub back to health. A key challenge was providing intensive medical care while ensuring the animal did not become habituated to humans, thereby preserving its wild instincts. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released into a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains.</p>
