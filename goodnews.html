          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of his peace plan, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and an initial Israeli troop withdrawal. This article highlights Trump's significant personal investment and political leverage in compelling both sides to agree, particularly Hamas to release hostages upfront through pressure on regional allies. While this initial phase addresses the immediate hostage crisis, it does not yet resolve deeper, underlying conflict issues such as Hamas's disarmament or the future governance of Gaza. Trump aims to capitalize on this momentum and his influence to push for a broader, lasting peace, despite considerable challenges that still lie ahead.</p>

          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has taken to social media to directly reassure her fans, humorously declaring "I ain't dead yet!" amidst swirling health rumors. The widespread concerns arose after her sister, Freida Parton, made remarks that some interpreted as indicating a terminal condition for the beloved singer. Parton, 79, who had previously postponed a series of shows due to unspecified health issues, appeared in a video from a shoot, stating she was working hard and emphatically not done yet. This article clarifies that she is undergoing treatment after neglecting herself following her long-time husband Carl Dean's death, aiming to definitively dispel the anxieties of her global fanbase.</p>

          <p>SoftBank shares surged by 13% following its agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, further advancing SoftBank's AI footprint. This article highlights the deal as a significant strategic step in SoftBank's expansion into "Physical AI," aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's ambitious vision of Artificial Super Intelligence. The acquisition means ABB will no longer pursue spinning off its robotics business as a separately listed company. SoftBank, already a major player with holdings in chip designer Arm and a significant stake in OpenAI, continues to position itself at the forefront of the global AI boom through such strategic investments and acquisitions.

          <p>Hang Seng Bank shares soared by 29.5% after its parent company, HSBC, announced a proposal to take it private, valuing the lender at over $37 billion (290 billion Hong Kong dollars). HSBC, Europe's largest lender and already owning about 63% of Hang Seng Bank, aims to acquire the remaining shares at HK$155 apiece, representing a significant 33% premium over recent trading averages. This article highlights HSBC's stated goal to strengthen its presence in Hong Kong and its role as a "super-connector" between international markets and mainland China. The strategic move seeks to address governance issues inherent in parent-subsidiary double listings, despite Hang Seng Bank's recent uptick in bad loans tied to real estate.

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the "first Phase" of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces. This article confirms the significant diplomatic breakthrough through corroborating statements from Trump, Qatari officials, Israeli Prime Prime Minister Netanyahu, and Hamas. Trump indicated that hostages could be released as early as Monday, with the deal requiring approval from the Israeli cabinet on Thursday. While this represents a crucial step towards de-escalation and addressing the immediate humanitarian crisis, the agreement's long-term implications for Gaza's governance, security, and the broader Israeli-Palestinian conflict remain to be fully determined.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Greater Bay Area, encompassing Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou, should seize the transformative opportunity to host the Olympic Games. The author contends that an Olympic bid could foster unprecedented community integration and inspire youth, transcending existing infrastructure and commercial ties. By unifying these distinct communities through the shared spirit of sports, the Games could effectively dismantle physical and cultural barriers, allowing residents to move more freely and collaborate more often. This ambitious vision aims to enhance social cohesion, champion health initiatives, and instill profound regional pride, ultimately redefining the area's future presence on the global stage.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party has seen its paid-up membership almost halve in the last five years, falling from nearly 118,000 in 2020 to 60,000, according to BBC analysis of available figures. This article notes this significant decline occurred despite the party achieving its most successful general election in terms of seats won last year. Experts suggest that while electoral success might typically boost membership, the Liberal Democrats' current lack of a clear path to government may be a contributing factor to the decrease. In contrast, the Green Party of England and Wales reported a significant surge in its membership, now reaching 90,000 members.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed explanation of President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly backed. The comprehensive proposal calls for an immediate end to fighting, Hamas to release all remaining hostages within 72 hours, and Israel to begin a phased troop withdrawal from parts of the Gaza Strip. It outlines a new "technocratic" Palestinian committee and an "International Stabilization Force" backed by Arab states to govern Gaza, effectively sidelining both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. The plan also addresses critical aid delivery, economic development, and frames Palestinian statehood as an "aspiration," while ruling out Israeli annexation of territory.</p>
