          <p>Nvidia announced first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations, propelled by a substantial 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company anticipates approximately $45 billion in sales for the upcoming quarter, slightly below estimates due to export restrictions on China-bound H20 chips. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. companies because of these restrictions, impacting their Hopper data center business in the region. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's overall growth remains strong, fueled by the increasing demand for AI chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has discontinued the requirement for civilian employees to submit weekly emails outlining five accomplishments, an initiative partly influenced by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Employees were instructed to send a final email suggesting potential cost-cutting measures within the Pentagon. The initiative was implemented to provide leaders with insights into employee contributions and identify opportunities for improved efficiency. This change aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to reduce the size of the federal civilian workforce, potentially leading to the departure of over 50,000 Defense Department employees.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended his tariff strategy, rejecting the critique that he often backs down from implementing announced tariffs, a pattern derisively labeled the "TACO trade." Trump asserted that his tariff threats are a negotiation tactic that has helped the U.S. gain ground in trade talks, particularly with the European Union. He cited the EU's willingness to meet after the U.S. threatened a 50% tariff, which was later delayed, as evidence of the strategy's effectiveness. Trump criticized the question about chickening out as nasty, emphasizing that his moves are part of a broader negotiation process.</p>
