        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reveals a 46% increase in cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older between 2021 and 2023. Many seniors are turning to marijuana, often in the form of edibles, to address medical issues like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety, viewing it as a viable alternative amid diminishing social stigma. However, some medical professionals express concern, citing research that links THC consumption to heightened cardiovascular risks, including heart disease and stroke. The article highlights the growing debate between personal relief and potential health consequences for this demographic.</p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is establishing a new transit center and a dedicated shipping service dubbed the "durian express" to accelerate the delivery of the popular fruit from Southeast Asia. This initiative by Liaoning Port Group aims to reduce shipping times from nearly two weeks to as little as six days, ensuring fresher products for the region's 100 million consumers. The project addresses the logistical challenges of supplying durians to a market that is geographically distant from traditional entry points like Guangzhou or Shenzhen. This development seeks to tap into the growing demand for the fruit in a previously underpenetrated part of the country.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's upcoming state visit to the United Kingdom will be accompanied by a major security operation, including round-the-clock police drone surveillance over Windsor. King Charles is set to host the U.S. president at Windsor Castle, prompting Thames Valley police to implement a temporary airspace restriction from September 16 to 18. This order will prohibit non-police drones and small aircraft from flying in the area to ensure security during the high-profile event. The operation is described as one of the larger security efforts undertaken by the force, reflecting the significant resources allocated for the visit amid planned protests.</p>

          <p>England's head cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has pushed back against what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions surrounding the team's aggressive style of play, often dubbed "Bazball." He argues that the perception of his team as simply swinging the bat recklessly without a clear strategy undermines the hard work and determination of the players. McCullum clarified that his coaching philosophy is not about a rigid, high-risk approach but about creating an environment that allows players to perform without being restricted by the pressure of international cricket. He emphasized that the ultimate goal remains winning by enabling players to express their natural talent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term after his Labour Party emerged as the leader in the country's parliamentary election with approximately 28% of the vote. Despite a reduced majority, his left-leaning coalition secured 87 of the 169 seats, just enough to remain in power. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as inflation and public services, but was also influenced by international instability. The populist Progress Party on the right also saw significant gains, doubling its support from the 2021 election and signaling a growing right-wing sentiment in the country.</p>

Clarke emphasized that while it's a solid start, the team must now focus on upcoming home matches against Greece and Belarus to build on their momentum. The results have renewed hopes among fans that Scotland could qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 28 years, with a strategy built on strong defense.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues Recent Wall Street Pessimism on Tech Giants Was Overstated</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that many recent fears surrounding major tech companies on Wall Street have proven to be overblown. He pointed to concerns about a potential breakup of Alphabet, which did not materialize, and anxieties over Amazon's cloud services and Apple's AI strategy, which the market has since moved past. Cramer argued that a negative narrative is easy to create but often ignores when the feared outcomes do not occur. He also expressed confidence in Nvidia's long-term performance despite a recent price target cut, suggesting it will likely be seen as another misguided pessimistic call in hindsight.

          <p>China has achieved significant environmental improvements over the past two decades, reducing air and water pollution even as its industrial base has grown. According to the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, the average annual level of PM2.5 air pollutants fell by over 35% nationwide between 2015 and 2022. This progress is attributed not to deindustrialization, but to a strategy of "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." The approach relies heavily on deploying advanced green technologies, implementing real-time environmental monitoring, and making massive investments in sustainable infrastructure to combat pollution at its source.</p>

          <p>Shares of Nebius Group, a provider of Nvidia graphics chips for AI, skyrocketed after the company announced a five-year agreement with Microsoft potentially worth up to $19.4 billion. Under the deal, the Amsterdam-based company will supply significant computing resources to Microsoft from a data center in New Jersey to help meet the massive demand for AI workloads. This move reflects a broader trend of major tech companies turning to third-party infrastructure providers to address the shortage of AI-capable cloud capacity. The deal has more than doubled Nebius's market value this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The new funding, led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, places Cognition among the elite AI startups valued at over $10 billion.

          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen is opening up about his past, stating he felt "held hostage" by secrets and potential blackmail related to his private life. In promoting his new memoir, Sheen discussed how his past drug addiction led to sexual encounters he paid to keep private, and how he used alcohol to cope with a stutter. He also reflected on the "tremendous relief" of publicly disclosing his HIV-positive diagnosis in 2015 after others had threatened to expose it. Now sober for eight years, Sheen says he wants to be vulnerable and own his stories to free himself from the past.</p>
