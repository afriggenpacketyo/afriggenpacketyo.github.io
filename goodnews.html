          <p>The Dallas Mavericks have selected 18-year-old Cooper Flagg with the first overall pick in the NBA Draft, making him their new franchise cornerstone. Flagg, a standout forward from Duke University, was the consensus college player of the year after leading his team to the Final Four. He joins a talented Mavericks roster that includes Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving. The selection of Flagg is seen as a pivotal moment for the franchise as it moves forward from the recent trade of Luka Doncic.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris won the Austrian Grand Prix, marking his third victory of the season and narrowing the championship gap with his teammate, Oscar Piastri. The win was a crucial confidence booster for Norris, who successfully managed intense pressure from Piastri throughout the race. The victory follows a difficult period for Norris, including a retirement in the previous race in Canada. Norris credited his recent success to increased off-track work and technical adjustments made to the car to improve his feel and performance.</p>

          <p>Lionel Messi's Inter Miami suffered a 4-0 defeat to his former club, Paris St-Germain, in what might have been the 38-year-old star's final game in a global tournament. While his team was outmatched, Messi still displayed moments of his signature skill, though his best days are clearly behind him. With his Inter Miami contract ending in 2025 and his participation in the 2026 World Cup uncertain, speculation is growing about the future of the Argentine legend. This match was the first time in his extensive career that he played against a former team.</p>

          <p>The film "F1 The Movie" has become a significant box office hit for Apple, earning an estimated $55.6 million in its North American debut and $144 million globally. This marks the tech company's most successful theatrical opening to date, a notable achievement following mixed results from previous film ventures like "Napoleon" and "Argylle." Produced by the team behind "Top Gun: Maverick" and starring Brad Pitt, the movie's strong critical reviews and positive audience reception suggest it may have sustained success despite its large production budget of over $200 million.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced in a recent interview that he has found a group of "very wealthy people" prepared to purchase the social media app TikTok. This development comes as the deadline for parent company ByteDance to sell the platform, which was banned in the U.S. over national security concerns, has been extended to September 17. A previous deal to sell TikTok to an American buyer fell through, but Trump expressed confidence that the Chinese government would likely approve this new potential sale. The identity of the prospective buyer has not yet been revealed.</p>

Feeling disrespected and that her boxing career was stagnating due to political interests, the 31-year-old fighter has decided to transition to MMA, where she has already had a successful debut, to seek the opportunities she feels were denied to her in boxing.</p>

The new film, directed by Gareth Edwards, introduces a new cast led by Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey.

The original "Jurassic Park" from 1993 was a cultural and technical milestone, and this latest entry aims to continue its legacy, though early reviews have been mixed, ranging from a "roaring triumph" to a "string of forgettable scenes."</p>
