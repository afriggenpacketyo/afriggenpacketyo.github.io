          <p>Justin Halstenberg, a Norco man, has been convicted of intentionally starting the Line fire that burned approximately 44,000 acres in the San Bernardino Mountains. The fire injured six firefighters and forced the evacuation of over 11,000 residents, damaging several properties. Prosecutors presented evidence that Halstenberg practiced starting fires and used a similar ignition device at the start of the Line fire. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison for aggravated arson and related charges, sending a message that arsonists will be held accountable for their destructive actions.</p>
