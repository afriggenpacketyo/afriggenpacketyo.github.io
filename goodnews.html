          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated the central bank is nearing the end of its balance sheet reduction program, a process known as quantitative tightening. He suggested that a softening labor market is increasing the risks to employment, which could warrant future interest rate cuts to balance economic stability with inflation control. Powell emphasized the delicate task of navigating these risks, noting that while no specific timeline for rate cuts was given, the Fed is closely monitoring economic indicators to guide its upcoming policy decisions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll has outlined a modernization plan where every infantry soldier will be equipped with a personal drone, drawing lessons from their effective use in conflicts like Ukraine. Speaking at the Association of the United States Army conference, he emphasized that drones and counter-drone technologies are critical for future battlefield dominance. The Army is also developing mini "Iron Domes" using drone sensor networks and is pursuing the Janus Program to deploy small nuclear microreactors at bases for energy self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights a significant values gap between Gen Z job seekers and hiring managers, potentially hindering employment opportunities for the younger generation. Gen Z prioritizes self-care and authenticity, while employers seek achievement and hard work, with only 2% of young workers sharing their bosses' top values. The article advises Gen Zers to be honest about their financial goals and consider strategically adopting more traditional work values for a period to secure employment and build a career, even if it means temporarily suppressing personal priorities.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released the inflation-adjusted tax brackets for 2026, revealing higher income limits for investors to qualify for the 0% long-term capital gains tax rate. For 2026, single filers with taxable income up to $49,450 and married couples filing jointly with up to $98,900 can pay no taxes on gains from assets held for more than a year. Financial experts suggest this provides a significant opportunity for investors to rebalance their portfolios or harvest gains without incurring a tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>
