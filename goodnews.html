          <p>In a remarkable act of compassion, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from Utah has raised over $300,000 for the family of the gunman who attacked a Michigan chapel, killing four people. David Butler started the crowdfunding campaign after learning the deceased suspect left behind a wife and children, including one with a chronic illness. Citing his faith's teaching to "love our enemies" and care for widows and orphans, Butler sought to help a family he saw as additional victims of the tragedy. The campaign far exceeded its initial $10,000 goal, drawing support primarily from other members of the faith.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors now hold approximately US$21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen returns of 42% this year, tracking the metal's significant price increase. Financial analysts from several major banks predict that gold prices could continue to climb, potentially reaching over US$4,000 an ounce in the next year. This rally is attributed to several factors, including robust demand from global central banks seeking to diversify reserves, a weaker U.S. dollar, and ongoing geopolitical risks. The strong performance of gold provides a stark contrast to other market trends and highlights its role as a hedge against economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The annual Formula One race in Singapore is providing a significant economic boost not just to the city-state but to the entire Asia-Pacific region, according to travel data. Analysis of flight bookings shows that international attendees are frequently pairing the race with trips to other destinations, such as Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia. This trend of "event-stacking" turns the Grand Prix into a regional tourism driver, as visitors extend their stays to explore nearby countries. The event has also evolved into a week-long affair, attracting business leaders to related conferences and drawing a growing number of leisure and family travelers.</p>

This marks the second consecutive season that Detroit has won a Wild Card Series away from home. The team will now face the AL West champion Seattle Mariners in the next round of the playoffs.

The new design replaces previous backgrounds with images of California's redwoods, poppies, and coastline. Key security upgrades include a first-in-the-nation digital signature embedded in one of the two barcodes on the back of the card, while the old magnetic strip has been removed. DMV officials have assured the public that current licenses remain valid until their expiration date, and there is no need to seek an early replacement for the new version.</p>

          <p>After a demanding summer playing for the Slovenian national team in the EuroBasket tournament, Lakers star Luka Doncic is deliberately easing into training camp to manage his physical load and prevent injuries. The team's coaching staff, led by JJ Redick, supports this slower approach, emphasizing the importance of being in peak condition for the long regular season. Despite the measured pace, Doncic's performance in early drills has already impressed his teammates with his creativity and court vision. The camp's focus is on building both physical and mental readiness for the upcoming NBA season.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to reduce the cost of its drugs in the United States to match the lower prices it charges in other developed countries. This concession, a long-sought goal for President Trump, was achieved after the administration threatened to impose 100% tariffs on drug companies that did not comply with its pricing demands. As part of the agreement, Pfizer will also participate in a new government website, TrumpRx, offering certain drugs at steep discounts. While the immediate financial relief for patients is still unclear, the deal marks a significant symbolic victory in the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug costs.</p>

          <p>This article traces the history of college rankings in the United States, from a controversial and quickly suppressed federal report in 1911 to the influential annual list published by U.S. News & World Report today. Early attempts to classify universities were met with institutional outrage, but the landscape shifted as higher education became a mass-consumer good in the latter half of the 20th century. By the 1980s, the demand for a guide to the American meritocracy created fertile ground for rankings to become a cultural staple. The essay argues these lists have profoundly shaped public perception and institutional behavior, often reflecting societal anxieties more than objective educational quality.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that focusing solely on stagnation in China's economy overlooks a profound transformation being driven by a new generation of entrepreneurs. Born in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, this cohort is described as technically trained, innovation-focused, and adept at co-creation with government and global partners. Unlike their predecessors who often relied on informal networks, these business leaders are leveraging technology and market opportunities to drive competitiveness at scale. The article suggests this entrepreneurial dynamism is a key, often undervalued, aspect of China's economic resilience and ongoing restructuring.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace has achieved the longest unbeaten run in its 120-year history, extending the streak to 19 games with a victory over Dynamo Kyiv in the Conference League. This accomplishment marks a dramatic turnaround for the club, which was battling relegation just one year ago but now sits third in the Premier League and holds the FA Cup. Manager Oliver Glasner praised his players as "hungry" and "ambitious," and their record-setting form includes impressive results against top teams like Liverpool and Manchester City. The achievement places them on one of the longest active unbeaten streaks among Europe's top five leagues.</p>

          <p>A team of divers has discovered over 1,000 Spanish silver and gold coins, estimated to be worth $1 million, off Florida's "treasure coast." The coins were recovered from the wreckage of a Spanish fleet that was destroyed by a hurricane on July 31, 1715, while transporting wealth from the colonies back to Spain. The salvage company, 1715 Fleet-Queens Jewels LLC, noted that many of the coins still have visible dates and mint marks from their origins in what are now Bolivia, Mexico, and Peru. This discovery provides a tangible link to the history of the Spanish empire's golden age.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the history of Lucumí, also known as Santería, tracing its origins as a spiritual practice of survival and resistance developed by enslaved Yoruba people in Cuba. The essay aims to demystify the religion, explaining its core tenets of balance, health, and connection to nature through deities called orishas. Scholars featured in the piece argue that widespread, negative stereotypes about the religion, particularly concerning practices like animal sacrifice, are rooted in colonial and anti-Black efforts to demonize African traditions. The religion is presented not as "black magic," but as a system for collective healing and remembrance.</p>

          <p>In a notably open interview with actor Eugene Levy, the Prince of Wales has stated that "change is on my agenda" for when he becomes king. Prince William emphasized that while he respects tradition, he is not "suffocated" by history and believes in making changes to keep the monarchy relevant and impactful. He also spoke candidly about the personal strain his family has experienced over the past year with both his father's and his wife's cancer diagnoses. The conversation, which took place at Windsor Castle and a nearby pub, is being described by palace sources as one of the most revealing glimpses into his vision for the future.</p>
