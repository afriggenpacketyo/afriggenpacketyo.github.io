          <p>As China develops its 15th five-year plan, a key focus is addressing the urgent financial needs of local governments. Recent actions, such as a crackdown on undeclared overseas income, highlight the central government's efforts to boost revenue. This clampdown has seen wealthy individuals hit with substantial back taxes and late fees, signaling a broader enforcement of existing tax laws. The article examines how the upcoming plan could provide solutions to these local-level financial challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The TFFF, developed with World Bank support, aims to reward nations for preserving tropical forests by investing in low-risk assets and channeling returns to tropical countries, with payments contingent on keeping deforestation below 0.5%. Brazil's President Lula da Silva, who announced a $1 billion contribution from Brazil, emphasized it as an investment in humanity and the planet, urging other nations to make ambitious pledges.

          <p>The Liberal Democrats, led by Sir Ed Davey, are employing a "punchy" and aggressive strategy, heavily focusing on Reform UK leader Nigel Farage. This approach serves as a call to action for activists, aiming to boost funding and recruitment by presenting themselves as the clearest alternative to Reform and Donald Trump. Despite Reform denying claims about gun law changes, the Lib Dems are using past remarks to hold Farage accountable. The party seeks to extend its appeal to disaffected Conservative voters, acknowledging the challenge posed by Reform's rise in a competitive political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a significant shift in his stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, stating in a social media post that Ukraine, with European Union support, is positioned to "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form."

          <p>The White House is demanding an investigation into an escalator at the UN that abruptly halted as President Trump and the First Lady stepped on it, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt threatening firings and investigations if it was intentional. A UN official, however, attributed the stop to a person traveling with Trump inadvertently hitting the lever. Trump used the incident, along with a faulty teleprompter, to mock the UN during his General Assembly speech, questioning the organization's purpose and lamenting its construction.</p>
