          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) plans to establish an "international operations centre" for the digital yuan to enhance the renminbi's global influence, according to Governor Pan Gongsheng. This initiative is part of eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, which also include piloting structural monetary policy tools in Shanghai. These measures are being implemented amid growing trade and technology tensions with the United States, driving China's efforts to promote overseas adoption of the yuan and strengthen Shanghai as a global financial hub. The trials will incorporate refinancing schemes for foreign trade enterprises and an expanded green finance programme. Optimism surrounding the yuan's future impact is moderate given the global economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia Democrats have selected Chris Jones as their nominee for attorney general in the upcoming off-year elections, aiming to regain control of state government. Jones will face Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares in November, while the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor remains undecided. Abigail Spanberger will run for governor against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears. Virginia's elections are closely watched as indicators of national sentiment before midterm elections, with analysts assessing voter attitudes toward President Trump and the Republican-controlled Washington. While Democrats have history on their side, the state has become more competitive, making the upcoming elections crucial. The political landscape has become increasingly precarious with the nation divided. </p>

This initiative marks the first agreement signed since the annual Lujiazui Forum began in 2008, emphasizing the importance of Hong Kong and Shanghai in China's financial reforms and the 'go global' drive by mainland companies.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their identified gender and still select "X" on passport applications. The executive order, issued by President Trump, reversed a policy under the Biden administration that allowed self-selection of gender and included an "X" for non-binary individuals. The ACLU sued the Trump administration, claiming the policy was discriminatory. The ruling has been praised by LGBTQ+ advocates and criticized by the White House, with the Justice Department appealing the decision. This is a major win for the LGBTQ+ community, resulting in a rise in optimism. </p>

          <p>Former Trump administration border czar Tom Homan asserts that President Trump's policies have resulted in the most secure border in U.S. history. Homan cited a record low of 95 illegal immigrant encounters in a single day, contrasting this with the Biden administration's higher numbers. He also highlighted that under Trump, virtually no illegal immigrants were released into the U.S., unlike under Biden. Homan advocates for the passage of the "Big Beautiful Bill" to solidify these gains and implement a large-scale deportation operation.

          <p>Chinese companies in the booming humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with more experienced engineers earning up to 38,489 yuan. This high pay stands out in a subdued hiring landscape, where the job market is under pressure from slowing economic growth. The youth unemployment rate has eased slightly, but a record number of graduates entering the workforce this summer is expected to strain the labor market further. The high salaries signal a positive outlook for the robotics sector, resulting in a rise in optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, finding that many could find new homes in the North Sea. The study indicates that mobile species will cope better, while static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle. The analysis should guide the government in planning how to protect species as their habitats change. The prospect of marine life thriving has caused a rise in optimism. </p>
