          <p>Brazilian police successfully thwarted a planned bomb attack targeting Lady Gaga's free concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro, which drew over two million attendees. The suspects, who identified as Lady Gaga fans, were arrested and face charges related to spreading hate speech against children, adolescents, and the LGBTQ+ community. The group also allegedly promoted radicalization among teenagers, including self-harm and violent content. Authorities seized electronic devices and materials during search warrants across multiple states, ensuring the safety of the concert, which was intended to revitalize Rio's economy with an expected $100 million boost.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling eligible students to use taxpayer funds for private school tuition. The bill allocates $10,000 per year for most private school students, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for parental choice and educational freedom, while Democrats argue that it will siphon crucial funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier families. Attorney General Ken Paxton stated that the bill ensures students can seek educational options that meet their needs, while critics like State Representative Jolanda Jones labeled it 'welfare for the wealthy'.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Starbase, the South Texas home of SpaceX, is nearing official city status following a local vote largely supported by SpaceX employees. The move grants the company greater control over the area, including managing roads, utilities, and potentially closing Boca Chica Beach for launch operations. Critics express concerns over Musk's increased influence and potential restrictions on public access to the beach, while SpaceX argues that city authority would streamline launch procedures. The city, about 1.5 square miles, seeks permission for increased launch activity, up to 25 launches annually, sparking debate over environmental impact and public access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The expiration of a de minimis tariff exemption is set to increase prices on cheaper goods from China for U.S. consumers. Ultra-low cost retailers like Shein and Temu previously relied on this loophole, which allowed packages worth under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, giving them a competitive edge. With the end of the exemption, goods from China will be subject to tariffs, potentially leading to higher prices and reduced variety for consumers. Experts also anticipate administrative challenges and potential delays due to increased inspections by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Companies selling goods made in the U.S. may benefit from reduced competition.</p>

Sanders, initially projected as a top pick, fell to the fifth round, with the analyst citing his decision not to participate in the NFL Scouting Combine or the East-West Shrine Game as a mistake. The analyst also stated that Sanders was overrated as a player based on his talents and tools. Sanders will now compete for a starting job with the Cleveland Browns, against other quarterbacks on the roster.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his plans to step down, marking the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Buffett's success was built on value investing, buying wonderful businesses at fair prices, turning a failing textile manufacturer into a diverse empire. Over six decades, he acquired companies like BNSF railroad and Geico, amassing a personal fortune of $168 billion and earning global admiration. His approach, influenced by Benjamin Graham and Charles Munger, involved meticulous research and long-term investments, with Berkshire's cash pile reaching nearly $348 billion. Buffett's successor, Gregory Abel, is seen as a capable operator, though some worry about Berkshire's future without its iconic leader. (not investment advice)</p>
