          <p>Trentham Monkey Forest in Staffordshire has announced the birth of three Barbary macaque monkeys, an endangered species with fewer than 8,000 believed to live in the wild. Staff at the sanctuary expressed their delight at the new arrivals, which were discovered during morning feeding rounds. The park, home to 140 Barbary macaques, anticipates more births during its "baby season" and collaborates with organizations dedicated to protecting wild macaques in Morocco and Algeria. The births highlight the sanctuary's efforts to raise awareness about the endangered status of the species and contribute to their conservation. The news is generally positive, as it indicates successful breeding efforts for an endangered species.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology firms are increasingly engaging in mega drug-licensing deals with multinational pharmaceutical companies, driven by cost savings and the desire to avoid selling shares amid depressed valuations. These deals often utilize a "newco structure," combining traditional intellectual property licensing with fundraising through newly established corporate entities. CSPC Pharmaceutical Group recently announced potential multibillion-dollar licensing deals for its drug candidates, causing its shares to surge. This trend reflects a strategic shift in the Chinese biotech industry towards leveraging intellectual property to attract foreign investment and expertise. The increase in such deals suggests growing confidence in Chinese biotech innovation and potential for global partnerships.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to initiate steps to resume imports of Japanese seafood, reversing a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. This agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and is expected to involve a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese processing facilities. While some restrictions on food imports from specific Japanese prefectures remain, this move is seen as a positive step towards resolving tensions between the two countries. Japanese fishermen and businesses have welcomed the announcement, hoping for a smooth expansion of exports. This development indicates a potential thaw in relations between China and Japan.</p>

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the agency's last remaining crypto enforcement actions. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal symbolizes a shift in regulatory approach towards the crypto industry, particularly as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the sector. Binance, the world's largest digital assets exchange, has recently formed ties with projects linked to the Trump family, indicating a potential shift in the political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency regulation. The end of the lawsuit suggests a more favorable environment for crypto businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan has stated it will not purchase defense equipment from the United States in exchange for the easing of tariff measures, emphasizing that tariff negotiations and security issues are separate matters. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani clarified that defense equipment purchases will be based on national security needs, not trade negotiations. This stance comes ahead of a fourth round of bilateral trade talks. Japan's chief tariff negotiator had previously suggested that defense equipment purchases could help reduce the trade deficit.
