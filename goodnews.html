          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that the company anticipates a reduction in its corporate workforce over the next few years due to the increasing integration of generative artificial intelligence tools. Jassy emphasized the need for employees to adapt and learn how to leverage AI to enhance efficiency and streamline teamwork. This announcement follows Amazon's layoff of over 27,000 employees since 2022, with further cuts made this year in its North America stores and devices and services units. Amazon is currently deploying generative AI across its internal operations, including its fulfillment network, to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and warehouse robot efficiency. </p>

Nearly 90% of Kraft Heinz's U.S. products are already free of synthetic dyes, with the company investing in removing dyes from remaining products or replacing them with natural colors. This decision follows federal health officials' plans to voluntarily phase out petroleum-based food dyes, addressing concerns about their potential negative effects on children's behavior and mental health.

          <p>The Orkney Islands Council has ended its two-year investigation into the possibility of leaving the UK, determining that the proposals were too difficult and expensive. The council explored various models for greater autonomy, including changing their status within the UK or becoming a self-governing territory of Norway. The investigation was prompted by frustration with the financial support received from both the Westminster and Holyrood governments. The council will now focus on investigating a single authority model to reform public services.</p>

          <p>George Gountas, a New York City father and "Daily Show" lighting designer, won a Pedro Pascal look-alike contest, securing $50 and a year's worth of burritos. Gountas' wife, who noticed the resemblance years ago, encouraged him to enter the contest, where he beat over 20 competitors. He plans to maintain his Pascal-inspired look, despite some family resistance, and hopes to meet the actor someday. Gountas used his prize money to treat his family to ice cream.</p>
