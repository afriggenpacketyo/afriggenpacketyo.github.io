          <p>The Los Angeles City Council publicly rebuked City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto, voting 12-0 to direct her to withdraw her request to lift a federal judge's order. This order prohibits LAPD officers from targeting journalists with crowd control weapons during protests, a ban Feldstein Soto had argued was overly broad and jeopardized public safety. Council members expressed growing frustration with the city attorney's office, emphasizing the crucial importance of protecting journalists' First Amendment rights, especially amid past accusations of excessive force against protesters. This action underscores the council's commitment to oversight and accountability, challenging the city attorney's independent legal maneuvers.</p>

          <p>A viral phrase, "6-7," originating from Philadelphia rapper Skrilla's song "Doot Doot (6 7)," is causing widespread disruption and amusement in classrooms across the country. Despite lacking a clear meaning, the phrase has become a pervasive generational code word, amplified by social media and appearances in popular culture, including "Abbot Elementary" and "South Park." Teachers and school administrators are grappling with its constant use, with some adopting strategies like allowing students to express it or saying it themselves to make it less appealing. This trend highlights how digital platforms can quickly spread and sustain seemingly nonsensical youth fads, often frustrating adults while providing a sense of community for kids.</p>

          <p>Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, has publicly apologized for his earlier comments supporting President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco for public safety. Benioff stated that after listening closely to local officials and his fellow San Franciscans, he no longer believes the National Guard is necessary. His initial remarks, made from "an abundance of caution" ahead of his company's Dreamforce conference, had drawn significant backlash from critics and led to comedians canceling performances. This retraction and apology indicate a de-escalation of political tension and reinforce the city's stance that local leaders have crime under control.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have reduced the felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer against California labor leader David Huerta to a misdemeanor for allegedly obstructing ICE agents. Huerta was arrested during immigration raids for reportedly blocking federal authorities from serving a warrant at a Los Angeles workplace. His attorneys argue he is being targeted for his advocacy and outspoken criticism of the administration's immigration policies, asserting he was exercising his First Amendment rights. The reduction in charges, following acquittals in similar misdemeanor trials, offers a partial reprieve for the prominent union president, though he remains committed to seeking full vindication at trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals exciting results for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. The trial, involving 25,000 adults from North America, identified cancer in 62% of positive cases, with more than half detected at early, more treatable stages. The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative results and significantly increased overall cancer detection when combined with existing screenings. While these impressive results suggest a major role in earlier diagnosis, scientists await further evidence from a large NHS trial to confirm whether the blood test ultimately reduces deaths from cancer.</p>

          <p>Northampton Saints ascended to the top of the Prem table with a decisive 36-19 victory over Newcastle Red Bulls, who continue their league winless streak dating back to last November. Despite playing a man down for half an hour due to two sin-bins, Saints secured a bonus-point win with five tries, showcasing their resilience and strategic depth. Newcastle, while showing flashes of defiance and narrowing the gap twice, ultimately failed to capitalize on their opportunities to secure a much-needed victory.
