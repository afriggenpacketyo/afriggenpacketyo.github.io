          <p>This opinion article asserts that China's long-term energy strategy, backed by political stability, is rapidly accelerating its clean energy transition. Western media note China's growing dominance as an "electrostate," contrasting it with the U.S. pivot towards fossil fuels. China aims to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, having significantly increased renewable energy's share since 2021. The article highlights China's consistent policy and massive infrastructure projects as key to its low-carbon future.</p>
