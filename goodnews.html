          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national inquiry into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS to families who have suffered avoidable harm and stated that the investigation would ensure accountability and truth for these families. The review will involve victims of maternity scandals and is expected to report back by December 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies suggest that while heavy drinking is undoubtedly harmful, the health effects of moderate alcohol consumption are more nuanced. Experts agree that excessive drinking poses significant risks, with negative consequences increasing exponentially beyond one or two drinks per sitting. While some research indicates potential cardiovascular benefits from very modest alcohol intake, doctors generally advise against starting to drink for health reasons. The focus should be on understanding and adhering to what constitutes moderate drinking to avoid dependency and carcinogenic risks.</p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms for the first time since March, reaching 3,920 yen, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries reported the decrease, with Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributing it to the release of additional rice reserves. The market share of blended rice, including reserve rice, has risen to 50 percent, and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to bring the average retail price down to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June.

          <p>Japan has initiated mandatory pre-arrival tuberculosis (TB) screening for foreign nationals planning to stay longer than three months, starting with residents from the Philippines and Nepal. This measure aims to address the increasing number of foreign nationals diagnosed with TB in Japan, primarily from these countries. Individuals will need to provide evidence of being TB-free before entering Japan or face denial of entry. While TB is curable and preventable, it remains a significant global health concern, with an estimated 1.25 million deaths in 2023.</p>
