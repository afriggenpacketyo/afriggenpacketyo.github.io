          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, with an EPS of 83 cents versus the anticipated 50 cents, but revenue fell slightly short at $11.53 billion compared to the expected $11.62 billion. Despite this, the company reported a net income of $1.78 billion, a significant increase from the previous year's net loss of $654 million. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi highlighted strong growth in Uber Eats and the increasing adoption of Uber One subscriptions, while also addressing the FTC lawsuit regarding deceptive billing practices. Uber is also expanding its autonomous vehicle technology, reaching an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips and partnering with Waymo in Austin, Texas, where Waymo vehicles are operating at a high capacity.</p>

          <p>Senator Susan Collins, now chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, faces increasing pressure to challenge President Trump's policies, particularly after budgetary attacks on her home state of Maine. Despite her position of power, Collins has been criticized for not fully utilizing the appropriations committee to counteract Trump's actions. While she has publicly opposed some of Trump's policies and voted to impeach him, she is perceived as hesitant to engage in direct confrontation, leading to concerns about her ability to effectively represent Maine's interests. The senator's actions are being closely watched as she navigates the balance between challenging the administration and maintaining her influence within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed electronic warfare devices capable of creating the illusion of a fleet of warships from a single vessel. The technology, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, involves networked 1-bit jammers that send signals to deceive advanced radar systems. This could trick enemy missiles into targeting these 'ghost' fleets, allowing real warships to evade detection. The development comes from the Beijing Research Institute of Telemetry, an aerospace defense contractor, and suggests a new strategy for naval warfare using electronic deception.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, is advocating for a change to the offside rule to favor attackers and increase goal-scoring opportunities. The proposed change would consider a player onside if any part of their body that can legally score a goal is level with the last defender. Wenger draws a comparison to a similar rule adjustment made after the 1990 World Cup, which aimed to encourage more attacking play. He believes that the current use of VAR has eliminated the advantage previously given to strikers, leading to frustration among fans.</p>
