        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Superstar pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers following a protracted four-month contract dispute. The Packers secured Parsons, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history with a four-year, $188 million contract including $136 million guaranteed, by sending two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to Dallas. Parsons, who will don the No. 1 jersey, expressed his ambition to build a legacy befitting the storied Green Bay franchise, aiming to provide crucial star power and a consistent pass rush. This high-stakes acquisition, though potentially leading to future salary cap complexities, is viewed as a transformative move for the Packers' competitive outlook.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men aged 18 to 22 to cross national borders unhindered, a policy change aimed at providing broader opportunities for education, internships, and legal employment abroad. Previously, men aged 18-60 were generally prohibited from leaving due to potential military conscription, though the draft primarily targeted those 25 and older. Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko stated the goal is to equip young Ukrainians with international experience for future national development. While some demographers express concern about a potential brain drain, officials believe the impact on demographics will not be critical, as many who wished to leave have already done so.</p>

This victory makes him the oldest man to reach the last 16 at the US Open since Jimmy Connors in 1991, and he also tied Roger Federer's record of 69 Grand Slam fourth-round appearances. Despite struggling with lower back discomfort and requiring a medical timeout during the match, Djokovic showcased supreme serving and relentless depth to overcome Norrie's aggressive play.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., Jia Cobb, has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to expand speedy deportations of undocumented migrants in the U.S. interior. The ruling is a setback for President Trump's goal of one million deportations annually, with the judge arguing that the expanded use of expedited removal tramples on individuals' due process rights. Previously, this fast-track process was limited to migrants near the border who had been in the country less than 14 days. Cobb's decision emphasizes that due process must be afforded to all, regardless of entry status, in such removal proceedings.</p>

          <p>American Taylor Townsend delivered a career-best performance at the US Open, upsetting No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 to reach the fourth round, equaling her best major result. This victory comes after a public controversy where opponent Jelena Ostapenko allegedly made "no class" comments, which Townsend interpreted as racially charged. Supported by players like Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka, Townsend asserted she is "made for this type of stuff," drawing strength from standing in her truth. Her resilience echoes a past USTA fitness dispute, proving her power to make a singles mark on the sport's biggest stage.</p>

          <p>A baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, which earned him a suspension for a celebratory bat flip, has sold for nearly $10,000 at auction. All proceeds from the signed bat will be donated to Haddonfield Little League, the program Marco plays for, demonstrating his love for the sport and desire to give back. The bat flip incident, which occurred during a sectional tournament final, led to an ejection, a one-game suspension, and a legal battle that Marco's father won. The story garnered national attention, with major leaguers supporting the boy and the event even commemorated at the Little League World Series.</p>

They surpassed the previous record of 162 days despite enduring violent tropical storms, during one of which Lachlan was swept overboard but secured by a safety line. The brothers, who previously rowed the Atlantic, undertook this epic challenge to raise £1 million for clean water projects in Madagascar, having already collected over £700,000. They are now reunited with family in Australia, looking forward to pizza and a proper night's sleep.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile section of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains in 2022 and 2023 caused slope failures and pavement collapse, further exacerbated by the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. Hikers welcome the increased access to popular trails, which is also expected to reduce overcrowding. However, the reopening coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for Angeles National Forest, raising concerns about public adherence to safety regulations.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Police Department employee accidentally shot themselves at City Hall East, sustaining a graze wound from their personal firearm. The incident led to the immediate cordoning off of the building's lobby and entrance by officers.

Internal Affairs investigators are handling the matter. City Hall East houses offices for the city attorney and controller, and the incident occurred at a desk, prompting questions about firearm safety protocols in government buildings.</p>

          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, driven by both retail and overseas investors seeking better alternatives and underpinned by the nation's immense US$22 trillion savings. Investment director Jian Shi Cortesi anticipates further stock upticks, citing investors' rotation from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation in areas like advanced manufacturing and AI. With major global stock markets at historical highs, Chinese equities are seen as offering "undervalued innovation" and significant room for growth. This positive sentiment follows years of underperformance and a recent return of foreign capital, positioning China's market for continued strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, upholding a lower court's decision. The Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension. The court emphasized that the TPS statute was designed for predictability and insulation from political shifts. This decision offers a path for potentially undoing the administration's actions, which had already led to job losses, detentions, and deportations for some of the affected Venezuelans.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, has gone viral due to her animated responses and lawyers' questions about her appearance. Cardi B denied physically attacking Emani Ellis, claiming the guard invaded her privacy by filming her during a pregnancy appointment and then engaged in a verbal altercation. Moments from the trial, including questions about her wigs and fingernails, sparked amusement and debate online, with some questioning potential racist or misogynistic undertones. The trial is expected to conclude next week, with social media amplifying the courtroom drama.</p>
