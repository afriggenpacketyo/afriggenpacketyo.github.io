          <p>President Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, solidifying Ciattarelli's position in the Republican primary. Ciattarelli, who previously distanced himself from Trump, has now openly sought the president's support. The endorsement could be a double-edged sword, given New Jersey's Democratic lean and Trump's polarizing image. The endorsement came less than about an hour before a debate among five of the six prominent Democrats vying for the nomination.</p>

          <p>Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months. The 21-year-old had been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023. Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire deal ahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The Palestinian Authority has lifted its ban on Al Jazeera in the West Bank, which was imposed in January due to accusations of 'inciting sedition' and 'interfering in internal Palestinian affairs.' The authority offered scant information about why it issued the ban in January, and it maintained that stance in announcing that it was rescinding it. The ban on Al Jazeera followed similar actions by the Israeli authorities. Last May, Israel ordered it to shut down in the country.</p>

          <p>News of a US agreement with China to temporarily ease tariffs sent stocks soaring on Monday. The S&P 500 rose 3.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average leapt 2.8%. Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs by 115%, according to the White House. That will bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% from as high as 145%, and China's rate on American goods down to 10% from 125%. The 10% baseline tariff and other U.S. measures will remain in place.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump‚Äôs Hollywood ambassadors, including actor Jon Voight, joined labor unions and major studios in asking the US president to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions. In a letter addressed to Trump on Sunday, the studios and unions did not mention his threat to introduce 100% tariffs on films made abroad, but instead thanked him for supporting the industry through their ‚Äúshared goal‚Äù of domestic production. The letter also calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill being drafted by Congress that it argues would ‚Äúimmediately make America more competitive, expand the American media industry, brings jobs back to America, and support the independent spirit of American business‚Äù.</p>
