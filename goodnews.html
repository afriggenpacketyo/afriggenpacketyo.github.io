          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius indicated that compulsory military service could be reintroduced if voluntary enlistment fails to meet the country's defense needs. The new military service model will initially rely on volunteers, but the government is preparing legislation to allow for mandatory recruitment as early as 2026. This debate intensifies amid rising concerns about Germany's national defense readiness and the evolving security landscape in Europe, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Germany suspended its draft in 2011 but has since struggled to meet troop targets, making the potential reinstatement a significant policy shift.</p>

The messages warn drivers of unpaid fees on traffic violations and threaten steep penalties, including additional fines and suspension of driving privileges if the reader does not comply. These phishing scams by text, otherwise known as "smishing," or SMS phishing, have been on the rise in recent months.

Panahi, the winner of the 2025 Palme d'Or, has had little choice.

That didn't stop him. The movie tells the story of a group of ex-prisoners who believe they've found the man who tortured them ‚Äî and must decide whether to exact revenge.</p>
