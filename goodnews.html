          <p>Macy's reported robust fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by revamped stores that boosted sales trends. The department store operator also raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, signaling cautious optimism despite ongoing tariff impacts. CEO Tony Spring emphasized the company's strong market position, aiming to gain share and enhance customer experience with a newer assortment and healthy inventory. This positive financial update, including strong comparable sales growth across all three nameplates like Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, reflects a strategic lean into successful business segments such as denim and women's contemporary apparel.

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged 7% after a U.S. District Judge ruled against the Department of Justice's most severe proposals in Google's antitrust case. While Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, the court rejected demands to divest its Chrome browser or prohibit payments for default search engine status. This decision is viewed as a significant win for Google, removing a major regulatory overhang and bolstering confidence in the long-term durability of its search business. Analysts now anticipate increased stability and growth for Alphabet, especially as Google continues to pin its artificial intelligence hopes on its Gemini suite of AI models and chatbot.

          <p>A theft charge against Parviz Jafari, accused of stealing flowers from tributes to Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham, has been dropped by prosecutors. The decision came after a court was informed that a security guard had granted the 45-year-old permission to take the flowers. Mr. Jafari, from West Bromwich, was told he was free to go during a brief hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. The Crown Prosecution Service concluded there was no realistic prospect of conviction, as dishonesty could not be proven. Thousands of tributes had been left near the Black Sabbath bench and mural following Osbourne's death on July 22, aged 76.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Merging All Domestic Steel Companies to Ensure Financial Viability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 09:11:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is advocating for the merger of all six domestic steel companies into a single entity, citing concerns over the sector's financial viability. With four companies currently receiving state financial support, ministers believe consolidation is essential for long-term sustainability. The Department for Business and Trade prefers a joint commercial buyer over nationalization, requiring the backing of current owners for any future plan. This strategy aims to address major financial difficulties caused by high energy prices, increased tariffs, and global steel oversupply, with the Business Secretary reportedly set to negotiate with Chinese owners of British Steel.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has scheduled the Autumn Budget for Wednesday, November 26, where she will detail the government's tax and spending plans amidst mounting pressure to balance public finances. With sluggish growth and rising inflation, Reeves aims to boost economic growth and maintain investor confidence by investing in the economy and ensuring working people are better off. Despite pledges not to increase VAT, National Insurance, or income tax, speculation about other tax rises, such as a windfall tax on banks, is growing. The Chancellor will work with the Office for Budget Responsibility to produce a new economic forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposed revamp of the County Championship, initially planned for 2026, may be delayed until 2027 or even shelved due to a lack of consensus among the 18 first-class counties. While a reduction in the T20 Blast was agreed upon, proposals to cut the Championship from 14 to 12 matches were opposed by several counties, taking that option off the table. The current choice is between 14 or 13 matches, with discussions ongoing among county chairs. This potential delay reflects a desire to ensure the best possible decision for the sport's domestic structure, especially as the current season concludes next week.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the evolving depiction of children in art throughout history, from their roles in royal marriage politics to religious iconography and eventually as subjects of individual portraits. Art historian Katrin Dyballa highlights how children were initially presented as miniature adults or symbolic figures, with the affluent bourgeoisie later commissioning opulent Baroque-style portraits. The perception of peasant children also shifted, from ridicule to models of humility. The advent of photography further transformed their portrayal, making images more spontaneous, while modern concerns now address children's right to their own image in the digital age. The exhibition "Kids! Between Representation and Reality" will further explore this topic.</p>
