        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its plan to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data with hurricane forecasters. The decision came after scientists and meteorologists expressed alarm, warning that the loss of data could lead to less accurate and timely hurricane predictions, especially during peak season. The Navy now states it will continue providing the data, which is also vital for monitoring polar sea ice and climate change, until the program's scheduled end in 2026. This ensures forecasters have the necessary tools to issue early warnings for dangerous storms.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a 90-day extension for trade negotiations with Mexico, delaying the imposition of broader 30% tariffs that were set to begin. Following a discussion with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the existing agreement, which includes specific tariffs on fentanyl, cars, and metals, will remain in place. This move is part of the administration's strategy to use tariffs as leverage for negotiating more favorable trade deals for the U.S. Economists have raised concerns that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices in the United States.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, significantly reducing the military presence deployed in June to address unrest over immigration raids. The deployment, which California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass called unnecessary and illegal, was intended to protect federal agents and property. Newsom's office stated that President Trump's "political theater backfired," as the troops had a limited role while costing an estimated $134 million. About 250 California Guard members will remain to protect federal facilities.</p>

          <p>A plush monster doll named Labubu, created by the Chinese company Pop Mart, has become a viral sensation and sought-after fashion accessory in the United States. The trend, amplified by celebrities like Blackpink's Lisa and social media, has driven a massive increase in sales and brand recognition for Pop Mart in North America. Analysts describe the collectible doll as a "gateway drug" to the company's other products, with its popularity contributing to a more than 500% surge in Pop Mart's stock price over the past year. The phenomenon highlights a cultural shift where toys are becoming status symbols for adults. (not investment advice)</p>

The study, involving over 13,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes and heart disease, also showed Mounjaro offered a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and better kidney protection. While the primary results were not statistically superior, the company believes the comprehensive benefits strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment. The findings could further solidify Mounjaro's market position as Trulicity's patent expiration approaches.</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not see artificial superintelligence as an imminent threat to the design software company. While acknowledging the long-term potential of AI, Field argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by current AI models trained on public internet data. The company, which recently priced its IPO at $33 per share for a $19.3 billion valuation, is moving forward after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory hurdles.

          <p>The UK's new Labour government has signaled a major foreign policy shift, indicating it could recognize a Palestinian state as early as September if Israel does not meet certain conditions for peace. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that statehood is an "inalienable right" for the Palestinian people, using the threat of recognition as leverage to advance a two-state solution. This change comes amid domestic pressure from protesters and party members, and follows a similar move by France. The decision represents a departure from Britain's long-held position of tying recognition to a final peace deal.</p>

To combat these feelings, the article suggests practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and building a supportive community of peers.
