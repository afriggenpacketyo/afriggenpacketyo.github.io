          <p>President Trump has expressed reservations about the size of a Boeing 747-8 gifted by Qatar, intended as a replacement for Air Force One. Trump stated the plane is "much too big" to be his personal perk, suggesting it would be more suitable for the United States Air Force. The original offer from Qatar drew criticism due to potential impropriety, particularly after Trump's focus on trade deals during his visit to the country. The aircraft is currently being refitted to meet military standards, with the cost of the refitting process remaining unclear.</p>

Vance also encouraged continued political involvement to ensure the industry's interests are represented, highlighting crypto's potential as a hedge against inflation and discriminatory practices.

Despite this, Nvidia reported strong quarterly results, with 69% year-over-year revenue growth. The Trump administration's decision to require an export license for Nvidia's H20 processor for China has significantly impacted the company's sales in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property has been lifted in England, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon heating. This change, part of the government's Warm Homes Plan, simplifies heat pump installation for millions of homes. Consumer groups caution that this doesn't address challenges for renters or leaseholders, and high upfront costs remain a significant barrier. The government aims to upgrade 300,000 households to improve energy efficiency and lower bills through the Warm Homes Plan.</p>
