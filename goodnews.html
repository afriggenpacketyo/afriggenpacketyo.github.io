          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, despite increasing tariffs and other barriers, during a speech at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in China. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and cautioned against turning trade into a political or security issue. Li highlighted the importance of engaging in the international economy to reshape global rules and order, urging countries to stay on the "right" path. Adam Tooze, a history professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's comments as a call for a pluralization of global rules and processes.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led study suggests that an interconnected global solar-wind energy system could meet the world‚Äôs energy demands by 2050, producing three times the needed power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The research explores creating a network that utilizes regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents to areas with high demand. The study acknowledges the need to navigate geopolitical boundaries and crises to establish such a system, but emphasizes that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency and resilience against conflict and climate extremes. The researchers highlight that the potential of solar and wind resources vastly surpasses human demand.</p>

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong showing in the first round, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who conceded the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters and on social media, capitalizing on a progressive, economy-focused platform. Cuomo, who resigned as governor in 2021 after sexual harassment allegations, campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with Donald Trump. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent in the fall.</p>

          <p>Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary, marking a significant political upset. Cuomo, the former governor, was attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist, secured a commanding lead, although falling short of the 50% threshold needed to win outright. Cuomo's concession was unexpected given the ranked-choice system in place, and Mamdani would be the first Muslim and Indian American to lead New York City if elected.</p>

The Climate Change Committee (CCC) emphasizes the need for the government to ensure households benefit from the switch to cleaner technologies through lower bills. The CCC argues that achieving net zero by 2050 is achievable and could lead to long-term economic benefits. While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen significantly, transport and buildings remain major emitters.</p>
