        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a roughly 4% increase following a significant drop in market capitalization, triggered by a public disagreement between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggested that a potential truce between Musk and Trump could benefit Tesla shares, with Wedbush Securities noting the stock was oversold due to the news. However, a White House official stated that Trump was not interested in a call with Musk, adding uncertainty to the situation. The conflict arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to a public exchange of words between the two. The stock market is a volatile and sensitive beast.</p>

          <p>Tom Cruise has secured a Guinness World Record for performing a daring stunt in "Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning," involving jumping from a helicopter and igniting a fuel-soaked parachute. Cruise executed the stunt 16 times, jumping from at least 7,500 feet, and had only three seconds to cut away the flaming parachute and deploy a backup. The stunt, which required holding a 50-pound camera rig, highlights Cruise's commitment to authenticity and pushing the boundaries of action filmmaking. This is Cruise's second Guinness World Record, adding to his box office achievement for consecutive $100-million-grossing movies.</p>

          <p>Joseph Tater, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in Russia in August 2024 and forcibly admitted to a psychiatric hospital, has left the country, according to Russian state media.

During a court hearing, Tater claimed he was being persecuted by the CIA and sought political asylum in Russia. His departure follows the release of other Americans detained in Russia through prisoner swaps, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates by a full percentage point, despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report. Trump argued for the rate cut to boost the economy, even while acknowledging the country is "doing great." The president's public pressure on the central bank chairman is a recurring theme during Trump's second term. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that U.S. hiring decreased less than expected in May, with nonfarm payrolls rising by 139,000, exceeding estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Job growth slowed in May as businesses expressed concerns about the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariff policies. The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the previous month, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%. Federal government employment declined by 22,000 jobs, reflecting efforts to cut federal spending. Despite tariff-related concerns, key economic measures have largely defied fears of a downturn, with the unemployment rate remaining low and inflation cooling. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The operator of Tokyo Disney Resort is considering lowering ticket prices for its theme parks due to increased consumer sensitivity to discretionary spending amid inflation. Oriental Land Co. President Wataru Takahashi indicated the company may adjust prices for Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea, which currently range from 7,900 yen ($55) to 10,900 yen per adult for a one-day ticket. The potential price adjustment coincides with a large-scale redevelopment plan for the parks through fiscal 2035. Takahashi also discussed the company's cruise ship project, slated to begin operating in fiscal 2028, aiming to integrate a theme park and hotel experience at sea.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Donald Trump was overshadowed by the public spat between Trump and Elon Musk, but the meeting was still seen as a win for Merz. Merz's agenda included strengthening relations between the U.S. and Germany, discussing tariffs, and addressing U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO defense spending. Merz gifted Trump his grandfather's birth certificate, emphasizing the family's connection to Germany, and highlighted Germany's plans for increased defense spending. The sensitive topic of Germany's far-right party was seemingly avoided, contributing to a positive outcome for Merz.</p>

          <p>A major cocaine smuggling operation that used a network of speedboats to transport drugs from South America to the Canary Islands has been taken down. Almost four tonnes of cocaine trafficked from Brazil and Colombia were seized and 48 suspects arrested in raids across Fuerteventura, Gran Canaria and Lanzarote. The gang used 11 so-called narco boats to smuggle the drugs across the Atlantic, using an abandoned wreck at sea as a refuelling platform. Police forces from Europe, South America, and the US were involved in the raids, dubbed Operation Black Shadow.</p>
