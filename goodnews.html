        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International reported a record interim net profit of 913.6 million yuan, a 6.4% increase from the previous year. This growth was largely fueled by a marathon boom across China, which significantly boosted sales of its professional running shoe brands, Saucony and Merrell. The professional segment saw a remarkable 32.5% jump in sales, with operating profit more than tripling, validating the company's strategy to fully control the brands' distribution in China. The company's CEO, Ding Shuipo, highlighted the success of their "professional-to-mass" marketing strategy at major marathon events, which has driven brand visibility and sales.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added several new words popularized by social media, including the viral terms "skibidi" and "tradwife." "Skibidi" originated from a YouTube animated series and is defined as a versatile slang word that can mean "cool" or "bad," or be used nonsensically as a joke. "Tradwife" is a portmanteau for "traditional wife," referring to a married woman who embraces traditional gender roles and often documents it online. Other new entries reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device to feign computer activity, highlighting how internet culture is continuously shaping the English language.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously known as the last country without a national soccer team, has officially made its international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support despite a 4-0 loss to the U.S. Virgin Islands. The event was a significant moment of pride and representation for the community, many of whom were displaced by U.S. nuclear testing or emigrated for economic reasons. Despite the loss, the team and fans were jubilant, celebrating the historic milestone and the establishment of a new national identity in the global sports community.</p>

          <p>A fisherman on the Mississippi River in Minnesota has likely solved a nearly 60-year-old cold case after discovering a submerged vehicle with his sonar device. The car, a 1960s-era Buick, was recovered by the Stearns County Sheriff's Office and found to contain human remains. Investigators identified the vehicle as belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in 1967 and was last seen driving his Buick Electra. While the remains await formal identification, authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family, bringing potential closure to a disappearance that has puzzled the community for decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of active short-term rental registrations in Los Angeles has decreased by 6% over the past year, with some data platforms showing even steeper declines in listings. Homeowners are increasingly moving away from platforms like Airbnb and VRBO due to a combination of stricter local ordinances, the threat of significant fines, and the hassles of frequent tenant turnover. Many property owners are instead opting for mid-term rentals—stays longer than 30 days—which offer a more stable income stream with less regulatory risk. The city's plan to increase enforcement, including higher fines and undercover operations, has created a chilling effect, prompting many hosts to exit the market.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Boggs' new biography, "Baldwin: A Love Story," offers a deeply researched look into the life of writer James Baldwin, focusing on how his search for love and identity shaped his literary and activist work. The book delves into his formative relationships, particularly with Lucien Happersberger and the previously undocumented Yoran Cazac, arguing that these complex, often unrequited loves fueled his most powerful fiction, including "Giovanni's Room." Boggs meticulously connects Baldwin's personal experiences with his incisive essays on race in America, showing how his life as a gay Black man abroad gave him the perspective to critique his home country. The biography is positioned to become the new standard for Baldwin studies.</p>

          <p>A writer reflects on the powerful role jewelry plays in shaping identity and reinvention, using her grandmother's watch as a central talisman. The essay explores how accessories, more than clothing, become daily emblems of who we are and who we aspire to be, connecting us to our personal history. The author contemplates her grandmother's life of self-reinvention—from ballet dancer to painter—and how her eclectic jewelry collection was part of that creative expression. By wearing her grandmother's pieces, the author feels a tangible link to her past, contemplating how these inherited objects bridge generations and help her travel toward her own future self.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk surged nearly 5% following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval of its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, for treating a serious liver disease. The drug is now authorized for adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) who have moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This approval marks a significant expansion for Wegovy beyond its primary use for obesity and diabetes, making it the first GLP-1 class drug approved for MASH. The decision was based on a trial where Wegovy showed a statistically significant improvement in liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate a first group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical treatment in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-led operation of its kind during the conflict, coordinated by the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization facilitating their travel through a third country to the UK, where they will be treated by the NHS. The move follows pressure from a cross-party group of MPs who urged the government to act without delay.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is facing a critical test in a by-election for the rural Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot. After losing his own seat in the last general election, Poilievre must win this contest by a significant margin to solidify his leadership ahead of a mandatory party review in January. The race is unusual, featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. Despite the crowded field, Poilievre is widely expected to win the Conservative stronghold, which will return him to the House of Commons and allow him to directly challenge Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
