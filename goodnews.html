          <h2>Taiwan Holds Unprecedented Recall Election Targeting Opposition Lawmakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 01:39:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a large-scale recall election that could remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall effort was initiated by citizens angered by the KMT-led majority bloc's actions, including obstructing the defense budget and passing controversial legislative changes perceived as favoring China. The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. For the recalls to succeed, a turnout of over 25% is required in each district, with more votes in favor of ousting the lawmakers than against it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for a commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. The reactor, named the CFR-1000, is a gigawatt-level facility intended to be more fuel-efficient and is now awaiting final government approval. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like Russia and the United States, which are also pursuing advanced reactor technologies. The project is expected to become operational after 2030, marking a key milestone in the country's strategy to enhance its nuclear power capabilities and energy independence.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in Win Over Red Sox</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 22:15:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense, which has struggled for much of July, demonstrated renewed strength in a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games, providing a much-needed boost. Key contributions came from veteran Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and rookie Andy Pages, who continued his recent surge with multiple hits. This offensive improvement comes at a critical time, just ahead of the MLB trade deadline, and may influence the team's decisions on whether to acquire more hitting talent.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge fund sector is capitalizing on challenges within the U.S. academic system to attract top-tier talent. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are successfully recruiting PhD candidates and engineers who face university funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. By offering competitive salaries, these Chinese firms are building the intellectual capital needed to advance their use of artificial intelligence and expand globally. This brain drain from the U.S. is fueling the rapid growth of China's quant fund market, which is now the second-largest in the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month prison sentence for fraud and identity theft. Santos pleaded guilty to a range of offenses, including fabricating his biography to defraud voters and donors, running a credit card scheme, and misusing campaign funds for personal luxury expenses. His brief but scandalous political career saw him help the GOP secure a House majority in 2022 before his lies unraveled, leading to his expulsion from Congress. After his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to Donald Trump for a future chance at redemption.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her protracted trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, has been fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her trademark renewal since 2022. L'Oréal argues that 'nkd' is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and would create consumer confusion, a claim Dowdeswell says is unsupported by any evidence from her 15 years in business. After significant delays, a hearing with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has been scheduled, with the small business owner stating she is ready to continue the costly fight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's warmest and sunniest spring on record has created a boom for certain insects like ladybirds, wasps, and butterflies, which thrive in the conditions. An abundance of aphids provided a plentiful food source, while the warmth allowed butterflies to complete their life cycles faster, in stark contrast to the previous year's low numbers. However, the associated lack of rain is a cause for concern, as dry wetlands could negatively impact insect and amphibian populations next year. While this summer has seen a visible increase in some species, the long-term trend for the UK's flying insect population remains one of decline.</p>

          <p>An Illinois judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents. The lawsuit, filed in February, had argued that these local ordinances unlawfully thwarted federal immigration enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the city's policies are a legitimate exercise of local authority and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the ruling, stating that the city is safer when its police can focus on local needs rather than being compelled to assist with federal immigration agendas.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society is exploring the impact of the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history that began in the late 1940s. The exhibit focuses on the 'Hollywood Ten,' a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and professionally ostracized for refusing to answer questions about their alleged Communist affiliations before the House Un-American Activities Committee. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals like Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan to testify, and created a climate of fear. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, democracy, and the consequences of punishing unpopular political views.</p>

          <p>A Whittier man has been arrested on federal fraud charges for allegedly conning multiple people he met on dating apps out of more than $2 million. Prosecutors claim Christopher Earl Lloyd used platforms like Tinder and Hinge to find victims, whom he then deceived by fabricating a successful career as a financial manager and promising high returns on investment opportunities. He allegedly collected money through cash, wire transfers, and payment apps, then used the funds for personal expenses, including a down payment on a Lexus. If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in federal prison for the scheme.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is working to rescue the state's bighorn sheep population, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The disease, spread from non-native animals, wiped out about half of the native sheep. In a major conservation effort, biologists captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd and airlifted them over 200 miles to an isolated, safe mountain range. A recent follow-up visit confirmed the success of the mission, as biologists found the relocated herd thriving and growing with the birth of new lambs.</p>
