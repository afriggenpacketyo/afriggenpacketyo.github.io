          <p>Google's cloud infrastructure experienced significant global outages, causing disruptions for numerous internet services, including Shopify and OpenAI. The outages began in the late morning, Pacific Time, affecting multiple Google Cloud Platform (GCP) products across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Services such as Amazon's Twitch, Microsoft's GitHub, and Intuit's Mailchimp also appeared to be impacted. Google's cloud unit, led by Thomas Kurian, has been a growing segment of Google in recent years and is benefiting from demand for artificial intelligence products and services, making the outage a notable setback. By evening, Kurian announced that all services were back up and running and apologized for the disruption.</p>

          <p>China's infrastructure, from subway stations to high-speed rail, is a point of pride and a symbol of its rapid development. The nation has built more dams, bridges, and high-rises than any other country, reflecting its focus on engineering and construction. China's STEM graduates outnumber those of the US by a significant margin, and most of its top officials are engineers. This emphasis on engineering has led to the country being described as an "engineering state," contrasting with the US, which is sometimes referred to as a "lawyerly state."</p>
