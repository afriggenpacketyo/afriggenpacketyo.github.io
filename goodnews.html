          <p>NPR's roving correspondent Frank Langfitt covered both a military parade and a "No Kings" protest against the politicization of the armed forces, offering a unique lens on America's political and cultural divisions. Langfitt notes the events served as a Rorschach test, highlighting stark differences within the nation. By attending both events, he gained a different perspective, similar to how he examines other countries. The article suggests that these events expose underlying tensions and varying viewpoints present in American society, illustrating a nation grappling with its identity and direction. The ability to understand these varying viewpoints is a vital aspect of a healthy republic, even though these different viewpoints may be at odds. Optimism can be found in the fact that there are peaceful demonstrations of differing opinions.</p>

          <p>This article examines the challenges faced by receptionists at a GP practice during the "8am scramble" for appointments, highlighting patient frustrations and verbal abuse. The Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham experiences manic phone lines and increasing demand, leading to receptionists bearing the brunt of patient upset. The practice has implemented upgrades like a call-back option, but high demand means some patients inevitably miss out. A new government contract aims to alleviate the pressure by allowing online appointment booking and triaging patients based on medical need, potentially easing the burden on receptionists and improving patient access to care.</p>

Additionally, the Lib Dems suggest distributing pamphlets to prepare British homes for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks.
