          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully dismantled a series of healthcare fraud schemes aiming to defraud the government of $14.6 billion, marking the largest such initiative in its history. The nationwide operation resulted in criminal charges against 324 individuals, including 93 medical professionals, and the seizure of over $245 million in assets. Some of the complex operations were orchestrated by transnational criminal organizations, which used stolen American identities to submit billions in fraudulent claims to programs like Medicare, highlighting a sophisticated threat to the U.S. healthcare system.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, was sentenced to life in prison for the 1967 sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old widow Louisa Dunne in Bristol, England. The conviction, considered one of the UK's oldest solved cold cases, was secured after investigators re-examined evidence in 2023 and found a DNA match on the victim's skirt. The judge described the attack as "pitiless and cruel" and told Headley he would die in prison, bringing long-awaited justice to the victim's family after 58 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a guide to distinguishing between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke, offering advice on how to respond to each condition. Heat exhaustion is characterized by symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and cool skin, and requires moving to a cool place and rehydrating. Heat stroke is a life-threatening emergency where the body loses its ability to cool down, leading to a rapid temperature rise, and requires immediate medical attention and aggressive cooling measures. The best prevention is to avoid prolonged sun exposure and stay well-hydrated during hot weather.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A previously unknown novel by the acclaimed German writer and journalist Sebastian Haffner has become a bestseller in Germany nearly a century after it was written. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was penned in 1932 as the Weimar Republic was collapsing and captures a sense of impending doom while retaining youthful hope. The manuscript was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only recently published, offering a rare glimpse into Haffner's early literary talent before he fled Nazi Germany and became a renowned historical writer.</p>

          <p>A viral image circulating on social media platform X falsely claims to show the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute. A DW fact-check reveals the satellite image actually depicts an Iranian missile facility in Tabriz that was damaged during Israeli attacks on Iran. By using reverse image search and comparing geographical features on Google Maps, the report confirms the misattribution.

          <h2>Opinion: The Overlooked Value of Protest in Countering the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that one of the most crucial functions of political protest is to break the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Public demonstrations, from climate change rallies to abortion rights marches, serve as a visible signal of collective opinion, correcting misperceptions about what society truly believes. By making dissent public, protests can build common knowledge and prevent unpopular policies or regimes from persisting due to a public that is merely muted, not in agreement.</p>

          <p>A new law in Denmark has taken effect, making women subject to military conscription for the first time. Women turning 18 will now join men in a lottery system that could require them to serve for an 11-month period, an increase from the previous four-month term. This change, which follows the examples of Norway and Sweden, is part of Denmark's effort to boost its defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets amid heightened security concerns in Europe. The government aims to increase its number of annual conscripts to 6,500 by 2033.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has discussed reassigning some of the 4,000 California National Guard troops from their controversial deployment in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The troops were deployed by the Trump administration to handle immigration-related protests over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, who warned the move could hinder wildfire response. With an active fire season expected, the proposal would return 200 Guard members to standby for firefighting duties, addressing concerns about depleted resources.</p>

This marks a major shift, as non-Chinese producers previously struggled to compete with China's lower costs and dominant market share. The supply chain disruption has highlighted global dependency on China for these critical components, essential for electric vehicles and wind turbines, accelerating efforts to build alternative production capabilities in Europe and the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis suggests that Chelsea's recent transfer activity, particularly the signing of forward Jo√£o Pedro, is driven by head coach Enzo Maresca's desire to make his team's attack less predictable. Last season, Chelsea's rigid system often struggled against defensive opponents, making them reliant on speedy wingers. Jo√£o Pedro offers a different profile as a player who can drop deep, link play, and create space for others, providing tactical versatility. The move is part of a broader strategy to build a multifaceted attack capable of adapting to different defensive setups in a demanding season.</p>
