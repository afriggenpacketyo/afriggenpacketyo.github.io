The company projects its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year and reach $144 billion within five years, driven by massive AI deals, including with OpenAI. This staggering growth trajectory left financial analysts "blown away" and "in shock," signaling a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, with the potential to dramatically improve diagnostic accuracy. The test, which measures the p-tau217 protein, is expected to increase the accuracy of early-stage diagnosis from 70% to over 90%. Previously, definitive diagnosis required invasive procedures like lumbar punctures or expensive PET scans. This development could become a standard part of NHS care, enabling earlier treatment and better planning for patients and their families.</p>

          <p>New Mexico has announced it will become the first state in the nation to offer free childcare to all residents, regardless of income. The initiative expands an existing program that provided no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level, which has already been credited with reducing poverty. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham stated the policy will provide financial relief, support the economy, and improve child well-being. The move is being hailed as a potential "model for the nation" in early childhood support.</p>

          <p>The Metro bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year following a successful overhaul that boosted ridership by 24%. Led by a former bus driver, the agency reinvented its routes and improved frequency based on direct feedback from passengers, all without a budget increase. Key changes included running buses seven days a week and every 15 minutes on high-demand routes. The system's success is being highlighted as a model for how public transit can thrive by prioritizing community needs.</p>

          <p>Unitree Robotics, a leading Chinese developer of humanoid robots, is planning an initial public offering that could value the company as high as $7 billion. The Zhejiang-based startup has become a key player in a sector strongly supported by the Chinese government, which aims for mass production of such robots by 2025. An IPO would help Unitree solidify its position against domestic rivals and international competitors like Tesla's Optimus. The company has reportedly been profitable since 2020 and has already deployed robots in factories for automakers like BYD. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed eliminating the £100 limit on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping a card. This would align card payments with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move reflects changing consumer habits, it has raised concerns about fraud, though the FCA states that providers would be responsible for losses and would only permit higher values for low-risk transactions. If approved, the changes could be implemented early next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to analysis from Goldman Sachs, investors are continuing to reward companies that aggressively repurchase their own shares, even as the overall pace of buybacks has slowed. This strategy can provide an edge for investors, as companies with a consistent history of reducing their share count have been outperforming the market. Such "buyback aristocrats" demonstrate management's confidence in their own stock and help support the share price by reducing the available supply, a particularly effective strategy when the economy is slowing.
