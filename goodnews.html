          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency after experiencing mild leg swelling. His physician described the condition as benign and common for his age group, ruling out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis. Chronic venous insufficiency is a circulatory condition where veins struggle to return blood from the legs to the heart, often managed with compression, exercise, and lifestyle adjustments. The announcement followed public speculation after photos showed swelling and bruising on the president's hand.</p>

          <p>The Long Beach City Council is set to evaluate a proposal to bring a new independent minor league baseball team to the city's historic Blair Field. The potential ownership group includes a co-founder of the successful Oakland Ballers, with plans for the team to join the Pioneer League next season. Proponents believe that despite past failures of independent teams in Long Beach, the city's strong baseball tradition and current growth make it a prime location. The plan would require a collaborative agreement with Long Beach State, the field's primary tenant.</p>

          <p>Nine-time NBA All-Star Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he played for 11 seasons. The deal is said to include a player option and a no-trade clause. Lillard, who was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks earlier this month, is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles tendon surgery. Despite interest from other contenders, he chose to rejoin Portland, where his family lives, creating a reunion that aligns with the team's future plans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth compounds to China increased threefold, as China's overall imports of these strategic minerals hit a record high. This trade shift is detailed in a report by the China-Brazil Business Council, which suggests that ongoing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing may be rerouting global supply chains. As the U.S. and China impose trade barriers on each other, emerging economies like Brazil appear to be absorbing some of the impact. The trend is seen as part of China's strategy to diversify its access to critical resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the "Genius Act," landmark bipartisan legislation that creates a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. The bill, which now heads to the president's desk, aims to provide consumer protection and clear rules for the $250 billion digital currency market. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar to reduce volatility. Proponents believe the new regulations will foster innovation in digital payments, while also allowing traditional financial institutions like banks to issue their own stablecoins securely.
