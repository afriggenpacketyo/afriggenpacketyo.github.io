          <p>Lucy Guo, a 30-year-old serial entrepreneur and one of the world's youngest female billionaires, exhibits a unique blend of frugality and luxury in her spending habits. Despite a net worth of $1.3 billion, she actively seeks deals on platforms like Uber Eats and uses Uber X. However, Guo also invests in appreciating assets, including a nearly $30 million mansion in Hollywood Hills and other properties, and splurged on a vintage Ferrari. Her company, Passes, recently faced a class action lawsuit alleging distribution of child sexual abuse material, which Guo and Passes vehemently deny, calling it a "shakedown." This article explores her contrasting financial choices and the legal challenges facing her current venture.</p>

          <p>Clayton Kershaw delivered another masterful performance, pitching five innings of one-run ball to secure his fifth consecutive victory for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The veteran left-hander retired 14 straight batters after an early Reds run, relying on his precise 88-mph fastball, effective slider, and mixed curveball and splitter to keep the opposing lineup off-balance. The Dodgers' offense steadily wore down Cincinnati's pitching, erasing an early deficit and breaking the game open with a four-run sixth inning, highlighted by a home run from Will Smith and a two-run double from Miguel Rojas. This 6-3 win maintains the Dodgers' first-place standing in the National League West, showcasing Kershaw's impressive season and the team's strong push towards the playoffs.</p>

          <p>A time capsule buried by Diana, Princess of Wales, at Great Ormond Street Hospital in 1991 has been opened, revealing a collection of items representing life in the 1990s. The lead-encased wooden box contained a Kylie Minogue CD, a solar-powered calculator, a passport, a pocket TV, and a photograph of Princess Diana herself. The items, chosen by children through a Blue Peter competition, were intended to be unearthed centuries later but were retrieved early for the construction of a new children's cancer center. This discovery offers a nostalgic glimpse into the era and Princess Diana's engagement with the hospital, where she served as president.</p>

          <h2>US Business Travel Remains Strong Despite Decline in Leisure Bookings</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from SAP Concur indicates a decline in leisure travel to the United States this year, contrasting with stable and robust business travel to the country. The US emerged as the top global destination for business travelers in the first half of 2025, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings, significantly outpacing Germany and the UK. Business travel between Canada and the US also held steady, with the US being the destination for nearly 80% of outbound Canadian business trips. This trend suggests that corporate interests continue to drive travel to the US, even as overall global business travel growth has slowed and leisure travel faces headwinds, potentially influenced by tariff policies.

Raw materials producers, steelmakers, and petroleum refiners also transitioned from losses to profits. Statistician Yu Weining noted that policy measures promoting a "reasonable rebound in prices" contributed to this recovery. Despite this improvement, profit margins remain under pressure due to softened domestic demand and persistent deflationary pressures, which continue to affect corporate bottom lines.

          <p>Canada Goose, the luxury parka maker, has received take-private bids valuing it at approximately $1.35 billion, as its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, explores an exit. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International, along with other interested buyers like Bosideng International and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product, have made offers. Bain Capital, which has controlled Canada Goose for 12 years, is looking to offload its stake. The move to privatize is seen as a way to give buyers greater autonomy to turn around the company, which has struggled with growth momentum and faced questions regarding its brand positioning and marketing strategy amid cautious consumer spending.

          <p>China's Tiangong space station has achieved significant progress in ultra-high-temperature material research, surpassing similar experiments conducted on the International Space Station (ISS). Scientists on Tiangong successfully used electrostatic levitation in a container-free laboratory to suspend and heat tiny metal samples to approximately 3,000 degrees. This technique, which avoids contamination from physical containers, is crucial for studying heat-resistant materials vital for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles. The findings will aid in designing advanced tungsten alloys and bolster fundamental research for nuclear and aerospace applications, demonstrating the reliability of Tiangong's four-year-old laboratory cabinet and China's growing prowess in space science.</p>

          <p>Anaheim is actively seeking to determine the long-term viability of Angel Stadium, known as the Big A, as its 60th anniversary approaches and the Angels' lease extends through 2032. City Manager Jim Vanderpool confirmed that there are currently no discussions between the city and the team regarding plans beyond the current lease. This follows the 2022 cancellation of a deal for Angels owner Arte Moreno to purchase the stadium and surrounding land, prompted by a federal corruption investigation. An assessment of the facility's condition, expected to be finalized by mid-2026, will inform future decisions on whether to renovate or replace the aging ballpark.</p>

          <p>The 2026 midterm elections are shaping up with several key Senate contests that will determine control of the chamber. Democrats face the challenge of defending 13 seats while Republicans aim to hold 24, with few clear opportunities for Democrats to flip seats in Trump-won states. The retirement of three Democratic senators has created potential openings for the GOP. High-profile races are taking shape in North Carolina, where former Governor Roy Cooper faces RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, and Georgia, where vulnerable Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff is targeted. Other competitive states include New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ohio, alongside intra-party battles in Texas, indicating a complex and potentially expensive election cycle.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated retail crime ring, responsible for over 600 thefts totaling an estimated $10 million in merchandise from Home Depot stores across Southern California, has been dismantled. Authorities arrested 14 individuals in "Operation Kill Switch," charging nine key players, including alleged ringleader David Ahl, who faces 45 felony counts. Ahl is accused of directing theft crews to steal high-value electrical items, which he then resold through his electronics storefront. The operation, which also involved Ahl's brother-in-law and ex-wife, highlights the scale of organized retail crime. Law enforcement seized millions in stolen property and illicit money, praising new legislation that allows consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, marking a critical achievement after a series of previous failures. The 40-story tall rocket performed remarkably, with the Super Heavy first stage boosting Starship into the upper atmosphere before returning for a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators and reignited an engine in space, then executed a controlled re-entry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean despite some heat shield damage. This success is vital for SpaceX's ambitions for lunar and Martian missions, as well as NASA's Artemis program, providing much-needed confidence in the vehicle's development.</p>
