          <p>The Camogie Association is facing increasing pressure to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts, with a Special Congress scheduled to vote on the issue. Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues that enforcing skort wearing is sexist and impacts player comfort. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% desire the option to wear shorts. Some players have threatened to boycott games if forced to wear skorts, highlighting the intensity of the debate within the sport.</p>

          <p>Chris Mason of the BBC analyzes the recent trade deal between the UK and the US, noting that while it is a positive development, it is limited in scope. The deal primarily mitigates recent tariff increases rather than establishing a broad free trade agreement. While the deal provides some relief for British businesses, some critics argue that it falls short of pre-existing trade conditions. Mason concludes that Prime Minister Starmer can claim a limited win, but ongoing scrutiny of the deal's specifics is necessary.</p>
