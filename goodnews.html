          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams reportedly used at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation, a detail revealed in newly released documents. Adams explained that he used multiple phones for different purposes, including office, personal, and campaign use, noting that many New Yorkers have several phones. The F.B.I. tracked Adams's location using cellphone data and even sought permission to use a ‚Äúcell site simulator‚Äù to identify other devices he might be using. Adams bristled at the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his primary phone's password to dyslexia and suggesting the timing of device seizures was intended to humiliate him.</p>

This reversal comes ahead of a congressional hearing with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., where he was expected to face questions about the layoffs. The reinstatements mean that programs such as the approval of N95 respirators and protective gear for firefighters can resume, though many workers at NIOSH and other CDC departments remain laid off.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods may reduce the incentive for Chinese auto-parts makers to establish production facilities in the U.S. Following trade talks, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on most Chinese imports from 145% to 30% for 90 days, providing some relief to mainland-based producers. Despite the reduced tariffs, uncertainty remains, as businesses are wary of potential future tariff increases. Chinese-made EV batteries now face a 58.4% US tariff, a decrease from the previous 173.4%.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from representatives from various nations. This plan aims to offer a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could be seen as a significant achievement by President Trump.</p>

The decision, made during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, aims to provide an economic lifeline to Syria, which has been devastated by years of civil war.

          <p>New York Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger delivered a talk emphasizing the critical role of a free and independent press in a healthy democracy, which is under direct attack through efforts to curtail and punish independent journalism. He outlined three essential roles of the press: ensuring trustworthy news and information, fostering mutual understanding, and holding powerful interests accountable. Sulzberger highlighted that the anti-press playbook, including sowing distrust, exploiting civil courts, abusing legal authority, amplifying attacks, and replacing independent media with government-friendly outlets, is being used in the U.S. The author concludes that democracy requires the press to arm everyone with the information and context they need to understand and meet the moment.</p>
