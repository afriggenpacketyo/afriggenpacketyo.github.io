          <p>Frances Lee, a professor at Princeton, discusses her book, *In Covid's Wake: How Our Politics Failed Us*, which analyzes the political system's response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The article highlights the departure from pre-existing pandemic plans, the lack of a scientific basis for some measures, and the challenges of cost-benefit analysis in policymaking. Lee argues that health officials were often intolerant of criticism and that there was a disjunction between what officials said in private and in public, such as the claim that vaccines would prevent transmission. She emphasizes the importance of acknowledging uncertainty and resisting moralized antagonism in policymaking, as well as confronting the limits of our knowledge.</p>

          <p>Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, stated that Japan will not agree to a trade deal with the U.S. unless all new tariffs are reviewed, including those on automobiles and auto parts. This comes after the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on auto parts, prompting disappointment from Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japan insists on negotiating with the U.S. on all tariffs, including those on steel and aluminum, emphasizing the protection of its national interests in the tariff talks. The U.S. has also announced reciprocal tariffs, but the extra portion for Japan is currently on hold.</p>

          <p>Early vote counting in Australia's general election indicates the ruling center-left Labor Party is likely to secure a second term. The Australian Electoral Commission's projections show Labor with a significant lead in the House of Representatives, although some contests remain volatile. Key issues in the campaign have been energy policy and the cost of living crisis, with the opposition blaming government waste for inflation. The Labor Party has criticized the opposition for mimicking U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, while also highlighting improved relations with China under their leadership.</p>

          <p>Kim Moon Soo has secured the nomination from the People Power Party (PPP) as their candidate for the upcoming presidential election in South Korea.

          <h2>MP Calls for Reconsideration of Alcohol Ban in Football Stands</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:09:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A York MP is advocating for a modern approach to the ban on alcohol consumption in football stands, citing legislation from 1985 aimed at curbing hooliganism. Luke Charters argues that the ban creates an inconsistency compared to other sports where fans can drink freely. He suggests trialing the consumption of alcohol in view of the pitch, similar to a trial in the women's game, initially in the lower leagues, while maintaining family zones where it would be inappropriate. The Football Supporters Association supports the MP's comments and would welcome trials in the men's game.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 06:03:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that captive-bred axolotls can thrive in their native Mexico City wetlands, offering hope for the critically endangered species. A study tracked 18 axolotls released into both artificial and restored wetlands, discovering that they gained weight and successfully avoided predators. This suggests that reintroduction efforts can be successful if water conditions are ideal, and that axolotls can adapt to man-made habitats. The exotic aquatic critters are also a favorite among medical researchers, who hope that the amphibians' extreme regenerative abilities could eventually help doctors better treat catastrophic injuries in people.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article argues that universities deserve special standing within First Amendment jurisprudence, similar to the press, due to their vital role in the search for truth and knowledge. The author discusses the historical context of academic freedom and the importance of universities as institutions that discover, preserve, and pass on knowledge. He criticizes the Trump administration's attempts to control universities and emphasizes the need for universities to protect their independence and resist government intrusion. The author says that universities at their best will at times serve, like the press, as the public‚Äôs check on government, but they will also serve as a check on the public itself.</p>
