          <p>England's cricket team achieved a record-breaking 342-run victory over South Africa in the third one-day international match. Young batsman Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century, an elegant 110 runs, supported by Joe Root who also made a hundred, propelling England to a total of 414-5. Bowler Jofra Archer then dismantled the South African batting lineup with a hostile spell, taking four wickets for just 18 runs. The dominant performance provided a significant morale boost for England, despite South Africa having already secured the series win.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy won his second Irish Open title in a thrilling conclusion at the K Club, defeating Sweden's Joakim Lagergren in a playoff. McIlroy forced the extra holes by sinking a dramatic 25-foot eagle putt on the final hole of regulation play, tying Lagergren's score. After both players birdied the first two playoff holes, McIlroy secured the victory on the third when Lagergren's shot found the water. The win marks McIlroy's fourth victory of the year and his first since his Masters triumph in April, providing a memorable homecoming for the world number two.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 13:20:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot recently soared to nearly $1.8 billion, a new analysis reveals significant state-by-state differences in lottery spending. Massachusetts residents lead the nation, spending an average of $915 per person annually on lottery tickets, followed by Rhode Island at $573. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 a year, which may be related to fewer purchasing opportunities in rural areas. For many states, lottery sales represent a notable source of public revenue, accounting for an average of 1% of their general funds and reaching as high as 3% in some cases.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore, who has been widely viewed as a potential leading Democratic candidate for the 2028 presidential election, has officially stated he will not run. During a television appearance, Moore confirmed his intention to seek re-election as governor in 2026 and serve a full second term. Despite his consistent denials of presidential ambitions, speculation had grown due to his rising national profile, particularly his leadership following the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Moore has recently been a vocal critic of President Trump's policies targeting Baltimore, further elevating his presence in national politics.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot and social media influencer, has been released after being held for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica. He was detained for allegedly landing his plane in Chilean territory without permission after filing a false flight plan. The charges were dropped, but Guo was ordered to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from Chile for three years. Guo had been attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a controversial team order from McLaren. The team instructed Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place after a slow pit stop had reversed their positions on the track. Norris had been running ahead of Piastri for most of the race before a faulty wheel gun delayed his stop. While Piastri expressed disagreement with the call, he complied, a decision that will likely fuel debate as the two drivers battle for the championship.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Black Ferns delivered a powerful statement at the Women's Rugby World Cup, defeating Ireland 40-0 to secure the top spot in Pool C. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a ruthless display by the reigning champions. The victory not only ensures New Zealand a theoretically easier quarter-final match but also serves as revenge for a defeat to Ireland in the WXV1 tournament last year. Despite the loss, Ireland had already qualified for the quarter-finals and will advance to the knockout stage.</p>

The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening events such as severe weather or public safety emergencies.

The distinctive red car, which resembles a Ferrari, was tracked to a property after a new video of it on the D4 motorway surfaced. The driver, still in his racing suit and helmet, was taken into custody for questioning. Because the driver's face was always obscured by a helmet in previous sightings, police had been unable to press charges, but he now faces fines and a possible license suspension.</p>

This sustained investment has reportedly added over $1.3 trillion to Bitcoin's market capitalization, with corporate-held reserves growing from 510,000 to 1.3 million BTC since January 2024. The trend, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, has expanded across various industries, with businesses now controlling over 6% of Bitcoin's circulating supply. Analysts suggest this institutional inflow could be a key driver for the cryptocurrency's future price movements. (not investment advice)</p>

The more critical factor for the economy is overall consumer health, including income and wealth, which currently remain strong enough to absorb moderate price increases.

The research, which looked at data spanning from the 1930s to the 1990s, examined nine disorders including depression, anxiety, and ADHD. The phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," held true across different cultures and generations, suggesting that people with similar psychiatric conditions tend to form partnerships. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding, similar environments, or the limiting effects of social stigma.</p>
