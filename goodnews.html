          <p>A federal judge in Chicago has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Justice Department against the city's sanctuary policies. The lawsuit alleged that Chicago's ordinances, which limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, unlawfully interfere with federal enforcement. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins, a Biden appointee, ruled that the policies are lawful and do not violate the Constitution's Supremacy Clause, affirming states' rights under the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor praised the decision as a victory for public safety and the city's welcoming stance.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams humorously remarked she returned to competition for the health insurance benefits, highlighting a challenge many Americans face. The article explains how the U.S. system ties insurance to employment, making breaks from work, like Williams took, financially precarious due to high COBRA costs. It notes her personal health needs, including Sjogren's syndrome, and explains how the Affordable Care Act has improved options for those with pre-existing conditions. The piece uses her situation to illustrate the broader complexities and "job lock" associated with the American healthcare model.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort. The former U.S. president was seen playing golf and is scheduled to meet with UK and Scottish leaders during his stay. The visit has prompted protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh and raised concerns about the cost and impact of the security measures, which include road closures and a heavy police presence. Trump commented on European immigration and wind farms upon his arrival, setting a political tone for the visit.</p>

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to remove two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to gain a majority in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, which has resisted President Lai Ching-te's agenda. The recall was initiated by citizens angry over the opposition's legislative actions, which they view as favoring China and undermining Taiwan's democracy.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old man, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a terminal lung disease, during a routine pre-surgery X-ray. With less than a year to live, he was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant, a procedure his brother had not survived. After a difficult wait in the hospital, Kennedy successfully received the transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. Now recovering with nearly full lung capacity, he is training a new therapy dog named "Encore" to celebrate his second chance at life.</p>

          <p>At the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, prominent AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, have called for increased collaboration between the United States and China on AI safety. Hinton, often called a "godfather of AI," warned that while national interests may diverge on some issues, all countries share a common interest in preventing AI from growing beyond human control. He likened the potential danger to a "cute tiger cub" that could mature into a threat, emphasizing that international cooperation is essential to manage the risks, similar to Cold War-era nuclear non-proliferation talks.</p>
