        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political event in Taiwan, all lawmakers targeted in a large-scale recall vote, primarily from the opposition Kuomintang party, have retained their seats. The "Great Recall" was initiated by a civic movement concerned that the legislators were excessively influenced by Beijing, threatening Taiwan's democracy. The failure of the recall effort means the opposition will maintain its majority in the legislature, potentially intensifying the political deadlock with President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The outcome was closely watched as it could have shifted the balance of power in the politically polarized nation.</p>

          <p>At a major conference in Shanghai, leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, urged for collaboration between the United States and China to manage the potential existential risks posed by advanced artificial intelligence. Hinton emphasized that despite divergent national interests on many issues, preventing AI from "taking over" is a critical common ground for all nations. He compared the current situation to the US-Soviet cooperation on nuclear non-proliferation during the Cold War, stressing the urgent need for international cooperation. The call comes amidst a heated technological race between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary with events at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps. Founded in 1775 by the Second Continental Congress with Benjamin Franklin as its first postmaster general, the agency has been a crucial part of the nation's infrastructure. The celebration occurs as the Trump administration reportedly considers major changes, including privatization, a move the new Postmaster General, David Steiner, has stated he opposes. The anniversary highlights the Postal Service's long history and its current precarious political situation.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that using credit cards to pay for a wedding can be a smart strategy, but only if handled with care. Recent surveys show a significant number of couples are using credit to cover rising wedding costs, which are expected to average $36,000 in 2025. The primary benefit comes from earning rewards like points or miles by charging expenses and then immediately paying off the balance with savings. However, experts warn against carrying this debt, as high interest rates can create significant financial stress for a new marriage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A proposed federal bill, the Captive Primate Safety Act, aims to outlaw the private ownership and breeding of primates across the United States, addressing a trade fueled by social media and entertainment. Animal welfare experts highlight the severe suffering these animals endure, from being poached as infants to living with chronic stress and malnutrition in unsuitable human environments. The Oakland Zoo, which rescues trafficked primates, illustrates the physical and psychological damage they suffer. The bill, currently in a House committee, is seen as a key step in protecting primates worldwide from a brutal industry.</p>

The initiative emphasizes China's "AI plus" plan to integrate the technology across industries and offer assistance to other nations, particularly in the Global South.

          <p>This opinion piece pays tribute to the late actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, reflecting on the profound significance of his role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." The author explains how Theo, along with other key Black characters from that era, provided crucial representation for young Black viewers, navigating struggles with identity, academics, and coming of age. The column argues that Warner's graceful portrayal helped redefine Blackness on television, challenging narrow stereotypes at a time when positive, successful Black families were absent from the screen. His death is felt not just as nostalgia but as gratitude for the burden he carried.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to nutrition experts, bison is a healthier alternative to beef for burgers and other dishes due to its superior nutritional profile. Registered dietitians note that bison has fewer calories, less total and saturated fat, and lower cholesterol compared to beef, while offering similar or higher levels of key nutrients like iron and vitamin B12. While beef can be a good choice for those needing more calories, such as athletes, bison's leanness makes it particularly beneficial for individuals concerned with cardiovascular health or insulin resistance. Bison is described as having a slightly sweeter, cleaner taste than beef.</p>
