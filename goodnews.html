          <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama have jointly addressed persistent divorce rumors, dismissing them with humor on a recent podcast episode. The speculation arose after Barack Obama attended several high-profile events alone earlier in the year. Michelle Obama explained her absence by stating she now feels free to make her own decisions, as her children are grown and her husband is out of office. She reaffirmed the strength of their marriage, emphasizing that despite challenges, she has never considered leaving her husband.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton has voiced strong opposition to the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system, which made its MLB All-Star Game debut. The "robot umpire" technology allows teams to challenge ball and strike calls, with a notable instance occurring in the first inning when a call was overturned. Buxton expressed his disapproval to Fox News Digital, stating that the system complicates the game and detracts from its traditional elements. He believes the human element is a core part of baseball's integrity and appeal.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced via social media that he convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its products sold in the United States. This move aligns with the advocacy of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has campaigned against ingredients like corn syrup. While Coca-Cola products in many other countries, such as Mexico and the UK, already use cane sugar, the company has not yet officially commented on Trump's claim. The change would represent a significant shift in the formulation of one of America's most iconic beverages.</p>

          <p>The UK and Germany are set to sign a new bilateral agreement covering migration, defense, and business, with a key provision aimed at disrupting human smuggling operations. As part of the deal, Germany will tighten its laws to make it illegal to facilitate illegal migration to the UK, a move intended to help dismantle supply chains for small boats used in Channel crossings. The commitment, expected to be legislated by the end of the year, comes as the UK government faces pressure over a significant increase in small boat arrivals. The deal is part of a broader UK strategy to work with European partners on migration.</p>

This discovery provides a direct look at a process that mirrors the dawn of our own solar system.

          <p>A groundbreaking study has demonstrated that using DNA from three people can successfully prevent children from being born with devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. The technique, known as mitochondrial donation, involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. Researchers in the UK have used this method to help families have eight healthy children, a milestone hailed as a major scientific advance. However, the procedure remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about long-term safety and the ethics of creating "designer babies."</p>
