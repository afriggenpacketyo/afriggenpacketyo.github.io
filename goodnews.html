          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy reassured investors that the company could emerge stronger from the current tariff environment, citing Amazon's broad selection, low pricing, and speedy delivery as key factors. Jassy drew parallels to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which Amazon gained market share despite economic uncertainty. CFO Brian Olsavsky acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs, leading to a wider operating profit guidance range. Jassy mentioned that some sellers might not pass higher costs onto customers, leveraging Amazon's diverse seller base to maintain competitive pricing. Optimism score: 75</p>

CFO Amrita Ahuja highlighted that Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, reflecting continued discipline and efficiency across the business. Despite increasing competition, Square gained market share in its target verticals, and Cash App continued its push into banking services, expanding credit access through Afterpay integration and regulatory approval for Borrow.

          <p>Apple reported better-than-expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter, but shares fell due to light Services division revenue and concerns over tariff costs.

Cook noted that predicting tariff impacts beyond June is difficult due to uncertainty about future trade policies.

Experts say that new vaccines already go through placebo-controlled trials, but that newer versions of the shots may not go through the same process because it is considered unethical to withhold a shot known to be safe from a particular group. Public health experts say the statement is misleading, as childhood vaccinations, including ones for Hepatitis A and B, rotavirus, polio and the mumps, were all initially tested against a placebo. This decision comes as Kennedy has spread false claims about vaccine safety. Optimism score: 35</p>

          <p>Despite Governor Newsom's objections, California Democratic state lawmakers approved changes to a bill that removed tougher penalties for soliciting 16- or 17-year-olds for sexual activity. The controversial action came after a heated debate, with Republicans accusing Democrats of being soft on sex offenders. Democrats pointed to concerns that enhanced punishments could be used to target children in LGBT or interracial relationships. Speaker Robert Rivas circulated a statement throwing his “full support” behind the amendments. Optimism score: 50</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a measure that would dramatically weaken their oversight over religious schools, potentially benefiting the Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal has raised concerns among education experts, including the state education commissioner, who called such changes a “travesty” for children attending religious schools that lack a basic secular education. The potential deal is the result of years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives. A 2022 New York Times investigation found that scores of all-boys yeshivas collected about $1 billion in government funding over a four-year period but failed to provide a basic education.
