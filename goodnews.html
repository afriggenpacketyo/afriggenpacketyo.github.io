          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was brutally murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, leaving behind a crucial clue: bloody, bare footprints. The investigation, detailed in a '48 Hours' episode, spanned decades and involved comparing the footprints to multiple suspects, including Arthur Gray, who was eventually cleared due to a solid alibi. Years later, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that led investigators to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Westrom was convicted of the murder after his DNA and footprints matched those found at the crime scene, bringing closure to a case that had remained unsolved for over 25 years.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, offering long-term operating rights to Chinese companies in exchange for construction financing. This model marks a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative, addressing African governments' debt concerns. The shift is evident in projects like Nairobi‚Äôs mega-highway, the stalled railway, and Zambia‚Äôs Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. For example, during Kenyan President William Ruto‚Äôs visit to China, he sought funding to extend the country‚Äôs Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) to Malaba, with Chinese companies contributing 40% of the cost and gaining exclusive rights to operate the railway for at least 25 years.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election after the previous vote in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization. The annulled election saw Calin Georgescu, a far-right, pro-Russian political outsider, surprisingly win the first round. Alleged electoral violations included the activation of thousands of previously inactive social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging, which was described as a "aggressive Russian hybrid attack," although Moscow denies involvement. Georgescu has been banned from standing in the rerun.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day to night and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous driving conditions. The storm, driven by winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to near-zero in some areas, including Chicago, where visibility dropped to a quarter-mile at Midway International Airport. The dry soil conditions across central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, which was the first time the Weather Service had issued a dust storm warning for Chicago. While dust storms are more common in the Southwest and Great Plains, the event served as a reminder of the impact of dry soil and strong winds on weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a Georgia woman who went missing for weeks in California's Sierra Nevada mountains, recounted her survival story after being found in a snowy cabin. Slaton said she was trapped by an avalanche and immobilized by a steep fall, surviving on wild leeks and snowmelt. Despite attempts to call 911, she relied on her GPS to navigate towards the nearest Starbucks, eventually finding refuge in a cabin. The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort discovered her, and she celebrated her 28th birthday the following day.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide were repatriated on Saturday, facilitated by the U.N. refugee agency. The return follows the seizure of key parts of the region by Rwandan-backed rebels. The majority of the refugees were women and children, and the goal is to repatriate 2,000 people. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration. This repatriation is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Kateryna, Ukraine's only female combat pilot, flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, but faces sexism in the military despite efforts to increase female participation. While the Ukrainian military is working to recruit more women and promote gender equality, stereotypes and marginalization persist. Lieutenant Kateryna, inspired by her father and a female instructor, encourages other women to pursue aviation careers, but acknowledges the challenges of being a woman in a male-dominated profession. The article highlights the ongoing struggle for gender equality within the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Union leaders are scheduled to meet in London to discuss a new defense and security pact, potentially marking a new era of cooperation after Brexit. This renewed partnership is driven by a need for greater collaboration in the face of global uncertainties, including the United States' changing role in international affairs under President Trump. The meeting aims to strengthen military security in Europe and address trade barriers, though disagreements over fishing rights and youth mobility schemes remain obstacles.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fibre-optic gyroscope that offers stable navigation across a wide temperature range for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope, developed by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, provides a more reliable method for measuring orientation and rotation. Fibre-optic gyroscopes, known for their simple structure and high resolution, are used in both military and civilian applications, offering immunity to interference, which is vital for security purposes.</p>
