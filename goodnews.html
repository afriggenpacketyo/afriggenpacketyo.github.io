          <h2>Wimbledon Match Disrupted by Electronic Line-Calling System Failure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a failure in the new electronic line-calling system. The system failed to call a clear "out" ball, leading the chair umpire to order a replay of the point, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova who felt a game was "stolen" from her. The All England Club attributed the incident to operator error and stated the umpire followed established procedure. This event has intensified scrutiny of the technology, which has faced criticism from several players for its perceived inaccuracy during the tournament.</p>

          <p>After winning his third-round match at Wimbledon, American tennis player Ben Shelton used his on-court interview to make a public appeal to Morgan Stanley. He asked the investment bank to grant his sister, Emma, a few extra days off from her job so she could continue to be his "lucky charm" at the tournament. The heartwarming plea was successful, as Shelton later confirmed on social media that his sister's request for more time off was approved. Shelton has advanced to the fourth round without dropping a set.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow discusses his latest book on Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, in a feature that revisits the author's life and legacy.

Chernow highlights the contemporary relevance of themes in Twain's writing, such as politics, class, and race, and his role in defining the American identity. Despite his fame, Twain's life was marked by both idyllic periods and significant personal and financial turmoil, which fueled his enduring critiques of society.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" reflect on the making of the iconic film that created the summer blockbuster genre. The article features interviews with star Richard Dreyfuss, screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, and actress Lorraine Gary, who recount the notoriously difficult production on Martha's Vineyard. Despite a ballooning budget and a frequently malfunctioning mechanical shark, the then 27-year-old director Steven Spielberg turned the challenges into a suspense classic. The film's success fundamentally changed Hollywood and cemented its place as one of the most influential American movies ever made.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal, the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, made landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, early Sunday morning. The storm brought maximum sustained winds of around 50 mph, though it began to weaken as it moved inland. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for parts of the North and South Carolina coasts, with forecasts of heavy rain and potential flash flooding. Chantal is expected to weaken to a tropical depression later in the day and dissipate by Monday, but flood watches remain active for the region.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have discovered a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico, believed to have been a crucial trading hub in the nation's northern Barranca province. The city, founded between 1,800 and 1,500 BC, likely connected early Pacific coast communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon. Researchers believe the discovery provides insight into the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, after it was impacted by climate change. The site contains 18 structures, including ceremonial temples, along with artifacts like clay sculptures and beaded necklaces.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, not as a symbol of immigration. The article traces its transformation, noting that its connection to immigration was largely forged by poet Emma Lazarus's sonnet "The New Colossus." This new meaning was solidified with the opening of Ellis Island and later championed by President John F. Kennedy, who popularized the phrase "a nation of immigrants." The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, signed at the statue's base, further cemented its role as a beacon for those seeking a new life in America.</p>

While potential Chinese investors are concerned about the geopolitical climate, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly receptive and even explicitly seeking such investments.

          <p>A communication expert and author outlines five common phrases that, despite good intentions, can make a person sound judgmental and erode trust in relationships. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can imply the other person is incompetent or wrong, putting them on the defensive. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" or using "yes, and..." to build on ideas. The key is to be mindful of both the intention and the impact of one's words to foster more positive and respectful communication.</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political and cultural influence in the Western Balkans, using "soft power" tactics such as funding the construction of large mosques. The recently inaugurated Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania, funded by Turkey's religious authority, is a prime example of this strategy. Analysts note that this religious and cultural outreach is part of a broader geopolitical and economic agenda, which includes Turkish investment in infrastructure like railroads and hotels across the region. This "infrastructure imperialism" is meant to position Turkey as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, promoting its vision for the future.</p>

          <p>A recent online debate highlights a central question about Bitcoin's future: its utility, given that only about 5% of the population owns it. One camp argues that for Bitcoin to be a true "peer-to-peer electronic cash" as intended, it needs widespread adoption for transactions. The other camp contends that Bitcoin has evolved into "digital gold," a store of value where scarcity and limited ownership are features, not bugs. This article explores the identity crisis, comparing Bitcoin to assets like gold and concluding that its value proposition has shifted from a currency to a speculative, scarce asset.

          <p>Contrary to the hyperbolic rhetoric from both President Trump and his critics, the U.S. economy five months into his second term has remained remarkably stable and "okay." Key indicators like unemployment and inflation have not changed dramatically, and GDP growth continues at a modest pace. The article argues that Trump's policies, including moderated tariffs, have not caused the predicted catastrophe, nor have they ushered in a promised "golden age." While the economy is likely to be worse in the long term, for now it is simply muddling through, a reality that may not satisfy voters who expected a major economic shift. (not investment advice)</p>
