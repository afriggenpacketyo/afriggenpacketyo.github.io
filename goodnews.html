          <p>Sovereignty secured victory at the 157th Belmont Stakes, held in Saratoga Springs, New York, marking the horse's first-place finish in the third leg of the Triple Crown. The race, conducted in muddy conditions, saw Sovereignty defeating a field of seven challengers, with Journalism finishing in second place. This win marks Sovereignty as the first horse to win the Derby, skip the Preakness Stakes, and then win the Belmont. The Belmont took place at Saratoga Race Course due to renovations at Belmont Park, resulting in a shorter race distance of 1 1/4 miles. The victory of Sovereignty is a positive event, and therefore, the optimism score is high. </p>

          <h2>Airline Baggage Rule Confusion Sparks EU Legal Debate</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inconsistent and confusing baggage rules among budget airlines have prompted the EU to consider standardizing carry-on sizes to avoid passenger frustration and unexpected fees. A passenger's humiliating experience with oversized baggage led to a push for fairer rules, resulting in proposed EU legislation for standardized sizing of free underseat baggage. Consumer groups argue the proposals don't go far enough and legitimize charging for reasonably sized hand luggage. Airlines maintain their policies comply with the law and keep fares low, but customers desire universal standards to avoid surprises at the airport. The potential for improved regulations results in a moderate optimism score. </p>

          <p>UK doctors are experimenting with "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, as a novel approach to combat dangerous superbug infections. Early data suggests that these pills can effectively replace antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut with a healthier mix. The stool samples undergo rigorous testing to ensure they are free of harmful bugs before being freeze-dried into a powder and encapsulated. The study showed promising signals that donor bacteria could compete with superbugs, potentially eliminating them or reducing their levels to a manageable state. The article's scientific progress inspires a moderate optimism score. </p>
