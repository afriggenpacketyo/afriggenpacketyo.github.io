          <h2>Palisades High Graduation Relocated to Hollywood Bowl After Fire</h2>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School's graduation ceremony was held at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their high school campus earlier in the year. The event was described as bittersweet, as students honored the opportunity to graduate at the Bowl, a storied venue, but lamented not being able to use their traditional Stadium by the Sea. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the graduates, acknowledging the adversity they faced and encouraging them to find growth and joy amidst the challenges. The ceremony was made possible by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which gifted the venue to the school, and included traditional elements like student performances and speeches. This event is relatively optimistic due to the students overcoming adversity.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Study Reveals How Birds Overtook Dinosaurs in Flight</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The study, which examined feathers dating back 99 million years, revealed how feathers evolved during the Cretaceous period. An essential feature of bird evolution was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs did not have the same ability to fly. The implications of this study are relatively optimistic.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Early Gut Bacteria May Protect Infants from Lung Infections</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body may protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that the presence of Bifidobacterium longum in infants halved their risk of hospitalization due to lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, tracking their health for two years. The protective bacteria were found only in babies born via vaginal delivery, not caesarean section, though researchers do not recommend vaginal seeding. The results of this study are relatively optimistic.</p>

          <h2>Court Delays Oil Restart Near Santa Barbara After Environmental Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 20:42:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The order halts efforts to reactivate the Santa Ynez Unit's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. Sable is now targeting August 1, 2025, for first sales due to the delay, though officials claim the ruling will not impede preparations for restarting oil flow. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, arguing the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. The impact of this ruling is relatively optimistic from an environmental standpoint.</p>

          <h2>Pregnant Women Advised to Avoid Weight-Loss Injections</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Women using weight-loss injections are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding due to concerns about potential harm to unborn babies. Drug safety experts in the UK emphasize that the effects of medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro on unborn babies are unknown. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice. The implications of this article are relatively optimistic.</p>
