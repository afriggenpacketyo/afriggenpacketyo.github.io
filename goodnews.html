          <p>The inaugural summit between leaders of ASEAN, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and China in Kuala Lumpur emphasized deeper cooperation in trade, supply chains, infrastructure, and finance. The partnership aims to address climate change and food security through green energy, digital transformation, connectivity, and sustainable agriculture. This trilateral alliance leverages ASEAN's consumer markets, the GCC's energy resources, and China's manufacturing capabilities. It presents an opportunity to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on the US market by focusing on regional production and enhanced connectivity.</p>

          <p>Pupils at Dame Tipping Primary School in east London have been instructed to stay indoors after a buzzard nested in the playground, raising concerns about potential attacks. The bird, nicknamed Brenda, has reportedly swooped on residents in the village, leading Havering Council to provide advice on deterrents. As buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited, and the school is educating children about the bird. A bird of prey expert visited the school with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle to teach the children about buzzard behavior.</p>

          <p>South Koreans are voting in a snap election to choose a new president after the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol. Pre-election surveys suggest Lee Jae-myung, Yoon's liberal rival, is likely to win due to public frustration. The new president will immediately be sworn in and face challenges such as a slowing economy, U.S. tariffs, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Both candidates have outlined differing approaches to economic policy and international relations.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to reports. After an incident involving Max Verstappen and George Russell, Red Bull ordered Verstappen to give back his position, a decision principal Christian Horner later admitted was a mistake after stewards decided no further action was needed. The second misstep was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision Verstappen immediately questioned. Horner acknowledged that they should have left him out on his soft tires, highlighting the challenges of making strategic calls during races.</p>
