        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and a dozen other cities and counties. This change will affect over 800,000 workers, with analysis suggesting it will disproportionately benefit women, Black, and Hispanic employees. The increases, driven by ballot measures and inflation adjustments, contrast with the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. The average annual wage increase for full-time workers will range from $420 in Oregon to $925 in Alaska.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax on large technology companies, a move made just hours before the first payments were due. This decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump halted trade negotiations, calling the tax a "blatant attack" and threatening new tariffs. The 3% tax would have affected revenues of major U.S. tech firms like Google and Meta, and was projected to generate over C$2 billion in its first year. The reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks between the two nations, with a new agreement targeted by late July.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) currently offer lower interest rates than products like credit cards, making them attractive borrowing options for homeowners. Experts note that HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's decisions, which makes them unpredictable, though rates are expected to see a slight decline later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates influenced by mortgage bond trading, making them more stable once locked in. Experts advise borrowers to consider their immediate needs and risk tolerance when choosing between the two options. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts believe that by offering a powerful and potentially cheaper alternative, Baidu could disrupt the market, forcing competitors to reconsider their pricing and business strategies.

          <p>German companies are increasingly looking to Taiwan as an alternative source for drones and their components, aiming to reduce reliance on the Chinese-dominated global market. A recent report shows Germany became the second-largest importer of Taiwanese drones in the first quarter of 2025. This shift is driven by growing cybersecurity concerns and Western pressure on China over its ties to Russia. While a complete decoupling is unrealistic, Germany is focused on diversifying its supply of critical components like software and sensors, areas where Taiwan's advanced tech industry can provide "non-red" alternatives.</p>

Discovered within the genome of marine plankton, this archaeal entity has an extremely small genome and appears to outsource most metabolic functions to a host, similar to a virus. However, unlike a virus, it contains the genes necessary to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA, which are essential for protein synthesis. This unique combination of traits places it in a gray area between a minimal cellular organism and a complex virus, potentially reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.</p>
