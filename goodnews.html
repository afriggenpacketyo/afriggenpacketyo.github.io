          <p>Onosato has been promoted to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after only 13 professional tournaments, setting a record pace. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since 2017, expressing his commitment to uphold the rank's honor. He secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, meeting the requirement of consecutive championships as an ozeki. Onosato is set to compete against Mongolian yokozuna Hoshoryu and is the first wrestler to become yokozuna without a single losing record, with his stablemaster hoping he will lead by example and inspire others.</p>

          <p>China has released a plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturing sector, focusing on self-sufficiency in key technologies like semiconductors, batteries, and AI. The plan aims for over 85% of manufacturers to use computer numerical control in key processes by 2027 and to cultivate at least 100 specialized service providers. By 2030, China intends to complete a core industrial database, enabling IT manufacturers to achieve breakthroughs and ascend the global value chain. This initiative aligns with the "Made in China 2025" program and seeks to sidestep US tech restrictions.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law that mandates 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually, covering about 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive maximum emission allowances and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their limits, incentivizing emissions reduction. While aimed at lowering emissions, the system may lead to price increases for consumers due to decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO exhibits a rare characteristic, with existing shareholders selling more shares (60%) than the company itself. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where 57% of shares came from stakeholders. While Circle didn't specify a reason, the move likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and stands to raise $240 million in the IPO, but private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors. (not investment advice)</p>
