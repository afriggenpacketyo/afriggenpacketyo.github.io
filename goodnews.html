          <h2>Gold Prices Poised to Potentially Reach New High This Week</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 13:29:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of gold is anticipated to potentially reach a new high this week, surpassing the $3,400 per ounce mark, due to the recent uptick in inflation. The inflation report release indicated a 0.1% rise in May, deviating from the Federal Reserve's desired downward trend, which has historically driven investors to gold as a safe-haven asset. Geopolitical tensions also contribute to the potential price surge, and with the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates, a drop in gold prices is unlikely. While a price surge is possible, prospective investors should approach gold strategically, limiting it to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

He expressed disappointment with former players who publicly criticized his decision, despite privately offering support, emphasizing the need for unity among fans. The player's decision to prioritize his well-being reflects the need for athletes to make informed choices about their careers.</p>

          <p>A JetBlue flight arriving at Boston's Logan Airport from Chicago veered off the runway and onto the grass on Thursday morning, with no reported injuries. The Airbus A220 landed shortly before noon, prompting a response from fire engines and emergency vehicles. Runway 33-L was temporarily closed for assessment, and passengers were deplaned via stairs and bused to the terminal. The FAA issued a ground stop for departures out of Logan Airport, causing delays of 30 minutes or more, while JetBlue stated that safety is their top priority and that they will conduct a full investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jensen Huang's charitable foundation has experienced substantial growth, increasing from $828 million in assets to over $9.1 billion in the past five years, primarily due to Nvidia shares donated by Huang. This growth has elevated the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation to one of the 15 largest private foundations in the U.S., rivaling established philanthropies. As a result of the increased assets, the foundation is required to distribute a larger amount annually, estimated at $369 million this year. The foundation's infrastructure is still developing, and the majority of its disbursements go to donor-advised funds, providing flexibility in grant decisions.</p>

While the valuation is lower than previous private market valuations, it signals a potential opening for the fintech IPO market after a period of stagnation. Chime reported $518.7 million in revenue for the most recent quarter, with a net income of $12.9 million, and aims to serve Americans earning $100,000 or less.</p>

          <p>The dollar experienced a significant decline, reaching its lowest level in over three years, while the FTSE 100 achieved a record high due to Donald Trump's trade threats and a weakening U.S. economy. Investors shifted away from the dollar towards the yen and the euro, influenced by recent data indicating a softening job market and uncertainty surrounding White House policies. The decline followed Trump's renewed threat to impose country-specific tariff rates, further unsettling markets and prompting speculation about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The UK is expected to get a trade boost after Trump indicated that he would put into force the bilateral trade deal signed with Keir Starmer last month.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is unusually competitive, featuring former Governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, amidst a field of a dozen candidates vying for the Democratic primary. The city employs ranked-choice voting, a system that allows voters to rank up to five candidates, which could lead to an unexpected outcome. Cuomo, despite his experience and financial backing, faces significant opposition due to past scandals, while Mamdani, a young progressive, has gained traction with his grassroots campaign and progressive policies. The ranked-choice system adds complexity to the race, influencing candidate strategies and voter decision-making.</p>
