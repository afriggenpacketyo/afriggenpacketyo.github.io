While researching his novel, Harris was granted access to Vatican areas typically off-limits, but finds it strange that women are excluded from the Catholic priesthood and the election for a new Pope.</p>

          <p>Reform performed well in recent local council elections, winning the most votes and seats, and gaining overall control of several councils. The party's success is attributed to its popularity among those who voted for Brexit in 2016 and Boris Johnson in 2019, indicating it is more than a short-lived protest vote. Reform's appeal is concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right, and its support is stronger in working-class areas with more conservative views on immigration. Both the Conservatives and Labour face challenges in regaining support from this segment of the electorate.</p>
