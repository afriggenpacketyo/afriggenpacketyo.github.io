        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine has claimed responsibility for a large-scale drone attack, dubbed "Operation Spider's Web," targeting Russian airbases deep within Russia, with President Zelenskyy overseeing the operation which reportedly took over a year and a half to plan and execute. According to Ukrainian sources, the attacks, launched from mobile wooden cabins, destroyed a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet and air missile carriers, with estimated damages of billions of dollars. Russia confirmed the attacks but downplayed the extent of the damage, calling it a "terrorist act", while the White House stated they were not informed in advance. The strikes occurred as representatives from both countries prepared for another round of ceasefire talks in Istanbul, raising questions about the timing and potential impact on negotiations. The author's tone suggests cautious optimism about the potential for a shift in the conflict's dynamics. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Yankees avoided a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 in a game where Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto had a rare poor performance. Yamamoto, who had been a consistent performer for the Dodgers, struggled with his command and was pulled in the fourth inning after giving up a season-high in hits. The Dodgers also made defensive and baserunning mistakes that cost them early runs. While the Dodgers showed some late-game offensive spark, it was not enough to overcome the Yankees' lead, resulting in a loss and scrutiny over their inconsistent start to the season. </p>

          <p>The Seattle Sounders protested the bonus structure for the Club World Cup, wearing shirts that read "Club World Ca$h Grab" during their warm-up. The MLS Players Association supports the protest, arguing that FIFA's new tournament increases players' workload without regard for their well-being. While FIFA will pay MLS teams substantial amounts to participate, the current collective bargaining agreement limits players' earnings from outside tournaments. The players have sought to meet with MLS to change the arrangement, but the league has not offered a reasonable proposal. </p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, sparking controversy. The government says the law is needed to increase black ownership of land, while critics argue it threatens property rights. The law allows expropriation without compensation in rare circumstances, such as when land is needed for public interest or when an owner is not using the land. Compensation rules are also set to change, with owners likely to receive less money. </p>
