          <p>Angels star Mike Trout hit his 400th career home run, a significant milestone that prompts reflection on his illustrious but injury-hampered career. Despite recent seasons marked by frequent stints on the injured list, Trout remains a dominant force, known for his power and ability to get on base. Comparisons to legends like Mickey Mantle highlight what could have been without injuries, yet his three MVP awards and consistent top-five finishes solidify his Hall of Fame status. Trout, a private individual who prioritizes personal values over commercial promotion, has twice bypassed free agency to remain loyal to the Angels, earning him the moniker "Mr. Angel" among fans.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly poised to become the first female CEO of Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national rail operator. Transport Minister Patrick Schneider is expected to announce the appointment, along with his plans for the company, on Monday. Palla, 52, joined Deutsche Bahn in 2019 and previously led its regional subsidiary, DB Regio, where she implemented a decentralized management approach. Her appointment follows the dismissal of former CEO Richard Lutz amidst widespread delays and cancellations that led to significant compensation payouts in 2024. The restructuring aims to modernize Germany's transport infrastructure and address the company's persistent operational challenges.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, a ship's cook, embarked on what she expected to be a three-month voyage from Europe to Central America in late 2019, only to find herself stranded at sea for 188 days due to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. Her 100-year-old schooner, the Avontuur, faced closed ports, canceled flights, and supply shortages, preventing the crew from disembarking or returning home. Confined with 15 others, Baccosi managed food rationing, improvised cooking solutions, and witnessed growing tensions and unique human connections amidst the isolation. The unexpected journey highlighted the global impact of the pandemic on even the most remote travelers, ultimately changing Baccosi's perspective on life at sea.</p>

          <p>Indian director Anuparna Roy made history at the Venice Film Festival, winning the Orizzonti Award for her debut film, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." Roy, from a tribal village in West Bengal, self-funded her initial short film before securing backing for her feature. The film, set in Mumbai, explores the intimate relationship between two migrant women navigating same-sex desire and shared experiences of marginality. Critics praised its "anguished portrait of what it takes for women to survive" and its subtle exploration of urban alienation through an observational style. Roy's personal background, including inspirations from her grandmother and a childhood friend, deeply informs the political and social themes of the article.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk predicts that by 2030, AI and robots will replace nearly all jobs, leading to a future of "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance." He envisions a society where everyone enjoys the "best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else," with intelligent humanoid robots far outnumbering humans. Musk argues that a mere universal basic income wouldn't suffice when machines handle most labor, necessitating a more generous system. While this vision offers sci-fi optimism, critics question the feasibility of funding such a system given current economic challenges and political roadblocks, with many wondering how the entire economic structure would be rethought to support such widespread prosperity.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jane Austen's classic novel 'Emma' has been adapted for the 21st-century stage by Ava Pickett, setting the story in a modern Essex nightclub scene. The adaptation, playing at London's Rose Theatre, features Emma Woodhouse as a meddling, quick-witted protagonist who interferes with her friends' online dating profiles after failing at Oxford. Pickett, drawing from her own experiences, explores themes of self-worth derived from social media validation and the complexities of modern relationships. The play updates the Regency-era narrative with contemporary elements like dating apps and clubbing, while retaining Austen's core insights into human nature, love, and friendship, aiming to resonate with modern audiences.</p>

          <h2>Research Explores Creatine's Potential to Combat Brain Fog and Boost Cognitive Function</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is gaining attention for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in combating brain fog. Originally known for enhancing athletic performance, new research suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. Dr. Henry Chung notes its shift from elite sport to mainstream use, especially among women in their 40s experiencing perimenopausal brain fog. While studies are still limited, some individuals, like Katie Mansell, report improved clarity and motivation after taking creatine, alongside other treatments. Experts like Professor Trevor McMorris suggest it might work by increasing brain creatine stores, thereby boosting energy for cognitive processes, especially under stress, though more research is needed to confirm widespread efficacy and potential side effects.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a new deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, asserting that American companies will control the app's algorithm and hold six of seven board seats. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a signing is imminent, though Beijing has yet to confirm. This agreement aims to address national security concerns regarding the video-sharing app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, after President Trump previously threatened a ban. Oracle, chaired by Trump ally Larry Ellison, will manage data and privacy for the U.S. operations. The deal signifies a significant shift in control over the popular platform, which Trump had increasingly used for his presidential campaign.</p>
