          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The strike, which began over disputes regarding pay and unpaid work, stranded over 100,000 travelers globally during the peak summer season. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu ordered the workers back, referring the matter to the Canada Industrial Relations Board for binding arbitration to resolve the contract impasse. The airline warns that while flights will restart Sunday evening, it will take several days for the schedule to fully normalize, with some cancellations expected over the next week.</p>

          <p>After nearly a quarter-century of separation, an undocumented immigrant in California was emotionally reunited with his elderly parents from Zacatecas, Mexico. The reunion was made possible through a program that helps Mexican citizens secure temporary visitor visas to see family in the U.S. For years, José Antonio Rodríguez had only connected with his parents through phone calls and letters while working as a carpenter and sending money home. The poignant event, hosted in East Los Angeles, highlights the profound personal impact of immigration policies and the deep-seated desire for family connection across borders.</p>

Hui, a former lawmaker, was among several activists targeted by police with bounties for their arrest. In a social media post, he expressed gratitude to the Australian government for its protection while also conveying the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return home. He urged Australia to continue advocating for other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their political activities.</p>

The All Blacks established a strong first-half lead in Cordoba, with winger Sevu Reece scoring two of the team's six tries. Despite a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas that narrowed the gap to seven points, New Zealand secured the win with two late tries from substitute Samisoni Taukei'aho.

          <p>The S&P 500 recently concluded a 68-day streak of closing above its 20-day moving average, a technical indicator of short-term momentum. This event has occurred only eight other times since 1957. Historical data analysis shows that in seven of those eight instances, the index was higher 12 months later, with an average gain of 11%. While past performance is not a guarantee of future results, this historical pattern suggests a bullish outlook for the market. However, ongoing economic uncertainties, such as tariff negotiations and inflation, could still introduce volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on how her appreciation for Renaissance art evolved from youthful indifference to a profound connection shaped by life events. Initially dismissing the genre as unrelatable, she found new meaning in its depictions of complex human emotions after experiencing trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood. The author contrasts her early cynicism with her later ability to be moved by works like Piero della Francesca’s "Madonna del Parto" and Raphael's Madonnas. The piece concludes that life experience opens one up to the emotional depth of historical art, making it resonate in powerful and unexpected ways.</p>

          <p>Phoenix police captured a serial killer responsible for two murders in the early 1990s through an undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant in 2015. Detectives met with a person of interest, Bryan Patrick Miller, under the guise of an informal conversation to secretly obtain his DNA from a water glass. Miller, known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character, was not initially considered a strong suspect by the lead detective. However, the DNA from the glass provided a direct match to evidence found on the victims, leading to his immediate arrest, eventual conviction, and a death sentence in 2023.</p>

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by the renowned 19th-century painter Ilya Repin, who was born in the Russian Empire in what is now Ukraine. The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, features 48 oil paintings and aims to emphasize the artist's "Russianness." This focus comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin's work as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition showcases different periods of the artist's life, from his studies in St. Petersburg to his later years on the Gulf of Finland.</p>
