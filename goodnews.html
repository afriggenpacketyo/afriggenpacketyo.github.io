          <p>President Trump has stated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, which would see the business sold to a group of American investors. However, Chinese state media offered a more ambiguous account, stating that Beijing welcomes negotiations. A key point of contention appears to be the ownership of the powerful algorithm that serves content to TikTok's 170 million American users. The leaders also reportedly plan to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for the next several days. While its current track keeps it away from the Caribbean islands and the U.S. mainland, the system could pass east of Bermuda next week. So far, the 2025 hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by forecasters.</p>

          <p>A trade fair in Nanning, China, is serving as a crucial platform for Chinese companies looking to pivot their export focus towards Southeast Asia. Facing slowing demand from traditional markets in Europe and the United States, these firms are attracted to the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base. Many businesses see the annual China-ASEAN Expo as a gateway to establish new connections and expand their international presence. This shift reflects a broader strategic realignment in global trade as Chinese manufacturers seek new avenues for growth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Trump against The New York Times, citing the complaint's "improper and impermissible" language. The judge ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was excessively long and resembled a political speech rather than a professional legal document. While the judge did not rule on the legal merits of the case, he gave Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended, more concise complaint. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by the newspaper's reporters were intended to harm his 2024 presidential campaign.</p>

He, along with other models, is calling on the government to regulate generative AI, which can create realistic human images and make models, photographers, and makeup artists redundant. Gandy, who became a household name through his Dolce & Gabbana campaigns, also spoke about his desire for privacy, keeping his family life separate from his public persona, and his inspiration from the original female supermodels.</p>

          <p>A recent flurry of multi-billion-pound investments in the UK by American tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft has been championed by the government as a sign of the nation's future as an "AI superpower." Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed surprise at British pessimism, praising the country's research capabilities. However, the growing reliance on U.S. capital has drawn criticism from figures like Sir Nick Clegg, who warned that Britain was just getting "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table." The trend suggests the UK economy may become a key laboratory for U.S. tech firms, aligning it closely with American policy in the global AI race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show, held in a Los Angeles Salvadoran restaurant, provides a vital and welcoming venue for Latinx and other underrepresented comedians. Created by producer Justin Alexio, the show combines food and culture, allowing comics to perform for a supportive audience and joke about the immigrant experience. In a competitive L.A. scene where Latinx comics often struggle for bookings, the event has grown from a monthly show to a sold-out weekly staple. It fosters a sense of community for both performers and audience members who connect over shared food and experiences.</p>
