Saigo holed out her second shot from 214 yards on the par-5 3rd hole at Seaview's Bay Course, contributing to her 6-under-par 65. She is now one stroke behind the leader, Lee Il Hee of South Korea, alongside fellow Japanese golfer Ayaka Furue and Americans Jennifer Kupcho and Elizabeth Szokol. Saigo expressed satisfaction with her score despite admitting her iron play and tee shots weren't as accurate as she would have liked, however she was happy with her score.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an artificial retina using the rare mineral tellurium, successfully restoring sight and granting "super vision" to blind animals. The device, composed of tellurium nanowire implants, enabled genetically blind mice and a monkey to see visible and infrared light. Tellurium's excellent photoelectric properties allow it to convert light into electrical energy, serving as a replacement for damaged photoreceptor cells in the retina. This advancement presents a promising avenue for treating human blindness, offering the potential to restore sight and enhance visual capabilities. The study highlights China's growing role in scientific innovation and the potential of rare minerals in medical applications.</p>

The 53-year-old also mentioned that she has considered plastic surgery but has been advised against it by doctors, though she hasn't ruled it out for the future. Garner emphasized the importance of sunscreen for maintaining a youthful appearance and expressed gratitude for starting sun protection early in life. She also reflected on the gift of not stressing too much about her physical appearance, attributing it to her upbringing, and embraced the idea of aging gracefully.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Male Childcare Subsidies Could Help Ease China's Demographic Crisis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 23:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates, particularly in countries like China facing demographic challenges. The research, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, indicates that subsidies for fathers yield greater long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. China's rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system highlight the urgency of addressing declining fertility rates. The study also reveals that traditional expectations placing the burden of childcare on women persist in China and other East Asian countries, conflicting with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. While some venture capitalists advocate for overwork to compete globally, many founders argue that it leads to decreased retention and burnout. Instead, they emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation cultures, access to funding, and work-life balance. The debate highlights the differences in values and regulations between Europe and other regions, as well as the need for a stronger startup ecosystem in Europe.</p>

By treating AI as children, people may be more inclined to become better role models and guide AI's development in a positive direction.

This initiative, spearheaded by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, seeks to revitalize regional economies by promoting tourism, donations, and relocation. Registered nonresidents would receive information on local events and services, though the program's success hinges on providing tangible benefits to participants.
