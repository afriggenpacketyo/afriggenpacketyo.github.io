          <p>South Korea is holding a snap election on June 3 amidst economic and political shocks following President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law decree. Voters are seeking stability and a leader who can calm the economic downturn and protests that have plagued the country. Liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung is leading in the polls, promising to restore stability, while conservative candidate Kim Moon-soo is campaigning on deregulation. The martial law declaration has negatively impacted businesses and consumer sentiment, potentially leading to a significant loss of votes for the ruling conservative party.

          <p>A surprising number of Hollywood stars are Australian, and this article explores why the country produces so much acting talent. NIDA, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, is a key factor, instilling a "can do, will tell, you know, don't wait for permission" attitude. Australian actors are known for their skill, confidence, and courage, as well as a lack of self-indulgence. The country's remoteness allows actors to develop their talents away from Hollywood's intense scrutiny. The Australian film industry also provides a good training ground for actors to hone their skills.</p>
