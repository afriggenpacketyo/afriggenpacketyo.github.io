          <p>Meta has filed a lawsuit against Joy Timeline HK Ltd., the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI to generate nonconsensual, sexualized images of individuals. The lawsuit, filed in Hong Kong, aims to prevent Joy Timeline from advertising on Meta's platforms after repeated attempts to circumvent ad review processes. Meta emphasized the seriousness of the abuse and its commitment to protecting users, also announcing updates to enforcement methods and technology to detect and remove similar ads. The company plans to share signals about these apps with other tech companies to address the issue across platforms, disrupting networks of accounts promoting these services. The goal is to combat the proliferation of 'nudify' apps and safeguard the online community from abuse.</p>

          <p>Former NFL Pro Bowl offensive lineman Taylor Lewan shared an anecdote about being roasted by President Donald Trump regarding a poor first pitch he threw at a St. Louis Cardinals game. Lewan and Will Compton encountered Trump at UFC 316 in Newark, New Jersey, where Trump jokingly criticized Lewan's throwing ability. Lewan's errant pitch had previously drawn mockery on social media, with comparisons to 50 Cent's infamous first pitch, and Lewan humorously expressed his need for redemption after the incident. He took the criticism in stride and seems to be making light of the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium, but recent government support, including a ban on Russian uranium imports and federal funding for domestic enrichment, aims to change this. Experts estimate that known uranium deposits will run out by 2080 if nuclear energy demand continues to grow, with domestic uranium miners working to ramp up production. Despite these efforts, the U.S. is expected to remain reliant on other countries for uranium due to limited domestic reserves.</p>

          <p>India's consumer inflation has eased to 2.82% in May, lower than expected, primarily due to a decrease in food prices, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The year-on-year headline inflation is the lowest since February 2019, with food inflation hitting 0.99%. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5.50%. Economists expect further rate cuts, while India's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected rate of 7.4% in the quarter ended March. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Some mothers are actively trying to delay their daughters' first periods, driven by concerns about the effects of chemicals and the trend of earlier menarche. The average age of menarche in the US has shifted earlier, which is associated with increased risks of certain health conditions. These parents are focusing on changes to diet, personal care products, and screen time to mitigate potential risks. Experts suggest that limiting exposure to endocrine disruptors is reasonable, but caution against hypervigilance and potential risks of eating disorders, while advocating for broader societal and policy changes.</p>
