        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of families are selling their multigenerational "trophy" ranches in states like California, Wyoming, and Montana, often due to disagreements among heirs or a lack of interest from the younger generation in managing the properties. High-end brokers report a surge in listings for these historic, large-acreage estates, which are in high demand from wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect. While sellers gain a financial windfall, they also face the emotional difficulty of parting with a family legacy and a unique way of life. The trend reflects a significant generational transfer of wealth.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris set the fastest time during Friday's practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, narrowly outpacing Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso. Despite his strong performance, Alonso downplayed his team's chances of competing for a front-row start, suggesting top teams like Red Bull and Mercedes remain the primary contenders. The sessions were eventful, with several drivers, including Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen, experiencing spins or going off track, and Lance Stroll crashing his Aston Martin. Teams are now preparing for potentially rainy conditions during Saturday's qualifying.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The court upheld a lower court's decision, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely overstepped its authority by attempting to rescind a prior TPS extension without statutory permission. This ruling provides a reprieve for individuals who fled political and economic crises in Venezuela, allowing them to continue living and working in the United States while the legal battle continues. The decision underscores the judiciary's role in reviewing executive actions concerning immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she will not seek a third term in 2026, with an official announcement expected soon. First elected in 2015, Ernst has risen to a leadership position within the Republican conference and has been a consistent supporter of President Trump's agenda. Sources indicate her decision stems from an intention to serve only two terms before transitioning to the private sector. Her departure will open up a key Senate seat, adding another competitive race to the 2026 midterm elections as several other Republican senators are also retiring.</p>

          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged over 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations. CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to robust consumer spending and growth in merchant partnerships, particularly with Shopify and Amazon, which offset the loss of Walmart as a client. The company also issued optimistic guidance for the upcoming quarter and fiscal year, signaling confidence in its business model despite increasing competition. The growth of its Affirm Card and the successful deployment of new AI systems were also highlighted as key drivers of its recent success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders in California have announced a landmark agreement with Uber and Lyft that will permit their drivers to unionize and engage in collective bargaining. This compromise allows drivers to negotiate pay and working conditions while maintaining their classification as independent contractors, a status established by the voter-approved Proposition 22. The deal involves passing a collective bargaining bill alongside another bill, supported by the companies, that will lower their insurance coverage requirements. This agreement marks a significant turning point in the long-standing conflict between gig economy companies and organized labor over worker rights.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," Dr. Sanjay Gupta discusses the evolving science of chronic pain, emphasizing a shift toward "reverse translational research." This approach begins with a patient's real-life experience rather than starting in a lab, aiming to identify objective biomarkers for a subjective condition. He highlights groundbreaking studies where brain implants have successfully mapped, predicted, and even interrupted pain signals using deep brain stimulation. While not yet a widespread cure, this research demonstrates that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and treatable, offering new hope for millions of sufferers.</p>

          <p>For savers seeking stable returns without the volatility of the stock market, a certificate of deposit (CD) offers a predictable option with currently high interest rates. A $30,000 deposit in a CD could earn anywhere from over $300 for a three-month term to more than $6,700 for a five-year term, based on current average rates. The article highlights that locking in these fixed rates now can be advantageous, as they will provide consistent returns even if the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in the future. However, potential depositors must weigh the benefit of a fixed rate against the lack of liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Gaming Association estimates that a record $30 billion will be legally wagered by Americans on the 2025 NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for the season, but they face growing competition from both established rivals and unlicensed offshore betting sites. In response to the threat from illegal operators, which cost states an estimated $4 billion in tax revenue, law enforcement and attorneys general are increasing their crackdown efforts. Recent data suggests that states with active enforcement against illegal sites see significantly higher growth in their legal betting markets.</p>
