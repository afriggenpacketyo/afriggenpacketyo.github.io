        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As countries like South Korea pivot towards stablecoins, questions arise about how they compare to central bank digital currencies like China's digital yuan. The digital yuan, or e-CNY, is a state-controlled currency intended primarily for small domestic retail payments and is not exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, backed by reserve assets. While the digital yuan operates under the central bank's authority, stablecoins represent a decentralized approach to digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States is preparing for its 250th anniversary in 2026 with a series of events and initiatives under the 'America 250' banner. Coordinated by both a congressional commission and a White House task force, the commemoration aims to be the largest in the nation's history. Planned projects include a student field trip program to national landmarks, a proposed National Garden of American Heroes, and a traveling tech expo. While organizers are seeking $150 million from Congress, funding is also being sourced from corporate sponsorships and redirected federal grants, with states also planning their own local celebrations.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a high-profile socialist victory in a New York primary, the future leaders of the Democratic Party are pragmatic, center-left figures like Representatives Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger. Both women, nominees for governor in New Jersey and Virginia respectively, have a track record of winning competitive districts by focusing on consensus-building and kitchen-table economic issues. The author suggests that while progressive activism is important, the electoral success and governing style of Sherrill and Spanberger provide a more viable model for building durable Democratic majorities nationally, prioritizing persuasion over ideological purity.</p>

          <h2>Tracing the Roots of Barbecue to Indigenous Caribbean Traditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The quintessential American tradition of barbecue has its origins with the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The term itself evolved from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frame they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers in the 15th century observed this method and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first recorded in print in 1526. Over centuries, this cooking style and its name transformed as it spread, blending with local and immigrant influences across the U.S. to create the diverse regional barbecue styles known today.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill includes a provision to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This move is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced manufacturing facilities within the United States. The proposed credits build upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting a continued push from Washington to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia. The bill must still pass the House, but if enacted, it could accelerate domestic investment in the critical chip industry. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, the Tibetan spiritual leader affirmed that his reincarnation should be found according to traditional Buddhist practices, signaling that China should not interfere in the process. Beijing has long insisted it has the sole authority to approve the next leader. The decision is politically significant for Tibetans who oppose Chinese rule and is expected to lead to rival successors being named.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a massive new resort on its eastern coast, to domestic visitors. State media reported that the resort, a pet project of leader Kim Jong Un, can accommodate nearly 20,000 people and is part of a broader effort to develop the country's tourism industry. The opening comes as North Korea slowly reopens its borders following the pandemic, with Russian tourist groups also expected to visit the site soon. The project highlights Pyongyang's focus on tourism as a potential source of foreign currency amid international sanctions.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweler Laopu Gold jumped 15% to a record high, defying concerns that a massive release of shares would cause a price drop. The surge occurred after a one-year lock-up period ended, allowing 69 million shares held by pre-listing investors to be traded freely. Instead of a sell-off, investors eagerly bought the stock, which has soared over 1,300% since its 2024 debut. Analysts attribute the strong investor confidence to the company's powerful branding, pricing power, and potential for growth in both domestic and overseas markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has signaled a crackdown on the intense price wars affecting many of the country's industries. At a key economic meeting, officials used the pointed phrase "disorderly low-price competition" to describe the issue, indicating a more direct approach than previous, vaguer terms. Beijing aims to regulate this behavior to protect innovation, improve product quality, and encourage the phasing out of outdated production capacity. The move is seen as crucial for the long-term health of the Chinese economy and its industrial upgrading goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major NBA free agency surprise, longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner has agreed to a four-year, $107 million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star guard Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will likely miss most or all of the upcoming season. Lillard will now be an unrestricted free agent, able to sign with any team while continuing his rehabilitation. The move signals a significant roster shake-up for both the Bucks and the Pacers, who are facing a season without their own injured star, Tyrese Haliburton.</p>
