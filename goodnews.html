          <p>Scientists are exploring a new method to track the world's biodiversity by collecting and analyzing DNA from the air. Researchers have found that air quality monitoring stations can inadvertently capture airborne DNA from various species, allowing for a nationwide census of living things. This approach could provide valuable insights into species distribution, conservation efforts, and the impact of environmental disruptions. The article explores the potential of this technique to revolutionize biodiversity monitoring on a global scale.</p>
