          <p>The athletic shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit from customers who allege that its popular sneakers, featuring "CloudTec" soles, develop a "noisy and embarrassing squeak." The lawsuit claims that the design, which includes holes in the sole, causes rubber components to rub together and create the sound. Plaintiffs argue that no reasonable consumer would pay a premium price for the shoes knowing they would become unwearable due to the noise. The company has reportedly declined to comment on the allegations, which cite numerous similar complaints on social media platforms.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told President Donald Trump that he has a "big chance" to end Russia's war on Ukraine. Zelenskyy was in Washington to make a case for acquiring long-range Tomahawk missiles, which he believes could pressure Russia into negotiations. Trump expressed a desire to see the fighting stop and mentioned a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but also voiced concerns about depleting the U.S. military's own missile supply. The discussion highlighted the delicate balance between arming Ukraine and pursuing a diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>Aziz Ansari's writing-directing debut, "Good Fortune," is a comedy about economic disparity starring Ansari, Seth Rogen, and Keanu Reeves as an angel named Gabriel. The film follows a struggling gig worker who swaps lives with a wealthy venture capitalist, exploring themes of wealth and happiness. The review praises Reeves's deadpan performance as a highlight, calling it one of his best roles in years. However, it suggests the film ultimately struggles to effectively merge its sharp satirical jabs at capitalism with its sentimental, feel-good narrative ambitions.</p>

          <p>The Monterey Bay Aquarium has raised nearly $2.2 million for its sea otter program after re-releasing a vintage 1990s T-shirt design that was spotted on Taylor Swift. After the singer-songwriter wore the shirt in a film, her fans, known as "Swifties," began making donations to the aquarium. In response, the institution launched a limited-time fundraiser offering reprints of the classic shirt, which hit its initial goal in just seven hours. The aquarium credited the unexpected spotlight with bringing a new era of support and awareness to its ocean conservation work.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Identify Safest Annuity Options in Current Economic Climate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 14:38:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic environment, financial experts suggest that fixed annuities are the safest option for investors and retirees seeking stability. These insurance products offer a guaranteed interest rate for a set period, protecting the principal investment from market volatility, similar to a certificate of deposit. With interest rates remaining relatively elevated despite recent decreases, locking in a fixed annuity can provide predictable, tax-deferred growth. The article also discusses other safe options, such as multi-year guaranteed annuities (MYGAs) and single premium immediate annuities (SPIAs), depending on an individual's financial goals.

          <h2>Arizona Officials Warn Public Against Licking Sonoran Desert Toads for Psychedelic Effects</h2>

          <p>Following heavy rainfall in the Phoenix area, Arizona officials are warning residents not to lick the Sonoran Desert toad. This amphibian, which has appeared in greater numbers, secretes a potent neurotoxin containing a psychoactive compound as a defense mechanism. Some people reportedly seek to ingest the toxin to experience its psychedelic effects, but health experts warn this is extremely dangerous and can lead to severe illness or even death. The public is advised to avoid contact with the toads and to keep pets away from them as well.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump prepares to visit his home state of Florida, recent polling data indicates he maintains a net positive approval rating there. According to a Morning Consult survey, 51% of registered voters in Florida approve of his job performance, while 45% disapprove. This contrasts with his national numbers and his ratings in key swing states, where his approval has recently become net negative. The data provides a snapshot of his political standing in a state where his allies have been actively supporting his initiatives.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Mortgage Interest Rates Could Decline Before Federal Reserve's Next Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 14:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There is a strong possibility that mortgage interest rates could fall before the Federal Reserve's next meeting on October 29, where another rate cut is widely expected. Historically, mortgage lenders often "price in" anticipated Fed actions, causing rates to drop in the days or weeks leading up to an official announcement rather than after. This pattern was observed before Fed cuts in both September 2024 and September 2025. Prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to monitor the market closely to capitalize on any potential, albeit temporary, dip in rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Africa secured a commanding 10-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a Women's World Cup match that was shortened by rain. Chasing a revised target of 121 runs, the South African team reached the goal with ease inside 15 overs, thanks to an unbeaten opening partnership from captain Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits. This fourth consecutive win moves South Africa up to second place in the tournament standings. The defeat leaves co-hosts Sri Lanka winless and with very slim hopes of advancing to the semi-finals.</p>

          <p>California's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against three major plastic bag manufacturers, accusing them of violating state law by falsely marketing their products as recyclable. According to the state's investigation, the thicker plastic bags sold in stores since the 2014 ban on single-use bags are not accepted at the vast majority of California's recycling facilities. In a related action, the state also announced a settlement with four other producers who will stop selling the bags and pay over $1.7 million in penalties for making similar unsubstantiated claims.</p>

          <p>The traditional 60/40 stock and bond investment portfolio is facing a new challenge as the record-breaking surge in gold and cryptocurrencies gains prominence. Some market strategists and investors are now advocating for a 60/20/20 model, where the 20% previously allocated to bonds is split between fixed income and alternative assets like gold. This shift is driven by the observation that stocks and bonds are often moving in the same direction, diminishing bonds' effectiveness as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk.
