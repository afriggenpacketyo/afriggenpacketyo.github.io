          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may result in a reduction of 1,700 roles globally by 2027, aiming for ¬£60 million in cost savings. This follows ¬£40 million in cost-cutting measures announced in November. CEO Joshua Schulman is implementing this strategy to revive the brand's fortunes amid a difficult macroeconomic environment and geopolitical uncertainty. Shares rose 8.5% after the announcement, and sales fell less than expected in the fiscal fourth quarter, although they declined across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading before ultimately rising after the company revealed a share buyback program worth 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of common stock shares to shareholders. However, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster by some analysts.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to reduce most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend reciprocal duties for 90 days, signaling a potential de-escalation in their trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump called it a "total reset" with China, leading to tariff cuts on both sides. However, some tariffs and non-tariff countermeasures remain in place, with further negotiations planned to address ongoing trade relationship issues. The agreement also includes establishing an economic and trade consultation mechanism.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Observed Using Forest Plants for First Aid</h2>

          <p>Scientists have observed wild chimpanzees in Uganda using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and injuries, demonstrating a form of forest first aid. The chimpanzees were seen dabbing plants on their wounds or chewing them and applying the chewed material to the injury. This research builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate with certain plants, adding to evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy. Researchers also noted instances of chimpanzees tending to the wounds of unrelated individuals, suggesting empathy.</p>

          <p>Despite easing trade tensions with the United States, China is expected to maintain a tough stance on its regional territorial claims and military competition. While seeking economic and diplomatic opportunities across Asia, Beijing is unlikely to soften its approach to territorial disputes. China's government remains on edge over Taiwan and continues to assert its claims in the South China Sea, balancing economic incentives with assertive actions.</p>

          <p>As President Trump reduces funding for American research institutions, world leaders are seizing the opportunity to attract talented researchers. Countries like France, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden are offering financial incentives, academic freedom, and social security benefits to lure American scientists and academics. This effort aims to reverse the brain drain and strengthen research capabilities in other nations.</p>
