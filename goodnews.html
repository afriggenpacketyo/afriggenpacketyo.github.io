          <p>According to reports, the Israeli military has halted offensive operations in the Gaza Strip to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages as part of a U.S.-brokered peace initiative. An Israeli official clarified this is not a formal ceasefire and that tactical adjustments will be made to protect troops, with a warning that Israel will not permit Hamas to exploit the pause. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt to finalize details, while President Trump has issued a warning to Hamas to act quickly on the deal.</p>

          <p>Costco has partnered with drug manufacturer Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications, including Ozempic and Wegovy, to its members at a significantly reduced price. A four-week supply will be available for $499 to members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket, which is roughly half the typical cost. This move aims to provide an affordable and authentic alternative to cheaper, compounded versions of the drugs, as demand soars and many insurance plans still do not cover these medications.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The site, dating back over 3,000 years, is one of the largest in the valley and had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led conservation project began. The tomb features a long, sloping passageway and chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings, offering visitors a renewed glimpse into the art and architecture of Egypt's Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key components of the Gaza peace proposal outlined by President Trump, notably the release of all hostages. In a statement, the group indicated it is prepared to hand over the administration of Gaza to an independent Palestinian body, but suggested other parts of the deal require further negotiation. Following the announcement, President Trump urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, and Israeli officials have begun preparations to implement the plan's first phase.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. After being left off the wild-card series roster, the future Hall of Famer is expected to pitch out of the bullpen, providing a needed left-handed option and veteran presence. This move ensures Kershaw will likely take the mound at least once more before his anticipated retirement, as the team looks to strengthen its pitching depth for the crucial playoff series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 achieving another record-high close despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare, utilities, and information technology sectors were among the week's top performers, buoyed by a deal involving Pfizer and continued investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Market analysts noted that investors seem to be treating the shutdown as a "non-event," with major indices logging their fourth positive week out of the last five and starting the month on a strong footing.

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial analysts are advising investors to diversify by increasing their exposure to overseas markets. Experts argue that "home bias" is particularly strong among American investors, who may be missing out on better value and growth opportunities abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India. These markets are seen as having long-term potential driven by factors like large populations, favorable demographics, and rapid economic growth, mirroring the trajectory China experienced over the past two decades.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled that the Justice Department's human-smuggling prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García may constitute illegal retaliation. The charges were filed shortly after Ábrego successfully sued the Trump administration over his wrongful deportation to El Salvador, a case that reached the Supreme Court. The judge cited "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general and the timing of the investigation as evidence of potential vindictiveness, ordering a hearing to examine the government's motives for pursuing the case against the Salvadoran national.</p>
