          <p>China's exports to Africa have surged by 25%, reaching a total of US$140.8 billion, a growth rate that significantly outpaces its trade with other major regions like Europe and Asia. According to analysts, this sharp increase is a direct consequence of ongoing trade friction and tariffs imposed by the United States on Chinese goods. The trend suggests that Chinese manufacturers are successfully redirecting their products to new and growing markets in Africa to offset the economic pressure from American trade policies.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved an innovative device for treating rheumatoid arthritis in patients who do not respond to traditional drug therapies. The implantable device, made by SetPoint Medical, functions by delivering electrical pulses to the vagus nerve, which in turn signals the brain to reduce the production of inflammation-causing proteins. While not a universal cure, clinical trials demonstrated meaningful improvement in a significant percentage of difficult-to-treat patients, marking a potential turning point for managing autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are calling for mandatory health warnings, similar to those on cigarette packs, to be displayed on social media apps used by children to protect their mental health. The party's proposal aims to alert young users to the risks of "addictive algorithms" and excessive phone usage, which research has linked to anxiety and sleep disruption. In addition to the warnings, the plan includes a two-hour daily cap on accessing algorithm-driven video feeds, often referred to as "doomscrolling," for individuals under the age of 18.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial conducted by Ascletis Pharma in the U.S. has shown that its drug candidate, ASC47, significantly enhances the weight loss effects of semaglutide, a popular obesity treatment. According to the company, when used in combination, the treatment resulted in a 56% greater relative reduction in body weight compared to using semaglutide alone over a four-week period. The study also indicated that ASC47 substantially improved gastrointestinal tolerability, with a much lower incidence of vomiting reported among participants in the combination therapy group.</p>

European captain Luke Donald will rely on experienced pairings to silence the home crowd early, while U.S. captain Keegan Bradley must integrate four rookies into the high-pressure environment, setting the stage for a pivotal start to the competition.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that involves North Korea freezing its nuclear weapons production rather than complete denuclearization. He described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure," given that the North is estimated to be producing 15-20 new weapons annually. This pragmatic stance reflects President Lee's desire to reduce tensions and re-engage Pyongyang in dialogue, acknowledging that the long-term goal of denuclearization is currently unattainable.</p>
