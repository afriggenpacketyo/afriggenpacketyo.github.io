        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan, known for its pacifist constitution, is shifting towards arms exports to deepen ties with allies and enhance its defense industrial base. Defense Minister Gen Nakatani aims to promote defense exports, while Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba attended a defense exhibition, signaling a change in policy. This shift is driven by security concerns and the need to improve interoperability with allies through standardized maintenance and joint training. By exporting arms, Japan seeks to achieve economies of scale and revitalize its domestic defense industry, which has suffered due to reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>Detroit Police Sergeant Shannon Jones, inspired by photographs of missing persons, initiated Operation UNITED to exhume unidentified crime victims and use DNA analysis to solve cold cases.

This operation has led to 33 positive identifications, providing closure for families and restoring victims' identities. Other cities have expressed interest in launching similar projects, highlighting the impact of this innovative approach to solving cold cases. The optimism score is 85.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China is experiencing a surge in tourism, leading to the rise of "emergent" jobs such as hanfu stylists. These stylists cater to tourists who want to dress up in traditional Chinese clothing for photoshoots at historical sites. The growth of this cottage industry reflects the government's promotion of traditional culture and the increasing demand for unique travel experiences. Roughly 306 million trips were made to Xian last year, generating significant tourism income for the region. The optimism score is 75.</p>
