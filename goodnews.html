          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Accepting Luxury Jet Gift from Qatar for Use as Air Force One</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, dubbed a 'palace in the sky,' from the Qatari royal family for President Trump's use as Air Force One. The plane would initially be transferred to the U.S. Air Force for modifications before being handed over to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation by January 1, 2029. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice suggest the arrangement is legally permissible, as the gift is not conditioned on any official act and is given to the Air Force, not an individual. The estimated value of the aircraft is around $400 million, excluding additional security and communication upgrades.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has expressed reservations about reducing the consumption tax as a measure to combat inflation, citing potential adverse effects on state finances. The Prime Minister's comments come as his administration considers an economic package ahead of the House of Councillors election this summer. Other news items include positive comments from President Trump on trade talks with China, the nomination of Kim Moon Soo as South Korea's conservative presidential candidate, and the selection of Cardinal Robert Prevost as the new Pope Leo XIV.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a century of increasing life expectancy, the U.S. has seen a decline, but scientific advancements offer hope for reversing this trend. Cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol suggests five evidence-based steps for a longer, healthier life: knowing and lowering one's biological age through proteomic clocks and DNA-methylation scores, adopting a Mediterranean-style diet rich in whole grains and vegetables, prioritizing deep and consistent sleep, engaging in strength and core training alongside aerobic exercise, and fostering social connections to combat isolation. These changes can significantly impact health and longevity, potentially reducing the risk of diseases associated with aging.</p>
