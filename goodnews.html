          <p>Jorgen Boassen, a former bricklayer from Greenland, has become a political influencer due to his fervent support for President Trump. His advocacy has made him unpopular at home, where he was even assaulted, but has also opened doors to investors and media attention. Boassen envisions a close security alliance between an independent Greenland and the United States, aiming to break away from Denmark's perceived failures in defending the territory. He now works for an organization promoting U.S.-Greenland ties, believing Greenland's future is brightest with America, despite opposition from many Greenlanders who don't want to become part of the United States.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed an algorithm that enables first-person-view (FPV) drones to execute autonomous aerobatic maneuvers. The algorithm allows drones to potentially outperform human pilots in complex flight missions. Aerobatic flight involves high-risk maneuvers typically avoided in conventional aviation, but this technology unlocks new possibilities for drone applications. The breakthrough draws inspiration from the aerial acrobatics observed in nature, where birds and bats use such maneuvers for hunting and obstacle avoidance.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has voiced concerns about cutting the consumption tax as a measure to combat inflation, citing potential strain on state finances. Senior officials within his administration and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party have also expressed reservations about this approach. Ishiba suggests exploring alternative methods to support those truly in need, emphasizing the need for thorough discussions on the financial impact of tax cuts. This comes amid pressure from opposition parties advocating for a consumption tax reduction ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced "great progress" in high-level trade talks between the United States and China, following discussions in Geneva. The talks, which are intended to de-escalate tariff tensions, mark the first face-to-face contact between senior U.S. and Chinese officials since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump expressed a desire to see China open up to American business for the benefit of both countries.

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, has returned to Massachusetts after being released on bail following her detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A federal judge ordered her release after determining that the Trump administration had not provided sufficient evidence for her detainment, besides an op-ed she co-authored. Ozturk and her lawyers argued that her due process and First Amendment rights were violated when she was taken into custody. The judge also noted that Ozturk does not have a criminal record and that there is no record of her engaging or encouraging violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump has claimed a "total reset" in US-China trade relations after the first day of talks between top American and Chinese officials in Geneva, aimed at de-escalating the trade war. He praised the discussions as "very good" and "a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner." The negotiations come after the US imposed tariffs on China, with China responding in kind. Trump suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese goods as a potential alternative, while China stated that its policy of opposing US tariffs has not changed.</p>

Her testimony, along with that of another woman Doyle had attacked, was crucial in establishing a pattern of violent behavior and securing a conviction.

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and U.S. scientists has shown promising results for a new medication, zongertinib, in treating a hard-to-treat type of lung cancer. The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option for HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that zongertinib effectively targets the HER2 protein, blocking the activity of tyrosine kinase, which drives cell growth. This new treatment offers a potential new benchmark for targeted therapy in HER2-mutant NSCLC.</p>

          <p>China's car sales increased for the third consecutive month in April, driven by government-subsidized trade-ins that offset the impact of U.S. tariffs. Passenger vehicle sales totaled 1.78 million units, with new energy vehicles (electric and plug-in hybrids) accounting for over half of the total. While car exports declined, domestic consumer confidence was bolstered by the government's trade-in scheme, which favored NEVs. However, automated-driving systems are becoming less of a sales catalyst due to government scrutiny following a fatal crash involving a Xiaomi SU7 sedan.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual move towards a cashless society, app-based salary payments have struggled to gain traction, two years after their introduction. While over 100 companies offer PayPay as a salary payment method, only a small percentage of workers use such apps. Surveys indicate a lack of perceived benefits and a preference for traditional payment methods. Experts suggest that greater incentives and wider availability to part-time workers could boost adoption, although companies cite limited demand and increased costs as deterrents.</p>

          <p>Amid rising global uncertainties and trade tensions, Chinese consumers are increasingly turning to domestic brands as a statement of national pride. This trend reflects a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation and creativity, particularly among the younger generation. Policy responses aimed at boosting household incomes and expanding social safety nets are supporting this shift towards a domestically driven consumption economy. As consumption in China becomes more emotional and culturally driven, local brands are viewed as markers of identity, confidence, and aspiration.</p>

          <h2>Slightly Unusual 'Atmospheric River' to Hit Southeast U.S.</h2>

          <p>The Southeast United States is expected to experience an unusual "atmospheric river" event, bringing widespread rainfall and potential flooding. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain, with isolated spots seeing up to 12 inches, impacting Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. This event, originating from the Gulf of Mexico, is atypical for the region, with the closed-off low pressure routes back East. While the event could alleviate recent droughts in some areas, it also poses a risk of flooding in small creeks and low-lying areas.</p>
