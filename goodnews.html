          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul for yelling at officials during a recent game, and she has suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay the resulting fine. The incident occurred during a decisive win over the Las Vegas Aces, even while Clark was sidelined with an injury. The article notes this event as part of a more defiant team culture developing around the Fever, citing recent on-court altercations and post-game celebrations. This evolving team dynamic comes during Clark's second year in the WNBA and White's first as head coach.</p>

          <p>Artisans in Kolhapur, India, are accusing luxury fashion brand Prada of cultural appropriation over a new line of footwear that strongly resembles traditional, handcrafted Kolhapuri sandals. The controversy has sparked a backlash on social media, prompting Prada to acknowledge the sandals' origins. Local industry associations are now advocating for better recognition and protection for the craft, which has a history dating back to the 12th century. While the incident has highlighted the struggles of the artisans, some sellers note that the controversy has also unexpectedly boosted demand for the authentic designs.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play a Major Role in Carbon Sequestration, New Research Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine animals called zooplankton play a surprisingly large role in combating global warming through an annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously thought. This discovery highlights the critical but often overlooked importance of these organisms in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom. Zookeepers gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another couple to improve the survival chances for both chicks. This event is part of a successful breeding season for the zoo's colony of Humboldt penguins, a species listed as vulnerable to extinction. The zoo notes that same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins, and the male couple is sharing parenting duties, including feeding the chick regurgitated fish.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five types of "toxic" foods he avoids giving his own children to promote long-term health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs because of nitrates and sodium. He also warns against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which can contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team kept their T20 series against India alive with a dramatic five-run victory in a match at The Oval. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England's Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. The game featured a stunning momentum shift, as England recovered from a major batting collapse where they lost nine wickets for just 31 runs. Earlier, half-centuries from Sophia Dunkley and Danni Wyatt-Hodge had put England in a strong position before the late-inning drama unfolded, setting up a crucial fourth match in the series.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and civil war, arguing that today's political polarization is not unprecedented. Burns advocates for telling a complex, inclusive history that acknowledges the founders' flaws, such as slavery, alongside their brilliant ideas. He believes this fuller, more truthful narrative makes the founding story more powerful and accessible, providing a "lifeline" to navigate current challenges.</p>
