          <p>Former MLB MVP Josh Hamilton recounted on a podcast that he believed the Holy Spirit informed him he would hit a home run during Game 6 of the 2011 World Series. His subsequent two-run homer gave the Texas Rangers a temporary lead in a game they would ultimately lose. Hamilton also discussed his struggles with substance abuse, his path to finding his faith, and the context behind his 2019 charge for injury to a child, stating he pleaded to a lesser misdemeanor to protect his family from a public trial.</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an EV startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a minimalist and highly customizable electric pickup truck with a target price point significantly below the U.S. average. The company's strategy is to produce a barebones base model, allowing owners to add features and accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's price may rise from a projected sub-$20,000 to nearly $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment against established models.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that China, due to its extensive trade and defense relationships across the Middle East, is in a unique position to foster constructive solutions and prevent major conflicts in the region. The author suggests that as the world's second-largest power and a top trading partner for many nations, China can leverage its influence to mitigate humanitarian suffering. The piece contrasts this potential with the West, which it claims has either started or failed to prevent multiple simultaneous conflicts in the area.</p>

While maintaining his opposition to subsidizing green energy, the Transportation Secretary stated the administration would respect Congress's decision to authorize the funds. The new guidance for the program removes several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement and labor standards, which the administration claims will cut red tape and accelerate the rollout of charging infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described such an intervention as essential for national security. The analyst argued that despite free-market principles, direct government involvement is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. This move would align with President Trump's goal of increasing domestic production of high-end technology, potentially utilizing funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the investment.
