          <p>British boxer Hamzah Sheeraz made a powerful statement in his super middleweight debut by defeating Edgar Berlanga with a fifth-round knockout in Queens, New York. Sheeraz dominated the fight, dropping Berlanga twice in the fourth round before the referee stopped the contest early in the fifth. The victory positions the 26-year-old as a serious contender in the 168lb division, potentially setting up future bouts with top names like Canelo Álvarez. In the co-main event, Shakur Stevenson successfully defended his WBC lightweight title with a unanimous decision victory over William Zepeda in an entertaining, action-filled fight.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents, have received a significant legal victory in their long-running case. A Los Angeles judge has ruled that new evidence, including a letter alleging sexual abuse by their father and an affidavit from another individual claiming he was sexually assaulted by Jose Menendez, constitutes a prima facie showing for potential habeas relief. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office now has 30 days to argue why this relief should not be granted. This development comes as the brothers await a parole hearing in August after being resentenced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing data from existing upstream dams on the Brahmaputra River offers insights into the potential impact of China's planned mega-dam in Tibet. Contrary to fears in India that the project could cause droughts, the research suggests the opposite may be true for dry seasons. Data collected downstream from the Zangmu and Jiacha dams since 2014 indicates that low-flow water levels rose significantly, with a more than 50 percent increase observed in February. This suggests that dam operations may regulate water flow, increasing availability during drier periods and potentially alleviating water scarcity concerns for downstream nations like India.</p>
