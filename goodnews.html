          <p>Alaska's congressional delegation celebrated the Trump administration's move to rescind a Biden-era rule that restricted oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). They argued the rule was illegal and hindered responsible resource development, which is vital for the livelihood of local communities. Officials stated the reversal would enable Alaska to produce more energy, create jobs, and generate revenue for the government. The decision aligns with the Trump administration's focus on energy independence and domestic resource production.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported a substantial increase in U.S. sales for May, driven by an employee pricing program implemented amid rising tariff costs and vehicle price increases. Sales of vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines and hybrid models saw significant gains, offsetting a decline in all-electric vehicle sales. The employee pricing program, promoted as "From America, For America," resonated with customers and contributed to the strong sales results. The pricing promotion was introduced as President Trump's auto tariffs on imported vehicles took effect.</p>

The agreement will also expand Clinton's output by 30 megawatts and contribute to Meta's goal of achieving 100% clean electricity.

          <p>Experts predict potential shifts in home equity line of credit (HELOC) rates later in 2025, influenced by the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. HELOC rates generally move in tandem with federal funds rates, meaning any changes made by the Federal Reserve will likely impact HELOC rates. While a rate cut in June is considered unlikely, future rate adjustments will depend on various economic factors, particularly inflation. Homeowners considering a HELOC should monitor these trends and compare offers from different lenders to secure the most competitive rate. (not investment advice)</p>
