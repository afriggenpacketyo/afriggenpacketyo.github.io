          <p>The small mountain town of Marshall, North Carolina, is reopening to visitors nearly nine months after Hurricane Helene caused significant damage. Businesses along the French Broad River, which rose nearly 25 feet during the storm, are welcoming tourists again. Business owners recall the extensive mud damage and the support from volunteers across the country who helped with cleanup efforts. Despite the challenges, the community has shown resilience, and many businesses have reopened, with some even improving upon their previous state.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an order to implement parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, lower than the previously imposed 25% import tax. While the agreement includes aerospace products, it did not address the removal of charges on steel imports, which the UK government hopes to achieve. The UK government will continue to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as previously agreed, as the current US tax on UK imports of steel and aluminium is 25%.</p>

          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year contract worth ¬£500m to supply train tracks for Network Rail, potentially safeguarding the future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract ensures British Steel will continue to provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist products. This agreement comes after the government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners. The deal is expected to boost domestic manufacturing and supply chains, contributing to economic growth. </p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival is showcasing contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The festival includes performances such as the "Queer Passion," which highlights the suffering of LGBTQ individuals, and the "Arabian Passion," which promotes peace in the Middle East. These reinterpretations of Bach's work seek to connect classical music with current social and political issues. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive with the addition of the Kulukundis Collection, containing writings and autographs of Bach's sons.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stopped between stations. JR East reported that services were halted on the Tohoku shinkansen line between Tokyo and Sendai stations. The affected train, which debuted last year on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing delays for other trains. Operations are expected to resume later in the day following the completion of the inspection.</p>
