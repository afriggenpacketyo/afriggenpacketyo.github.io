          <p>A 90-year-old amateur golfer in the U.K. celebrated his milestone birthday by scoring his first-ever hole-in-one after playing for three decades. John Payne achieved the remarkable feat on a 200-yard par-three hole, an event he described as a "miracle" and a "once-in-a-lifetime shot." Despite deteriorating eyesight, he continues to play regularly and stay active with gym sessions, attributing his longevity and mobility to his active lifestyle. The achievement was celebrated by his family and the local golf club community.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, discovered he had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a fatal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring in his lungs. Initially given less than a year to live, he was initially resistant but ultimately underwent a successful double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. The procedure gave him a second chance at life, and he has since recovered significant lung capacity. Now, he is training a new therapy dog named "Encore" to celebrate his renewed life and perspective.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in October or November, although a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange the visit, which could occur before or after the APEC summit in South Korea. Recent high-level talks between the two nations' top diplomats were described as positive, suggesting a shared consensus on facilitating a leader-level summit. Hurdles remain, but discussions are ongoing to finalize the details for a potential meeting later this year.</p>

          <p>Irina Krynina, a Russian mother, moved to Ukraine with her daughters to be near her partner, a Russian soldier who was captured. Although her relationship ended, she remained in Ukraine and founded "Our Way Out," a project that helps relatives of Russian POWs connect with them and provides proof of their status. The initiative, which has a large online following, documents prisoners' stories and offers support, highlighting the human cost of the conflict. Krynina's work aims to show Russians the reality of the war, despite facing condemnation from her home country.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Justin Bieber's New Album 'Swag' Captures a Subdued Summer Mood</h2>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album, "Swag," and its hit single "Daisies" are being hailed as a potential "song of the summer" for their departure from typical upbeat pop. The album features a more subtle, R&B-influenced, and melancholic sound, which seems to resonate with the current cultural mood. This article suggests that the music's reserved and gentle quality fills a void in a landscape dominated by stale hits. The album's success reflects a broader trend towards downtempo, introspective music, possibly indicating a collective sense of malaise or a desire for soothing, complex sounds.</p>

          <p>Brazil is combating the devastating spread of dengue fever by releasing millions of specially bred mosquitoes. These "Wolbitos," developed by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, are infected with Wolbachia bacteria, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them, thereby halting transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói resulted in a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting a massive government investment to expand the initiative nationwide. This innovative biological approach offers a promising public health solution to a disease that has caused millions of infections in the country.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before any conversation can make you more influential and engaging. This brief mental rehearsal involves considering topics, questions, and goals, which helps you remain present and appear more considerate. The article explains that pre-planning is effective because the brain is too cognitively overwhelmed during a live conversation to brainstorm effectively. This simple strategy can improve communication skills, build stronger relationships, and advance one's career by fostering better connections with others.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams joked that she returned to competition for the health insurance benefits, a comment that resonated widely and highlighted the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the MLB trade deadline approaching, veteran closer Kenley Jansen of the Los Angeles Angels could be a trade target for his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers are in need of right-handed relief pitching, and Jansen is having a solid season, though he is a pending free agent on a struggling Angels team. While Jansen expressed a desire to help the Angels win, he acknowledged the business side of baseball and would be open to a non-closer role on a contending team. A trade would be a pragmatic move for the Angels to acquire pitching depth.</p>
