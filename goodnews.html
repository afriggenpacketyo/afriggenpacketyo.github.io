          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:42:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a significant sales surge, with August sales up over 53% year-over-year, marking a 21-year high for the model. This growth contrasts with the broader industry rush towards electric vehicles, indicating continued strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles, particularly large family SUVs. While Ford's EV sales also saw an increase, the success of the high-profit Expedition highlights a segment of the market that remains robust. The trend suggests some consumers are still willing to make large purchases on gasoline vehicles despite higher fuel costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are experiencing a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, identified as Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed ashore and into a local estuary by the high winds and rough surf from the recent Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without being washed back out to sea, it releases a strong, unpleasant odor. City officials have assured the public that while the stench is concerning, it is a natural process and is expected to dissipate gradually as the seaweed breaks down.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to host a dinner for approximately two dozen high-profile technology and business executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, Tim Cook, and Bill Gates. The event, held in the renovated Rose Garden, aims to foster the Trump administration's relationship with the Big Tech sector, which has been both close and complex. While many top leaders are expected to attend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has declined the invitation but will send a representative. The gathering highlights the administration's focus on emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and encouraging American reshoring efforts within the industry.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose sweeping tariffs on goods from over 60 countries. If the ruling is upheld by the Supreme Court, the U.S. government could be required to refund tens of billions of dollars collected from American businesses that paid these duties. The decision has created uncertainty for companies, as the refund process is not guaranteed to be simple or automatic. The administration could establish a system requiring businesses to apply for reimbursement, similar to past cases where taxes were deemed unlawful. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Regulator Suggests Tying University Tuition Fees to Teaching Quality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 14:16:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Office for Students (OfS), England's higher education regulator, has proposed that universities could be required to charge different tuition fees based on the quality of their teaching. This "differential fee levels" system could be implemented through the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), which ranks universities as gold, silver, bronze, or "requires improvement." While the government has the final say on fee structures, the suggestion introduces a potential mechanism to incentivize better teaching. The proposal comes as many universities face financial deficits and are seeking clarity on future funding and fee increases.</p>
