          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting has announced a national investigation into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex, aiming to provide families with the truth and accountability they deserve. The investigation is set to commence this summer and is expected to deliver its findings by December 2025.

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a bill that would have banned all THC consumables, preserving the state's billion-dollar market for THC-infused products. The bill aimed to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, but critics argued it would limit access for those who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical program. Retailers also pointed to the industry's significant contribution to jobs and revenue. This decision allows residents to continue legally accessing goods that provide a similar high to marijuana.</p>

The Securities Times argues that stablecoins offer unique advantages as an emerging payment tool, combining cryptocurrency efficiency with traditional money reliability. While unregulated stablecoins could harm China's financial system, forgoing this technology could hinder the yuan's internationalization.

These efforts include establishing a common standard for electronic prior authorization requests and reducing the types of claims subject to prior authorization.

          <p>There are indications that this year may be particularly active for ticks, as emergency care visits related to tick bites have increased since 2019. Ticks can transmit various disease-causing agents, making it crucial to take preventive measures, including frequent tick checks and using insect repellents. Risks vary by region, with Lyme disease being most common in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, while ehrlichiosis and spotted fever are more prevalent in the South. Prompt removal of ticks and awareness of local risks are essential for staying safe.</p>
