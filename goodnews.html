          <p>Members of Parliament in the UK are scheduled to vote on a bill to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales. Currently, abortion is technically illegal under the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861, but is permitted under certain conditions outlined in the 1967 Abortion Act. The proposed change comes amid concerns about an increase in police investigations of women suspected of illegally ending pregnancies. Two amendments are under consideration: one to decriminalize abortion entirely and another to make accessing an abortion a human right up to 24 weeks.</p>

          <p>The article compares debt forgiveness and debt consolidation as strategies for managing high credit card debt. Debt consolidation involves combining multiple debts into a single loan, ideally with a lower interest rate, while debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed. Debt forgiveness can significantly reduce the principal balance but often damages credit scores. The article provides a cost comparison, highlighting that while debt forgiveness may save more money upfront, the credit damage could lead to higher interest rates on future loans.

          <p>Boeing's gross orders for new airplanes reached 303 last month, the highest level since December 2023, as the company works to stabilize production and compete with Airbus. The manufacturer delivered 45 aircraft in May, an increase from the previous year. Boeing has logged orders for 512 planes this year, compared to 215 for Airbus. The Paris Air Show could lead to more orders, providing an opportunity for companies to showcase new technology and strike deals.</p>
