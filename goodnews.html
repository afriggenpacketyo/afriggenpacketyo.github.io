          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 21:56:22 EDT</div>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading on Wednesday as investors analyzed China's industrial profits, which saw a 1.5% year-on-year decline in July, marking the slowest contraction in five months. This notable recovery follows several months of steeper declines, suggesting some positive impact from Beijing's efforts against price wars. Concurrently, steep U.S. tariffs on Indian exports are set to increase to 50%, impacting India's trade relationships, though Indian markets were closed for a holiday. Regional indices like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi declined, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose. Overnight, Wall Street's major benchmarks closed higher, influenced by broader economic assessments and awaiting key corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully completed its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight, marking a significant comeback after three prior failures this year. The 40-story rocket performed as planned, with the Super Heavy booster splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico and the Starship upper stage deploying satellite simulators before an on-target splashdown in the Indian Ocean. Despite some re-entry heating damage, the vehicle remained controlled, offering crucial data for future missions. This success is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship to send astronauts to the Moon by 2027, though significant technical hurdles, including in-orbit refueling, still remain.</p>

          <p>Luxury parka maker Canada Goose is reportedly receiving take-private bids, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, as its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, explores an exit after a 12-year investment. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International, along with a consortium including Bosideng International, have made verbal offers. Bain's potential exit comes as Canada Goose struggles with slowing revenue growth in crucial markets like China and EMEA, and faces questions regarding its brand positioning and marketing strategy amidst cautious consumer spending on big-ticket apparel. Industry watchers suggest that taking the company private could offer greater autonomy to implement a turnaround strategy away from the scrutiny of regular financial disclosures, a necessary step given the brand's recent performance.

          <p>A collaborative team of researchers from the U.S. Department of Energy-funded Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Columbia University, Technical University of Munich, and East China Normal University has successfully converted difficult-to-degrade mixed plastic waste into premium petrol and chemical raw materials in a single step. This groundbreaking method operates efficiently at ambient temperature and pressure, marking a significant scientific first. The process yields main components of gasoline, chemical raw materials, and hydrochloric acid, which can be utilized in various industries including water treatment, metal processing, pharmaceuticals, food production, and the petroleum sector. This innovation supports a circular economy by transforming diverse plastic waste into valuable products, offering a promising solution for waste management and resource recovery.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their 53-man roster under Jim Harbaugh, with Trey Lance securing the backup quarterback position behind Justin Herbert, beating out veteran Taylor Heinicke. The team waived 25 players, including eight veterans and safety Tony Jefferson, while placing several on injured reserve, notably long snapper Josh Harris and linebacker Junior Colson for the season. The new-look offense will feature a running back duo of Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris, expected to carry a heavy workload in the team's run-oriented scheme. Significant changes also include a reshuffled offensive line due to injuries and a deep defensive line, as the team aims to improve its performance and shed the "postseason underachiever" label in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel announced it will revert to its classic logo, reinstating the beloved "Old Timer" illustration, after facing significant public backlash over a recent redesign. The company's decision, communicated via a statement, emphasized its commitment to "country hospitality that feels like family" and acknowledged customer voices, stating, "Our new logo is going away and our 'Old Timer' will remain." President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the reversal, applauded the move. The controversy also included criticism of newly remodeled restaurant locations, which aimed for a more modern aesthetic. Despite CEO Julie Masino's previous defense of the redesign, citing "overwhelmingly positive" feedback, the company ultimately chose to honor its traditional brand identity, demonstrating responsiveness to its customer base.</p>

          <p>An 85-year-old woman with dementia, Barbara Dee Crosby, who went missing from a senior living home in rural California, was safely located thanks to her loyal Chihuahua mix, Poncho. After a multi-agency search, reported sightings of Poncho led rescue crews to Crosby, who was found asleep down a 70-foot embankment, necessitating a rope system extraction due to the steep terrain. The faithful pup is hailed as an "unsung hero" for his crucial role in leading deputies to his missing owner. However, Poncho subsequently ran off "before he could be safely secured," and authorities are now seeking the public's help to locate him. The heartwarming story of his loyalty is now coupled with a renewed effort to bring the canine hero home.</p>
