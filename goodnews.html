          <p>Incumbent Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term in office after his Labour Party emerged as the leader in Norway's parliamentary elections. The left-wing coalition secured a narrow majority of 87 seats, allowing Stoere to continue governing despite facing challenges from a resurgent populist right. Key election issues included the rising cost of living, taxation policies, and the stability of public services, all set against a backdrop of international political uncertainty. The result signals a continuation of social democratic leadership in the country.</p>

The agreement involves his siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—relinquishing their shares and roles in the family trust, which will be restructured. This resolution ensures that the conservative-leaning direction of outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal will be maintained under Lachlan's leadership, aligning with the wishes of patriarch Rupert Murdoch.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's recent appearance in Beijing alongside other world leaders marks a significant diplomatic victory, transforming his image from an isolated pariah to an influential global player. The event, a military parade attended by the heads of China, Russia, and North Korea, showcased a new level of international engagement for Pyongyang. This contrasts sharply with the situation a decade ago when North Korea was diplomatically constrained by international sanctions.

          <p>State park staff on Angel Island in the San Francisco Bay recently filmed a coyote swimming across the deep Raccoon Strait, providing a rare glimpse into how the animals populate the island. A breeding coyote population was first established on the island in 2017, likely after the animals swam over a mile from the mainland. Researchers have been studying the phenomenon, noting that the island's coyote population, now estimated at 14 to 17 individuals, are all related. The sighting highlights the adaptability of coyotes as they expand their presence throughout the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, preventing its demolition. The ruling rejected a legal challenge from the property's current owners, who had planned to raze the 1920s Spanish-style hacienda to expand their adjacent estate. The home, which Monroe purchased in 1962 and where she died months later, has been the subject of a preservation battle between the owners and Monroe's fans and historians. This decision marks the second time the iconic property has been saved from destruction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, opening a high-yield savings account may still be a worthwhile financial decision for many savers. While returns are no longer at their recent peaks, rates on these accounts remain significantly higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Experts suggest that rate cuts will likely be gradual, meaning savers can still benefit from higher earnings in the interim. Furthermore, these accounts provide continued access to funds, offering flexibility in an unpredictable economic climate, unlike more restrictive options like CDs. (not investment advice)</p>
