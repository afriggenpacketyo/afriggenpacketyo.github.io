          <p>Rory McIlroy's long-stated goal of winning an away Ryder Cup was achieved at Bethpage Black, even as he lost his final day singles match to Scottie Scheffler. The article details the immense physical and emotional toll of the event on McIlroy, who faced a hostile crowd throughout the competition. Despite his individual loss on Sunday, his overall performance during the week was crucial to Europe's success. The match itself was uncharacteristically error-prone for both top-ranked players, reflecting the exhaustion and pressure of the three-day tournament.</p>

          <p>Shaun Murphy has won the British Open snooker title for the first time, defeating Anthony McGill 10-7 in a competitive final. The 2005 world champion produced eight breaks of 50 or more but was consistently challenged by McGill, who was playing in his first ranking final in eight years. After trading the lead multiple times, Murphy took control late in the match, winning the final four frames consecutively to secure his first ranking title in over two years.

          <p>In what was his final regular-season start, future Hall of Fame pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered 5 ⅓ scoreless innings to help the Los Angeles Dodgers secure a 6-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners. The performance lowered his career ERA to 2.53, the best among modern-era starters with over 1,000 innings pitched. Manager Dave Roberts confirmed Kershaw will not be on the roster for the upcoming wild-card series against the Cincinnati Reds. For the 37-year-old veteran to pitch again, the Dodgers must advance to the National League Division Series.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new Labour policy aimed at eliminating long-term youth unemployment by offering guaranteed paid work placements to young people out of work for 18 months. Under the proposal, individuals who refuse the placement without a reasonable excuse could face benefit sanctions. The initiative builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and aims to help young people develop skills for full-time employment. The plan comes as the number of 16-24 year-olds not in education, employment, or training has reached an 11-year high.</p>

          <p>In a recent analysis, Jim Cramer contends that the substantial spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure does not mirror the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. He argues that today's investments are being made by financially sound mega-cap companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Google, which can afford the capital projects, unlike the debt-leveraged startups of the dot-com era. The article posits that while the full potential of AI is still developing, the current buildout is a necessary strategic move for these tech giants to maintain their market dominance rather than a speculative frenzy.

          <p>The 2026 review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) presents significant economic stakes for Asian nations, which have seen trade and investment in North America grow substantially. In the last five years, Asian exports to the three USMCA countries increased by nearly 35%, while foreign direct investment from Asia into Mexico has more than tripled. This investment surge is driven by companies seeking to leverage USMCA tariff preferences and gain access to the North American market. The opinion piece argues that Asian economies should proactively engage in the public consultation process to protect their interests.</p>

          <p>The new independent drama "Plainclothes" explores the complex life of a closeted gay police officer in 1997 Syracuse, New York. The film follows Lucas, an undercover cop tasked with entrapping gay men, who develops a connection with one of his targets, Andrew. Directed by Carmen Emmi, the movie uses a non-linear structure to build suspense around both the officer's secret relationship and its potential exposure. The review praises the film's tense atmosphere and strong performances, particularly from Tom Blyth as Lucas and Russell Tovey as Andrew, for effectively conveying the emotional turmoil of a double life.</p>
