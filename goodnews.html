          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 20:13:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge them to support the budget package, which includes his legislative priorities, as it faces hurdles due to internal party divisions. Some conservatives are pushing for steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose alterations to the state and local tax deduction. Trump emphasized the need for unity and warned against undermining the bill, stating that any Republican who doesn't back what he refers to as the 'big, beautiful bill' would be 'knocked out so fast.' House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tight margin, needing nearly full Republican support to pass the bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 20:05:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has approved a waiver for Nebraska to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks using Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, marking a shift in federal nutrition policy. This decision reverses two decades of rejections of similar state efforts and is expected to pave the way for more states to implement such restrictions. Nebraska will begin the program in January 2026, affecting approximately 150,000 food stamp recipients, with plans to evaluate changes in spending habits and provide assistance to retailers during the transition. The move has garnered support from some health and conservative groups but faces opposition from trade groups and anti-poverty organizations.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed to a 90-day tariff truce following negotiations in Geneva, bringing a sense of relief to the global economy and boosting confidence in financial markets. While the remaining tariffs still impact bilateral trade, the agreement signals that neither side is prepared to sever economic ties completely. Many expect tariffs on Chinese goods to either hold steady or decrease further once the 90-day period lapses. The truce offers hope for resolution on fentanyl and other issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, yet its shares fell in extended trading, likely because the company did not raise its full-year outlook for key metrics. CEO Nikesh Arora highlighted the company's platformization strategy, emphasizing the adoption of its next-generation security suite, including AI-powered Cortex XSIAM and Prisma SASE. Despite solid results amid trade war discussions and macroeconomic uncertainty, the company's remaining performance obligation (RPO) and next-gen security ARR outlooks remained unchanged. The company delivered 90 net new platform clients in the quarter, bringing the total platformization count to 1,250 within its top 5,000 customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, estimating the project would cost $175 billion and be operational within three years. The project, led by Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein, aims to protect against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, including those launched from space. Experts have noted the technical challenges and high costs associated with defending the United States against such attacks, with some estimating the project could cost as much as $542 billion. The plan echoes former President Ronald Reagan's "Star Wars" initiative, though Trump expressed confidence that advancements in technology would allow for its successful implementation.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed Tuesday's market action, noting that rising bond yields drove stock movements as Wall Street awaits congressional action on a federal budget bill. He pointed out that stocks related to 'fickle consumers' and banks are particularly sensitive to bond yields. However, he highlighted GE Vernova as a company that can withstand changes in the bond market due to secular trends such as the growing need for energy from data centers. Cramer emphasized that GE Vernova has multiple factors working in its favor, allowing it to buck the bond voters. (not investment advice)</p>
