          <p>Apple has raised the monthly price of its Apple TV+ streaming service to $12.99 in the U.S. and other markets, marking the third price increase in three years. The new price is effective immediately for new subscribers and will apply to existing ones on their next renewal date after 30 days. This move follows similar price hikes by other major streaming platforms like Netflix and Peacock, as companies seek to fund new content and improve profitability. The annual subscription price for Apple TV+ will remain unchanged.</p>

          <p>While certificate of deposit (CD) yields have slightly decreased from their 2023 peaks, they remain historically high, offering a stable investment option in the current inflationary environment. This article outlines the potential interest earnings on a $25,000 deposit across various CD terms, from three months to five years. For example, a one-year CD at 4.30% could earn approximately $1,075, while a five-year CD at 4.20% could generate about $5,250. CDs provide fixed rates, protecting savers from market volatility and offering predictable returns. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to June, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This increase coincided with housing inventory reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price pressures. The median home price hit a record high for July at $422,400, a slight 0.2% increase from the previous year. The data suggests a potential market inflection point, as rising inventory provides more options for buyers and slows the pace of price growth. (not investment advice)</p>

In 2008, he responded to a fatal car crash where he discovered his own 15-year-old son, Ryan, was one of the victims. His advocacy comes as national data shows one in three public school officials feel that traffic poses a threat to students. Didone travels the country warning about distracted driving and speeding, urging communities to implement safety measures like speed cameras to protect children.</p>

          <p>This photo essay delves into the complex and varied emotional landscape of "empty nesters"—parents whose children have left home. Through intimate portraits and interviews with 14 individuals and couples in Los Angeles, the project reveals that this life stage is not a singular experience of loss. Instead, it is a period of profound transition marked by a mixture of grief, relief, loneliness, and newfound freedom. The stories illustrate how parents are rediscovering their identities, navigating new relationship dynamics, and reimagining their lives and homes in this mutable phase.</p>

          <h2>The Concept of "Moral Offsetting" for Meat Consumption Gains Traction Through Charity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent fundraiser for FarmKind, an organization supporting anti-factory farming charities, has popularized the idea of "moral offsetting" for meat-eaters. The concept, likened to carbon offsets, suggests that individuals who feel guilty about eating meat but are unwilling to go vegan can donate money to effectively reduce animal suffering elsewhere in the food system. While this pragmatic approach has raised millions and offers a new way for people to engage, it also sparks an ethical debate about whether it absolves personal responsibility and adequately addresses the core issues of factory farming.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the teachings of the Baha’i faith to extract five practical lessons for achieving a happier life, applicable to people of any belief system. Originating in 19th-century Persia, the faith emphasizes principles such as having faith in the future, embracing discomfort as a catalyst for growth, and seeking deeper spiritual happiness over fleeting pleasure. It also stresses the importance of serving others as a path to one's own well-being. The author presents these tenets as a time-tested strategy that combines behavioral science and philosophy for personal improvement.</p>

          <p>Five years after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the continent's reliance on imported vaccines, Africa is making tentative progress towards manufacturing its own. Spurred by a renewed political commitment, countries like South Africa, Senegal, Kenya, and Rwanda are expanding or establishing pharmaceutical production facilities. Initiatives like the African Vaccine Manufacturing Accelerator (AVMA) aim to help local producers become competitive by 2040. However, significant hurdles remain, including a lack of infrastructure and funding, and the continent is still heavily dependent on imports for its medical supplies.</p>

          <p>Judge Frank Caprio, who became an international figure for his empathetic and kind-hearted approach in Providence's Municipal Court, has died at the age of 88 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. His televised courtroom show, "Caught in Providence," went viral for showcasing his tendency to consider the personal circumstances of those before him, often with humor and compassion. A Providence native who served as a judge from 1985 to 2023, Caprio attributed his empathy to his own upbringing in poverty.

          <p>Ethel Caterham, a British woman officially recognized as the world's oldest living person, celebrated her 116th birthday on Thursday. Living in a care home in Surrey, she is the last living subject of King Edward VII, having been born in 1909. Caterham inherited the title of world's oldest person earlier this year after the passing of a 116-year-old Brazilian nun. Her family notes she has taken life's highs and lows in stride, even surviving a bout of COVID-19 at age 110, and attributes her longevity to "never arguing with anyone."</p>

The complex relocation is part of a massive, multi-year project to move the entire town center. This extraordinary measure was necessary because the ground beneath the original town site has become unstable due to the expansion of a large, nearby iron-ore mine, which is crucial to the local economy. The preservation and careful moving of the historic structure marks a significant milestone in the town's ambitious relocation effort.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have detailed their new trade agreement, confirming that the U.S. will not impose previously threatened high tariffs on EU pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. Instead, these goods will face a 15% tariff, in line with most other sectors. The deal also stipulates that the U.S. will lower its 27.5% tariff on European cars to 15%, but only after the EU passes legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods. Wine and spirits were not exempted from tariffs, disappointing industry groups. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Study Questions the Effectiveness of Wolf Hunting in Protecting Livestock</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study analyzing data from four Western U.S. states suggests that public wolf hunting has a negligible impact on reducing livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers found that killing one wolf saved only about 7% of a single cow, meaning roughly 14 wolves would need to be hunted to prevent one cow's death. The findings challenge a key justification for regulated wolf hunts in states like Montana and Idaho. The study's authors suggest that if the primary goal is to reduce livestock predation, hunting may not be the most effective management tool.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has reportedly won the race to sign England international and Crystal Palace forward Eberechi Eze, making a late bid after rivals Tottenham Hotspur had already agreed to terms. The move was allegedly prompted by a potential knee injury to Arsenal's Kai Havertz, leading the club to act on its long-standing interest. Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who was in their academy, reportedly favored the move to the Emirates Stadium. The transfer is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, strengthening their attack with a creative player capable of breaking down defenses.</p>
