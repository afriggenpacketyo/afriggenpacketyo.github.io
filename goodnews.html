          <p>This article provides a breakdown of estimated monthly annuity payouts based on different investment amounts and the age at which payments start. The payouts vary depending on whether the individual is male or female, due to differing life expectancies, with men generally receiving higher monthly payouts. It explains that the older you are when you purchase an annuity, the larger the monthly payments will be, because the insurer anticipates making payments for a shorter period. The article also discusses when an annuity might be a worthwhile investment, particularly for those seeking guaranteed income and peace of mind in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has accepted an invitation to the G7 summit in Canada, signaling a potential thaw in relations after a period of diplomatic tension. The tension was triggered by Canadian allegations that Indian agents were involved in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and pro-Khalistan activist, in June 2023. Modi expressed his desire to rebuild ties with Ottawa, emphasizing the shared values of democracy and mutual respect between India and Canada. The article notes that there have been signs of improvement in diplomatic relations recently, with foreign ministers from both countries seeking to mend the strained relationship.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Northwestern University suggests that Duavee, a medication commonly used to treat menopause symptoms, may also help prevent breast cancer. The study found that the drug significantly reduced breast tissue cell growth in post-menopausal women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Participants taking Duavee also reported fewer hot flashes during the study, and researchers emphasized that the medication is not a treatment for invasive breast cancer or DCIS. While the findings are preliminary, researchers are encouraged by the potential of the drug to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in women at higher risk.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price has begun to regain ground after experiencing a significant drop following a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock was up more than 5% in morning trading after closing down 14% the previous day due to Trump's threats to remove government contracts from Musk's companies. Analysts believe the tension between Musk and Trump unnerved investors, but remain optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly in the autonomous vehicle sector. Musk's net worth reportedly plunged $34 billion due to the fall in Tesla shares.</p>

          <p>The Swiss government has proposed new capital rules that would require UBS to hold an additional $26 billion in core capital, following its acquisition of Credit Suisse in 2023. The measures also entail UBS fully capitalizing its foreign units and potentially reducing share buybacks.

          <p>Used vehicle prices decreased slightly in May from April's high, driven by consumer fears of tariff-related price increases, according to Cox Automotive's Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. Despite the decrease, prices remain 4% higher than the previous year. While President Trump's tariffs on new imported vehicles do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices and demand affect the used car market. Demand for used vehicles remains strong due to low inventory levels, driven by consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years.</p>
