          <h2>Trump Proposes Using Tariff Revenue for Citizen Rebate Checks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:25:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering a proposal to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by new tariff revenues. The idea is being explored as a way to return money to taxpayers, possibly targeting certain income levels, while also aiming to pay down the national debt. The article provides context on the significant tariff revenue collected and notes that such a plan would require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue the payments. It also mentions previous rebate checks issued during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether homeowners can close on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in under two weeks. While the typical process takes two to six weeks due to necessary verification steps like appraisals and underwriting, faster closings are possible. The article advises that success depends on the lender's efficiency, the borrower's preparedness with documentation, and the possibility of an appraisal waiver. It provides actionable tips for homeowners looking to speed up the process, such as getting prequalified and choosing a lender known for quick turnarounds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new series on the Britbox streaming service, titled "Outrageous," explores the dramatic and often controversial lives of the six famous Mitford sisters. These British aristocrats became notable figures in the 20th century for their divergent political affiliations, which ranged from communism to fascism, and their high-profile social lives. The article references a 1989 NPR interview with Jessica Mitford, one of the sisters, where she discussed her communist beliefs and her well-known book about the funeral industry. The new show aims to bring their complex family dynamics and historical impact to a modern audience.</p>

          <p>This article investigates why in-flight Wi-Fi service remains unreliable despite two decades of availability and promises of improvement. The core issue is not the Wi-Fi itself but the back-end connection to the internet, which relies on either slower air-to-ground technology or better but not universally adopted satellite systems. Airlines are slowly upgrading their fleets, prioritizing larger jets on long-haul routes, leaving many regional and short-haul planes with subpar service. While airlines now see reliable internet as a competitive necessity rather than a luxury, a full, consistent rollout is still projected to be years away.</p>

His performance was the cornerstone of England's commanding position in the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford. England finished the third day at 544-7, holding a substantial lead of 186 runs. Root's partnership with Ben Stokes, who also scored a half-century before retiring hurt with cramp, has put England in a strong position to win the match and secure a 3-1 series lead.</p>

          <p>NPR's advice column tackles two personal dilemmas: how to handle a friend who constantly makes negative comments about her own body and how to deal with a brother-in-law's cruel teasing. For the first issue, experts suggest either distancing from the friendship or attempting to guide the friend toward a more positive mindset together. For the second, which involves a brother-in-law making jokes about eating disorders in front of children, the advice is to confront the bully directly and set firm boundaries, prioritizing the well-being of oneself and one's children over maintaining family peace at all costs.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file workers. The legislation would offer a 3-percentage-point corporate tax rate discount to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their employees. Proponents argue the bill could transfer nearly $4 trillion in stock value to millions of middle-class Americans, expanding ownership and potentially increasing employee loyalty. The goal is to allow more workers to share in the financial success of the companies they help build. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a consumer warning about the potential pitfalls of 0% APR balance transfer credit cards. While these cards can be a useful tool for paying down high-interest debt, failing to clear the balance before the promotional period ends can have costly consequences. The regular, often high, interest rate will apply to the remaining balance, and some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the transfer date. To avoid these outcomes, the article advises creating a strict payoff plan, avoiding new purchases on the card, and considering other debt relief options if the balance is unmanageable.</p>

          <p>This literary travel article explores the subtle but significant role the Greek island of Corfu played in the creation of John le Carré's masterpiece, *A Perfect Spy*. While the novel itself features few scenes set on the island, a real-life encounter le Carré had there with a former associate of his con-artist father provided a key thematic element for the book's protagonist. The piece reflects on how a location can serve as a catalyst for a writer, influencing themes of identity, betrayal, and the lingering impact of the past. It connects the island's own history of invasions and influences to the novel's central concerns.</p>
