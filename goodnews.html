          <p>Florida biologists have removed a record 20 tons of invasive Burmese pythons from the Everglades, marking a milestone in the state's 25-year effort to control the species. The Conservancy of Southwest Florida's team has shattered previous records for a single-season haul, showcasing progress in reversing the snakes' takeover, though complete eradication is unlikely. Experts emphasize that each python removed is beneficial, leading to demographic shifts and fewer large pythons in certain areas. The conservancy focuses on tracking and removing females during breeding season using tagged male "scout" snakes, preventing an estimated 20,000 eggs from hatching since 2013.</p>

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, implemented in January, has shown early success in reducing traffic and raising funds for public transit, but faces opposition from the Trump administration. The policy charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, and has resulted in fewer vehicles in the congestion zone and faster bus routes. However, the Trump administration is seeking to revoke federal approval for the program, leading to a legal battle and uncertainty about its future. If the program is terminated, it would create a significant budget gap for the MTA and raise questions about states' rights.</p>

US universities should cultivate new pipelines of students, especially from under-explored countries on the African continent, in order to strengthen their resilience. US universities should start forging partnerships around certification and pricing with African universities to enable different models of dual- and joint-degree programs. This can be low-hanging fruit, not least because the American degree is still much sought after.</p>
