        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid reports of a potential deployment of federal agents to the city. The order seeks to prohibit federal agents from wearing masks and mandates they display clear identification, such as badges with their name and agency. This preemptive measure also directs city departments to assist residents in understanding their rights and bars municipal police from collaborating with federal enforcement actions that could violate civil liberties. The move has drawn criticism from the White House, which characterized it as a political stunt distracting from crime.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Lexie Hull is sporting two black eyes following a head-on collision with Seattle Storm forward Gabby Williams during a recent WNBA game. Both players fell to the floor but were able to walk off and eventually return to the game after being checked by trainers. Fever coach Stephanie White praised Hull's resilience, stating the injury epitomizes her toughness and all-out playing style. Hull confirmed she was thoroughly evaluated for any serious injuries like a facial fracture and felt relieved that the outcome wasn't worse, appreciating the concern from fans online.</p>

          <p>Davina Perrin, an 18-year-old batter for the Northern Superchargers, scored a spectacular 101 runs from just 43 balls in The Hundred eliminator match, leading her team to the final. Her 42-ball century is the fastest by an English woman in T20-format cricket and makes her the first black British woman to achieve a professional T20 century. Perrin, a product of the ACE programme aimed at increasing black representation in cricket, has been praised for her powerful and precise 360-degree playing style. Her performance is seen as a major breakthrough, signaling a bright future and potential for an England national team call-up.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consolidated advice on appropriate screen time for children, emphasizing that limits should adapt to developmental stages. For toddlers, the consensus is "screen-free until age three," as this period is crucial for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For kindergarten-aged children, a maximum of 30 minutes is recommended to encourage imagination and social interaction. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to content and context, with experts urging parents to engage with their children about their digital activities to mitigate risks like online grooming and ensure technology is used constructively.</p>

His man-of-the-match display in a 3-2 win at Wolves has intensified discussions about his exclusion from the latest England squad under manager Thomas Tuchel. Everton boss David Moyes praised Grealish's immediate impact, noting he is playing with a renewed sense of purpose and proving his quality after a season with limited starts at City. Grealish's form is making a strong case for his return to the national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>After two tense opening matches, American tennis star Coco Gauff delivered a commanding performance to defeat Magdalena Frech 6-3, 6-1, advancing to the fourth round of the US Open. Gauff, who recently changed her coaching team to address serving issues, showed improved composure and confidence, striking just four double faults in the match. Her victory sets up a highly anticipated fourth-round match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka. This will be their sixth meeting and their first at the tournament since Osaka's win in 2019, when Gauff was a 15-year-old wildcard.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen publicly for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death trended on social media. He was photographed at the White House preparing to leave for a family golf trip in Virginia with his grandchildren. The online speculation was fueled by recent comments from J.D. Vance, who spoke about being prepared to assume presidential duties in the event of a tragedy. This appearance, along with recent clarifications about minor health issues like bruising on his hand, serves to counter the viral misinformation regarding his well-being.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, leading to 90 hospitalizations and seven deaths. An investigation traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to enhance the city's detection and prevention measures, including more frequent testing of cooling towers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed an AI-enhanced stethoscope that can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds undetectable by the human ear, sending the data to an AI trained on thousands of patients. A large-scale study in London GP surgeries found that patients examined with the device were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions within a year. The British Heart Foundation has called the innovation a potential "game-changer" for treating patients sooner, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>
