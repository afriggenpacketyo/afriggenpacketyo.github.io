          <p>Tennis legend Serena Williams, through her firm Serena Ventures, has invested in the women's 3-on-3 basketball league, Unrivaled. The investment is part of a new funding round that values the two-year-old league at $340 million and also includes notable figures like soccer star Alex Morgan and tennis pioneer Billie Jean King. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason, claiming to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports. Williams' investment underscores a growing financial interest in women's sports.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates remaining relatively high, savers with significant funds like $40,000 face a choice between Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. While both currently offer similar returns, a key difference is that CD rates are fixed for the term, protecting against future rate drops, whereas savings account rates are variable. However, CDs require locking money away for a set period, with penalties for early withdrawal, making high-yield savings a better option for those needing liquidity. The article advises savers to consider their long-term financial stability and access needs before committing funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his intention to utilize long throw-ins as a key attacking strategy for the upcoming World Cup, signaling a tactical shift. This tactic, famously employed by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League, with data showing a significant increase in their use and effectiveness. Throw-in specialists, like Thomas Gronnemark who previously worked with Liverpool, have demonstrated how optimizing this aspect of the game can lead to improved possession and goal-scoring opportunities. The move suggests England is exploring all possible avenues to gain a competitive edge.</p>

          <p>California is set to experience a significant cooldown this week due to an "early season cold front" moving in from the Pacific Northwest. After enduring weeks of extreme heat and wildfires, temperatures across the state are expected to drop 10 to 20 degrees below average. The Bay Area and Northern California may receive light rain and thunderstorms, which could help dampen wildfire risks in the region. While Southern California is not expected to get significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may bring some drizzle, providing a temporary respite from high fire danger.</p>

          <p>Aerosmith's Steven Tyler made a televised return to the stage at the 2025 MTV VMAs to honor the late heavy metal icon Ozzy Osbourne. Tyler, alongside bandmate Joe Perry and other musicians like Yungblud, performed a medley of Osbourne's hits including "Crazy Train" and "Mama, I’m Coming Home." The performance was a notable appearance for Tyler, as Aerosmith had previously announced its retirement from touring in 2024 due to a vocal cord injury he sustained. The emotional tribute was a highlight of the awards show, which also saw Lady Gaga win artist of the year.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates falling to an 11-month low, many homeowners who bought during recent peaks are considering refinancing. The article advises evaluating several key questions before proceeding, such as whether current rates are low enough to justify the action, typically a one-percentage-point drop. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the potential for rates to rise unexpectedly. It is also crucial to calculate the closing costs, which can range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and ensure the homeowner plans to stay in the home long enough to recoup those costs.

          <p>For individuals struggling with significant credit card debt amid high interest rates, generic advice is often insufficient. This article outlines three ways to get personalized help, starting with consulting a non-profit credit counseling agency. These professionals can create a comprehensive debt management plan, potentially negotiating lower interest rates with creditors on your behalf. Another option is working with a for-profit debt relief company, which can negotiate to reduce the total amount owed. Finally, the article suggests proactively contacting credit card issuers directly to inquire about hardship programs or temporary payment plans.</p>
