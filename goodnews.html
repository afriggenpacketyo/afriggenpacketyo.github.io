          <p>Across the United States, people gathered to remember George Floyd on the fifth anniversary of his death, marking the event with services and commemorations in Houston and Minneapolis. Floyd's death in 2020, caused by a police officer kneeling on his neck, ignited global protests against racism and police brutality. Reverend Al Sharpton led a service in Houston, Floyd's hometown, advocating for continued police reform. While some view Floyd's death as a catalyst for national reckoning, concerns remain about the rollback of police reforms, underscoring the ongoing struggle for racial justice.</p>

          <p>The Argentine comic 'El Eternauta,' a dystopian drama about a group of friends battling a deadly snowfall, has gained international recognition with its Netflix adaptation. The series, which premiered on April 30, reached number one among Netflix's most-watched series, prompting renewal for a second season. Written by H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld in 1957, the comic resonates deeply in Argentina, where Oesterheld and his daughters were 'disappeared' during the military dictatorship. The renewed interest has publishers scrambling to reprint translated editions, reflecting anxieties about the current state of Argentine society under President Javier Milei.</p>

          <p>A Republican senator has stated that there is enough resistance to President Trump's "One Big, Beautiful Bill" to halt its progress in the Senate unless significant changes are made. Senator Ron Johnson expressed concerns that the bill increases the deficit and urged for deeper spending cuts. Another issue with the bill is that it raises the debt ceiling, which some GOP senators said they wanted to deal with separately. Speaker Johnson defended the bill, emphasizing the need to expedite its passage and expressing hope that the president could sign it by Independence Day.</p>
