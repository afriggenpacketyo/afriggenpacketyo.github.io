          <h2>New England Seafood Industry Turns to Eating Invasive Green Crabs to Control Population</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New England seafood industry is adopting a strategy of consuming invasive green crabs in an effort to manage their population. These crabs, which arrived from Europe and West Africa in the 1980s, are harming shellfish populations, including soft-shell clams, due to their omnivorous diet. Fishermen in Massachusetts are being paid to eradicate the crabs, but finding a market for them is challenging due to their limited edibility. Sharon St. Ours & Company has developed a crab broth powder from green crabs, which was recognized at the Seafood Expo North America trade show, offering a potential culinary solution to the ecological problem.</p>

          <h2>RSV Hospitalizations Among Infants Drop Significantly Due to New Preventative Measures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CDC study indicates a substantial decrease in RSV-related hospitalizations among infants, attributed to the widespread availability of a maternal vaccine and a monoclonal antibody treatment. Hospitalization rates for babies under seven months old fell by up to 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a decrease of up to 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach noted fewer critically ill children from RSV this year, highlighting the effectiveness of the new preventatives. The study suggests that increased utilization of these measures could further reduce RSV hospitalizations in infants, marking a significant breakthrough in pediatric care.</p>

          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is advocating for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports, aiming to reduce border queues. Ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, Thomas-Symonds expressed optimism about securing agreements on trade, security, and youth mobility. Conservative MP Alex Burghart raised concerns about the UK becoming a 'rule taker' by aligning with EU standards, while Reform UK leader Nigel Farage criticized the proposed youth mobility scheme as a betrayal of Brexit. The negotiations focus on jobs, lower household bills, and stronger borders, with potential benefits for British travelers and businesses.</p>

          <p>Two volumes of 2,300-year-old silk books, considered the earliest known in China, have been repatriated to Beijing from the National Museum of Asian Art in the United States. These Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to around 300BC, are more than a century older than the Dead Sea Scrolls. The manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and transferred out of China in 1946. The return of the volumes follows diplomatic efforts by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China, highlighting the museum's new ethical returns policy.</p>

          <p>Seventy-five years ago, Desi Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, challenged Hollywood's prejudice by insisting on playing Lucille Ball's husband in "I Love Lucy," breaking new ground in television and becoming a beloved figure.

His technical innovations, such as filming the show in front of a live audience, led to the birth of the rerun and syndication markets.
