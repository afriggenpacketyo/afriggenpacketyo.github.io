          <p>Northampton Saints delivered a stunning 37-34 victory over Leinster in the Investec Champions Cup semi-final at Aviva Stadium, fueled by a desire for revenge after last year's defeat. Alex Mitchell emphasized the team's fearless approach, punching Leinster in the face during the first 20 minutes, which the Irish province wasn't expecting. Tommy Freeman scored a hat-trick, and Henry Pollock added a searing try, while Leinster responded after half-time but lacked the clinical edge to regain the lead. Phil Dowson, Saints' director of rugby, highlighted the belief within the group despite being written off by many, emphasizing the significance of their defensive effort at the end.</p>

The measure comes in response to strict new requirements placed on condominium associations after the 2021 Surfside collapse, which have led to steep special assessments for condo owners.</p>
