Studies show that elderspeak, often arising from ageist assumptions, can lead to resistance to care and lower use of antipsychotic drugs. The program involves videos and discussions to reduce elderspeak in nursing homes. While well-intended, elderspeak can alienate older adults and make them feel less like individuals.
