        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of individuals, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are moving away from dating apps and embracing in-person singles events to find partners. Companies like Date Cincy are capitalizing on this trend, which is driven by a desire for genuine, face-to-face connections and frustration with the misrepresentation common on digital platforms. This shift is reflected in the declining market value of apps like Bumble and a significant rise in attendance at singles events, suggesting a cultural move back toward more traditional forms of meeting people.</p>

          <p>Tonia Haddix, an exotic animal broker featured in the HBO docuseries “Chimp Crazy,” has been sentenced to 46 months in prison for perjury and obstruction of justice. Haddix had falsely claimed in court that her celebrity chimpanzee, Tonka, had died, when in fact she was hiding him in a small cage in her basement. PETA, which had pursued legal action against Haddix, discovered Tonka's whereabouts with help from the docuseries' director. The chimp has since been relocated to a sanctuary in Florida, and the case highlights ongoing issues in the exotic animal trade.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation to create geographical restriction zones for serious violent and sexual offenders upon their release from prison. Unlike current exclusion zones that bar offenders from specific areas, this new system would confine them to a designated zone, monitored by enhanced electronic tagging. The Ministry of Justice states this will provide victims greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel without fear of encountering their attacker. However, probation officers have raised concerns that the new policy will add significant pressure to an already strained service.</p>

          <p>Travel firms in the United Kingdom report a growing trend of Britons booking shorter holidays, closer to home, and often at the last minute. Companies like Booking.com and Pitchup.com have seen a significant increase in spontaneous domestic trip planning, a shift attributed to both cost-of-living pressures and a desire to take advantage of favorable weather. Holiday parks like Butlin's have experienced a surge in late bookings as families seek all-inclusive UK stays to better manage their budgets. This trend suggests a revival in camping and local travel as affordable alternatives to going abroad.</p>

          <p>A pop-up health clinic on the quayside in Brixham, Devon, is being highlighted as a successful model for the future of NHS care in England. The clinic brings GPs, pharmacists, and other specialists directly to fishermen, a community that often struggles to access traditional healthcare services due to their demanding work schedules. This approach aligns with a new 10-year NHS plan to shift focus from hospital treatment to preventative, community-based care, especially in underserved coastal and rural areas. The clinic has successfully identified and treated conditions that could have otherwise become severe, demonstrating the value of targeted, local health initiatives.</p>

          <p>According to research from brokerage firm CLSA, China's top semiconductor manufacturers, like SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are unlikely to be severely affected by President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips. The analysis suggests the direct impact will be small, and the companies might even benefit from potential countermeasures from China and other nations. This assessment is supported by customs data showing China has successfully diversified its chip exports to Southeast Asian countries, reducing its reliance on the U.S. market. The new tariffs exempt companies that manufacture or invest in U.S. facilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is considering buying shares of cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, which saw their stock prices fall in reaction to competitor Fortinet's disappointing earnings report. Fortinet's stock plunged after management indicated its firewall refresh cycle was further along than analysts expected, dragging down the entire sector. The club argues that cloud-native companies like CrowdStrike, which do not sell traditional firewalls, were unfairly punished and now represent an attractive buying opportunity due to market overreaction.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams was defeated in the first round of the Cincinnati Open by 22-year-old Spanish player Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, 6-4, 6-4. Despite showing flashes of her formidable skill and fighting back to level the first set, the 45-year-old Williams was ultimately outlasted by her younger, in-form opponent. Williams expressed satisfaction with her competitive performance, attributing the loss to needing more match play after a sparse competition schedule in recent years. She is expected to compete next in the US Open, where she will likely receive a main draw wildcard.</p>
