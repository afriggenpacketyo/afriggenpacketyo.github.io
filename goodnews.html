        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources familiar with an early intelligence assessment, the U.S. military strikes ordered by President Trump on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back the program by months, contradicting claims of complete obliteration. The report, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command, indicates that while significant damage was done to above-ground structures, enriched uranium and centrifuges largely remained intact. Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth have maintained that the program was "obliterated," but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused CNN of running a leaked story by a "low-level loser" to demean President Trump and discredit the fighter pilots who conducted the mission. As more information is gathered, the assessment may change. </p>

Citing a scheduling conflict, Beijing informed the Brazilian government that Premier Li Qiang will lead the Chinese delegation instead, similar to his role at the G20 summit in India in 2023. Officials noted that Xi has met with Brazilian President Lula da Silva twice in the past year, including at the G20 summit and during a state visit to Bras√≠lia last November, as well as at the China-Celac forum in Beijing in May. Xi previously missed a BRICS summit in 2023, sending Commerce Minister Wang Wentao in his place without an official explanation.</p>

          <p>China closely monitors the conflict between Israel and Iran due to its significant economic and political ties with both countries. As the largest importer of Iranian oil, China relies on Iran for approximately 90% of its crude oil, despite U.S. sanctions. This trade relationship has fostered a close partnership, with Iran offering visa-free entry to Chinese tourists and thousands of Chinese citizens residing in Iran. While China does not have a global military presence, it wields considerable political influence in Tehran, prompting calls for Beijing to mediate tensions in the region.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account, noting that the economic climate has shifted. It calculates that a $10,000 one-year CD at 4.45% would earn $445, while a $10,000 high-yield savings account at 4.30% would earn $430, assuming the rate remains constant. The article notes that CD interest rates are fixed, providing guaranteed earnings, whereas high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. The article concludes that, currently, CDs offer a more beneficial and secure option. (not investment advice)</p>
