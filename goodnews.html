          <p>Starbucks is renovating its US cafes to create more welcoming and inclusive spaces, aiming to restore its status as a "third place" for customers. The redesigns will feature cozier seating, warmer wood paneling, and less harsh lighting to accommodate individuals with light sensitivity. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to reverse a recent sales slump by making stores more comfortable for lingering, a departure from previous years where seating and outlets were removed to prioritize mobile orders. The company plans to spend approximately $150,000 on each "uplift" for about 1,000 locations by 2026.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could reach a value of $1 trillion over the next decade. The package involves awarding Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones in profitability, production, and market capitalization. To unlock the full award, Tesla's market value would need to grow to $8.5 trillion, about eight times its current valuation. This proposal follows a previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 that was voided by a Delaware judge earlier this year.</p>

          <p>A Michigan couple experienced an unexpected delivery when their baby girl was born in the parking lot of a McDonald's in Schoolcraft. Alyce and Kevin Rotunda were rushing to the hospital when they realized they would not make it in time, forcing them to pull over at the fast-food restaurant. The father, despite a typical aversion to medical situations, successfully delivered the baby, Matilda, who has since been affectionately nicknamed "McTilly." Both mother and baby are healthy, and the local McDonald's franchise celebrated the unique birth story on its social media page.</p>

The team is also set to debut Jens Castrop, a German-born midfielder who will be the first foreign-born player to represent South Korea after a one-time nation switch approved by FIFA. The friendly offers a chance for a fresh start under Coach Hong, who is under pressure to improve the team's performance.</p>

          <p>At a White House dinner, Google CEO Sundar Pichai thanked President Donald Trump for his administration's "constructive dialogue" following a favorable resolution in a major antitrust case. A federal judge recently ruled against breaking up the company, a decision that added $230 billion to Alphabet's market capitalization. The landmark lawsuit, which found Google held an illegal monopoly in internet search, was initiated by the Department of Justice during Trump's first term. During the dinner, Trump incorrectly claimed the Biden administration had prosecuted the lawsuit, a point Pichai did not correct.</p>

          <p>Chinese city governments are intensifying their efforts to lead in artificial intelligence, with Wenzhou becoming the first to establish a dedicated bureau for AI matters. This move signals a strategic priority to integrate AI into its growth plan, overseeing policies, coordinating computing resources, and promoting "AI+" projects across various industries. The initiative reflects a broader national push by Beijing to leverage local governments in its technological race against the U.S. Even second-tier cities are now scrambling to build digital infrastructure and invest in resources to support their AI ambitions and fuel national competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Germany's new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, has affirmed the government's commitment to its climate targets, including achieving climate neutrality by 2045. Despite his limited prior experience in environmental policy, Schneider insists that climate protection remains a top priority for the new administration. His stance comes amidst internal debate, as some conservative members of the coalition government have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the goals, advocating for economic revival and new gas-fired power plants. Schneider aims to work calmly behind the scenes to advance climate policy both domestically and internationally.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European countries has announced a finalized plan to ensure Ukraine's security after its war with Russia concludes, which includes the deployment of troops on the ground. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that 26 countries have committed to a "reassurance force" that would operate in Ukraine's land, sea, and air to prevent future aggression. The plan emphasizes that these troops would not be deployed on the front line but would serve as a security guarantee. The backbone of the strategy remains a strong, unrestricted Ukrainian army, ensuring the nation can defend itself effectively.</p>

          <p>A forecasting tournament designed to predict AI progress found that both domain experts and generalist "superforecasters" significantly underestimated the pace of advancements between 2022 and 2025. The study, conducted by the Forecasting Research Institute, tracked predictions on several AI benchmarks, such as an AI winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad, which occurred years ahead of schedule. While AI experts' predictions were slightly closer to reality than the superforecasters', both groups were systematically wrong. The results suggest that predicting the trajectory of AI is exceptionally difficult, even for the most informed observers.</p>

          <p>A French couple has been given suspended jail sentences and fines for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment. The case gained attention in 2019 when the young panther escaped onto the rooftops of a nearby building in Armentieres, prompting a police and rescue operation. The owners, who claimed they saw the animal as their "big, affectionate baby," had purchased her from a traveling community. The court barred the man from keeping animals for five years, ruling that keeping the wild animal was tantamount to species trafficking and mistreatment.</p>
