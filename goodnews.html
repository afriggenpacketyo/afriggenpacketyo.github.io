          <p>Former Tour de France winner and two-time Olympic gold medalist Geraint Thomas participated in his final professional cycling race, concluding his career with an emotional farewell in his hometown of Cardiff.

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring two key events in the upcoming week: the release of major inflation reports and Apple's annual hardware launch. Following a soft jobs report, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) data will be critical in shaping expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Meanwhile, Apple is expected to unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup, which could influence the tech sector and drive a new upgrade cycle for the company. These events will provide important insights into consumer spending, corporate pricing power, and the overall health of the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As part of a brand rebirth, Hooters plans to make its iconic orange shorts less revealing, shifting the uniform's image from risqué to "athletic." Neil Kiefer, CEO of the group seeking to reclaim the brand after its corporate operator filed for bankruptcy, stated the change aims to align with the original 1980s dolphin-short style. The move is intended to make the restaurant more comfortable and approachable for a broader customer base, including families and women. The company believes this adjustment will help ensure the brand's long-term sustainability by focusing on an athletic look rather than an overly sexualized one.</p>

Guo, who was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research, was accused of filing a false flight plan. As part of his release, he must pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chilean territory for three years.

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, was instructed to let him pass. A slow pit stop for Norris had initially dropped him behind Piastri, but the team intervened, citing tactical reasons and referencing a previous race where the roles were reversed. While Piastri complied with the order, the decision has sparked debate about fairness in racing when team strategy overrides on-track events like pit stop errors.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Black Ferns delivered a commanding performance to defeat Ireland 40-0, securing the top spot in Pool C of the Women's Rugby World Cup. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the decisive victory. The reigning world champions controlled the match from the start, effectively avenging their loss to Ireland in the WXV1 tournament last year. While both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, New Zealand's dominant win ensures them a theoretically easier path in the knockout stage of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Everton's new signing, 20-year-old Ornella Vignola, made a spectacular debut by scoring a hat-trick in a 4-1 victory over rivals Liverpool in the Women's Super League. Playing at Anfield, Vignola's performance was pivotal, as her first goal shifted the momentum after Liverpool had taken an early lead. The Uruguayan-born forward, who joined from Spanish club Granada, became the first Everton player to score three goals in a Merseyside derby since 1931. Her exceptional debut signals strong potential for both the player and Everton's ambitions for the season.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound as part of the second national test of the government's emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM, was designed to ensure the system's readiness for broadcasting urgent warnings during national emergencies like severe weather or public safety threats. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the test was largely successful, calling it an important step for public safety. While there were some minor issues, the system demonstrated its capability to reach a vast number of devices, including those in London's Underground.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to be canonized. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer skills to spread the Catholic faith online by documenting miracles. His canonization ceremony in St. Peter's Square drew tens of thousands, including many young people who see him as a modern role model. The process for sainthood requires the verification of two miracles, which in Acutis's case involved the inexplicable healings of two different children.</p>

The driver, wearing a full racing suit and helmet, was tracked to his home after the most recent sighting. Authorities had previously been unable to press charges because the helmet obscured the driver's identity. The vehicle, identified as a Dallara GP2 car with Ferrari livery, is not street legal. The owner now faces a fine and potential license suspension for driving an unregistered vehicle without proper safety features.</p>

Her appointment was confirmed via a secret ballot, a departure from the usual unanimous approval, reportedly requested by Russia due to her outspoken criticism of its war in Ukraine.

The journey, which took 12 hours, marks the longest open-water voyage in a vessel made of mycelium, the root-like network of fungi. Shoemaker's project aims to showcase the potential of this biodegradable material, known as AquaFung, as a sustainable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation.

          <p>A recent commentary argues that while the Trump administration's tariffs and the elimination of the "de minimis" import exemption create challenges, the panic among small businesses is misdirected. The author contends that only a small fraction of small businesses are directly impacted by these specific trade policies. The larger concern, according to the article, should be the overall health of the economy and consumer purchasing power. As long as income and wealth continue to grow, the economy can likely absorb the price increases caused by tariffs, making broad economic indicators the more critical factor to monitor.

          <p>A large-scale study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has found a consistent pattern of couples sharing the same psychiatric diagnoses. The research, spanning generations from the 1930s to the 1990s, examined nine disorders, including depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," suggests that individuals with similar mental health challenges tend to partner with each other. Researchers theorize this could be due to shared understanding from similar experiences, similar environmental backgrounds, or the social stigma associated with mental illness limiting dating prospects.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles have been eliminated from the Women's Rugby World Cup despite a commanding 60-0 victory against Samoa. Their fate was sealed when Australia secured a bonus point in their loss to England, allowing the Wallaroos to advance to the quarter-finals on points differential. While disappointed, the U.S. team showed significant promise, particularly from young stars like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa. The team's performance, including a dramatic tie with Australia, has stoked hope for the future of American women's rugby ahead of the next World Cup.</p>
