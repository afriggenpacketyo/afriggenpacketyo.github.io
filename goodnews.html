          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's attempt to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Venezuela and Haiti is unlawful. The decision by Judge Edward Chen temporarily preserves the legal status for approximately 1.1 million people, allowing them to continue living and working in the U.S. The judge noted that conditions in their home countries remain dangerous, making their return unsafe. The Department of Homeland Security has indicated it will appeal the ruling, criticizing it as judicial overreach.</p>

          <p>California has officially joined the Northwest Wildland Fire Fighting Compact, a collaborative agreement with twelve other U.S. states and Canadian provinces to share resources for wildfire prevention and suppression. This move allows for the sharing of firefighting personnel and technology when fires become too large for a single jurisdiction to handle. Governor Gavin Newsom framed the partnership as a necessary step to combat catastrophic wildfires fueled by climate change, especially as the Trump administration has reduced the U.S. Forest Service's budget and staff. The alliance aims to bolster regional readiness for an intensifying fire season.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches an estimated $1.8 billion, a new analysis shows significant disparities in lottery spending across the United States. Massachusetts residents spend the most, averaging $915 per year, while North Dakotans spend the least at just $50. The article notes that lottery sales can be a substantial source of state revenue, accounting for up to 3% in some states like Rhode Island. An analyst suggests that accessibility and urbanization play a key role in the spending differences between states.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is refining its version of a major cryptocurrency regulation bill, adding a new provision to ensure that tokenized stocks and other traditional securities are not treated as commodities. The bill, known as the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, aims to establish clear regulatory boundaries between the SEC and the CFTC for digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis expressed hope for a floor vote as early as November, though the draft still requires bipartisan support to pass. This legislative effort follows a separate stablecoin bill signed into law earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, a certified public accountant offers advice to potential winners on managing their newfound wealth. The expert suggests that while the lump sum option of approximately $826.4 million offers greater investment control, it can be "dangerous" for those prone to overspending. The annuity, paid over 29 years, is presented as a "safe bet" that helps preserve the fortune long-term. The primary advice for any winner is to remain anonymous, assemble a team of legal and financial professionals, and pay off all debts before making major life changes.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the US Open final with a decisive victory over veteran Novak Djokovic, winning 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2. The 22-year-old Spaniard demonstrated superior energy and quality, particularly as the 38-year-old Djokovic appeared to fade physically in the third set. Despite moments of brilliance from the 24-time major champion, Alcaraz's powerful serving and aggressive baseline play proved too much to overcome. The 2022 champion will now face either Jannik Sinner or Felix Auger-Aliassime as he seeks another Grand Slam title without having dropped a single set in the tournament.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has announced that advertising technology firm AppLovin and stock trading platform Robinhood Markets will be added to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. The inclusion caused shares of both companies to jump approximately 7% in extended trading. AppLovin will replace MarketAxess Holdings, while Robinhood will take the spot of Caesars Entertainment. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is a significant milestone that typically boosts a company's stock price, as index-tracking funds are required to purchase its shares to reflect the updated composition of the benchmark index.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order creating a new "state sponsors of wrongful detention" designation, empowering the U.S. to impose punitive measures on countries that hold American citizens hostage. The order provides the State Department with tools such as sanctions and travel restrictions, similar to those used against state sponsors of terrorism. The move aims to deter nations from using detained Americans as political leverage and to secure the release of those currently held. The action was praised by the family of Robert Levinson, an American who died in Iranian custody, as a powerful message against hostage-taking.</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic has agreed to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement with authors who accused the firm of illegally using their copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude.

The lawsuit alleged Anthropic trained its models on pirated copies of books from online "shadow libraries." This case is a pivotal moment in the ongoing legal battles between content creators and AI developers over fair use and compensation in the age of generative AI.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers made a last-minute change to their pitching rotation, scratching scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow due to back tightness. Shohei Ohtani, who was recovering from an illness that caused his own previous start to be postponed, volunteered to take the mound on short notice for the series opener against the Baltimore Orioles. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that Glasnow's issue is not serious and praised Ohtani's willingness to step up for the team. Ohtani's start will be his first since August 27, as he continues his return from Tommy John surgery.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the career of designer Giorgio Armani, who passed away at 91, crediting him with revolutionizing red-carpet fashion and building a global empire by harnessing celebrity power. Before Armani, Hollywood awards shows were often sartorial disasters, but he transformed them into major fashion showcases. He rose to prominence by dressing Richard Gere in "American Gigolo," popularizing his unstructured, elegant suits for both men and women. By establishing a boutique on Rodeo Drive and cultivating relationships with stars, he made his brand synonymous with Hollywood glamour, forever changing the intersection of film and high fashion.</p>

          <p>A Boy Scout troop from Santa Barbara is being hailed for rescuing a 78-year-old man who was lost and without supplies in the Emigrant Wilderness. The man, an experienced hiker and former scoutmaster himself, had lost his backpack containing all his food, water, and survival gear. The troop's scoutmaster, trained in search and rescue, recognized the man was in distress, provided him with aid, and used a satellite device to call for a helicopter evacuation. The incident served as a powerful real-world lesson for the scouts on the importance of preparedness in the wilderness.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the state of the England men's national football team nearly a year after Thomas Tuchel was appointed manager. Despite the time elapsed, England has played only four games under his leadership, leaving his tactical identity and strategy still largely undefined. The piece compares his brief tenure to that of previous managers, noting fewer debuts for new players and a continued reliance on an established core. While some statistics suggest a move towards a more aggressive, possession-based style, the overall assessment is that Tuchel's England still feels much like his predecessor's, with upcoming matches seen as a crucial test.</p>

          <p>Naval Base Ventura County has begun its annual Large Force Test Event, which will bring increased noise from aircraft, boats, and drones to the surrounding areas for the next few weeks.

The large-scale exercise utilizes the base's extensive 36,000-square-mile sea and airspace range for joint training.
