          <p>Amidst rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and China, wealthy mainland Chinese investors are increasingly diverting their real estate investments to markets in Thailand, Australia, and Canada. This shift marks a significant change from 2023, when the US was the top choice for Chinese buyers of homes priced above US$5 million. Property agents attribute this trend to geopolitical friction, protectionism, and increased scrutiny of property deals, leading buyers to seek friendlier alternatives. The article notes a more than 50% drop in Chinese investment in US homes since its peak in 2017.</p>

Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, stating it had generated significant revenue and pledged to revise the system to align with the court's decision. While purchased passports are now prohibited, concerns are rising about "golden visas," which offer residence permits for substantial real estate investments, potentially posing security and financial risks to the EU.

          <p>A recent study highlights the increasing presence of technocrats with advanced degrees in China's government, marking a philosophical shift toward meritocracy. Nearly half of the Communist Party's youngest cohort of bureau-level officials hold PhDs, with a significant proportion possessing technical backgrounds. This trend, rooted in the historical reverence for scholar-officials, emphasizes competence over ideology and reflects a pursuit of stability amid economic uncertainty. The rise of technocrats is expected to influence China's approach to its rivalry with the United States.</p>
