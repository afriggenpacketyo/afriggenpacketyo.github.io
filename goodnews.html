          <p>Legendary quarterback Tom Brady, who turned 48, has humorously hinted at the possibility of playing football into his 50s. The seven-time Super Bowl champion shared an NFL post detailing his impressive career statistics by decade, adding the caption "50’s coming soon?" with emojis. While likely not a serious consideration of unretiring for a second time, the post sparked conversation among fans. Brady recently became a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and is also set to begin his role as an NFL broadcaster for Fox.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area. The event caused brief shaking and confusion among residents but resulted in no reported injuries or significant structural damage. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause damage. This tremor comes after a more significant, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the same region in April 2024, reminding residents that seismic activity can occur on the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Florida has quietly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven largely by economic factors and streamlined state regulations. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the surge, finding solar to be cheaper than natural gas, even without subsidies. This growth has occurred despite the state government removing climate change from its official policy language. However, the industry faces future challenges from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 by manufacturing runs through strategic plays rather than relying on power hitting. The victory came despite ongoing concerns about the team's slumping lineup, which has struggled to score runs recently. Key moments included an aggressive send from the third base coach, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. The win capped a nine-game road trip with a positive 5-4 record, providing a needed boost for the team.</p>
