          <p>This Fox News opinion piece asserts that President Trump has skillfully managed international events, particularly in the Iran-Israel conflict. According to the author, Trump gave a tacit green light to Prime Minister Netanyahu to strike Iran after Iran failed to negotiate on its nuclear program. The author draws parallels between Trump's approach and historical figures known for "masterful inactivity." The article also claims Trump is effectively messaging on various issues, including border security and military strength, while criticizing the Democratic Party. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been counter-intuitive, given Ronaldo's affiliation with their rival club, Al-Nassr. Despite being linked to the move due to a FIFA transfer window, Al-Hilal ultimately decided against it, prioritizing long-term team decisions over short-term gains. The executive also mentioned difficulties in reinforcing the team due to players' holiday mindsets and high salary demands. Al-Hilal remains ambitious about reinforcing the team during the traditional transfer window after the tournament. </p>

          <p>British Steel has secured a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks to Network Rail, potentially safeguarding the future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract ensures British Steel will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist products. The deal follows government intervention to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners. The government is also seeking potential private investors for the business, which is considered a matter of national security. </p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs analysts indicate that China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence due to the lifting of regulatory restrictions. The private sector's "animal spirits" are returning, driven by increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion, R&D spending, and fundraising. The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macroeconomic stimulus, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, but has been disproportionately affected by recent economic challenges. </p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an order to bring into force parts of a trade deal agreed between the UK and US last month, reducing tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government hopes the pact will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs. The US will allow up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed on all car imports earlier this year. </p>
