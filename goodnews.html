          <p>China's retail sales in May grew at their fastest pace since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies aimed at stimulating consumption. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year on year, surpassing analysts' estimates, while industrial output slowed to 5.8%. The improving consumption is attributed to the ongoing consumer goods trade-in program, online shopping events, and an increase in foreign tourists. However, challenges remain, including persistent deflation and a slowdown in fixed-asset investment, particularly in the property sector. (not investment advice)</p>
