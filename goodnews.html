          <p>A recent survey reveals that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe that current retail prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns about the increasing cost of this staple food. The survey, conducted by an association of agricultural corporations, indicates that many producers worry consumers might reduce their rice consumption due to prices that have doubled in the past year. In response, the government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers to lower the average price of 4,200 yen per 5 kilograms. The head of the association suggests a reasonable price for both producers and consumers would be 3,000 yen per 5 kg. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka has been omitted from England's squad for their World Cup qualifier against Andorra, with head coach Thomas Tuchel citing Saka's limited training during the week as a likely reason. Saka, who has 43 caps for England, had previously missed Tuchel's first camp due to injury and has only completed one full training session this week. Aston Villa striker Ollie Watkins has also been excluded from the squad due to a minor injury, while the reason for Conor Gallagher's omission remains unclear. England remains unbeaten in World Cup qualifying, having won their opening two matches against Latvia and Albania.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles is reportedly "livid" due to a potential shortage of pheasants at the Sandringham Estate, which may lead to the cancellation of the royal family's cherished Christmas shooting tradition. The King's preference for maintaining the estate's game population without importing birds has resulted in a decline in available birds. Experts suggest this change may prompt the King to reconsider the shooting tradition, which has faced criticism from animal rights groups. Some hope the situation will allow the King to focus on reconciling with Prince Harry and uniting the royal family during the holidays.</p>

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, aiming to reduce dependencies on the US for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has emphasized the need for Europe to shape the new international order and pursue European independence. French President Emmanuel Macron, a strong proponent of strategic autonomy, also supports this vision. The EU is seeking concessions from China on economic matters in exchange for better political ties.</p>

          <p>As graduation season approaches, Chinese universities are implementing regulations on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in theses, setting requirements for the proportion of AI-generated content allowed. Some universities use the AI rate to determine thesis approval, aiming to prevent academic misconduct amid concerns about unregulated AI use in scholarly literature. However, an official publication from the Ministry of Science and Technology warns against relying on AI content detectors, calling it "technological superstition" due to potential false results. The publication notes that even famous Chinese essays have been incorrectly flagged as AI-generated.</p>
