          <p>The Colorado Rockies secured a remarkable 17-16 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates after trailing by nine runs in the first inning. Despite being down 9-0 early and later 15-6, the Rockies mounted a persistent comeback, culminating in a walk-off two-run homer by Brenton Doyle in the bottom of the ninth. This game marked a historic moment in baseball, as it was the first time a team won after allowing nine or more runs in the first inning since 2006. The dramatic win at Coors Field left players and fans in disbelief over the team's resilience.</p>

          <p>Non-profit organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to combat the historical legacy of segregation that has created significant racial disparities in swimming ability and drowning rates in the U.S. These groups provide accessible lessons to Black children and adults, aiming to dismantle stigmas and create a new generation of swimmers, instructors, and lifeguards. Statistics from the CDC show Black children are significantly more likely to drown in pools than their white peers, a crisis linked to decades of exclusion from public aquatic spaces. By offering "swimmerships" and community support, these programs hope to ensure water safety is accessible to everyone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a state policy that removed climate change from official consideration, Florida has surprisingly surpassed California in the addition of new utility-scale solar capacity. This growth is primarily driven by major utilities like Florida Power & Light, which find solar to be a cheaper alternative to natural gas, rather than by environmental mandates. Streamlined state regulations for smaller projects and consumer demand for energy resilience, as demonstrated by solar-powered towns like Babcock Ranch during hurricanes, have also fueled the boom. However, future growth faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and emerging grid constraints.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions have won their series against Australia, though their goal of a 3-0 whitewash was thwarted by a 22-12 defeat in the final Test in Sydney. Head coach Andy Farrell expressed disappointment with the loss but emphasized that the team should be "unbelievably proud" of their overall achievement, which marks the Lions' first series victory since 2013. The Australian Wallabies showed significant improvement throughout the series after a slow start, which some analysts attribute to a lack of preparation before the first Test. The Lions' series win was ultimately secured by a dramatic, last-minute try in the second match.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's Charles Leclerc delivered a stunning performance to take a surprise pole position at the Hungarian Grand Prix, narrowly beating out the favored McLaren drivers, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris. Leclerc expressed his own disbelief after the qualifying session, calling it one of the best poles of his career as he had not expected to be competitive for the top spot. Changing wind conditions in the final qualifying segment made the track tricky, catching out other top drivers, including Red Bull's Max Verstappen who struggled and qualified in eighth. Aston Martin also had a strong showing, with Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll securing the third row.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that tailoring your fitness routine to your personality type could increase enjoyment and long-term adherence. The research linked the "Big Five" personality traits to preferences for certain types of physical activity. For example, extroverts tend to enjoy high-intensity group workouts and team sports, while conscientious individuals prefer goal-oriented activities like marathon training. The findings suggest that if a particular exercise isn't enjoyable, trying a different approach that better suits one's personality may lead to a more sustainable and effective fitness journey.</p>

          <p>A recent article in The Atlantic reflects on the life of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who passed away at 54, and his nuanced portrayal of Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." Warner skillfully balanced Theo's character as a charismatic but academically challenged teenager, avoiding simple caricature and imbuing him with a complex vulnerability. The article explores Theo's character arc, from a "slacker" teen clashing with his father's high expectations to a young adult who finds purpose after a dyslexia diagnosis. It argues that Warner’s performance was crucial to the show, providing a relatable counterpoint to its moralizing and showcasing a journey of growth.</p>

          <p>A review in The Atlantic examines Marc Maron's latest HBO Max comedy special, "Panicked," describing it as the culmination of a decade-long trilogy of work that blends personal anxieties with commentary on catastrophic current events. The special sees Maron at his most controlled, using his signature cantankerous and ruminative style to explore topics from his cat's health to his father's dementia and his own childhood trauma. The reviewer notes that while Maron's temperament has softened over the years, his creative voice remains consistent, using comedy not just for entertainment but as a vehicle for self-reflection.</p>

          <p>A new survey from Ally Bank reveals that nearly 60% of millennials and Gen Zers feel that spending on their social lives is negatively impacting their financial goals. While connecting with friends is important for well-being, many in these generations report overspending on social activities, with an average monthly outlay of $250. Financial experts suggest that the key is to consciously budget for social activities rather than letting them derail financial progress. They also recommend finding free or low-cost ways to socialize and being open with friends about budget limitations to avoid the pressure of overspending.</p>
