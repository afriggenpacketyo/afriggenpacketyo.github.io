          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 17:24:21 EDT</div>

          <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu has expressed a desire for Wimbledon and other Grand Slams to adopt an innovative mixed doubles event, similar to the one recently trialed at the US Open. Raducanu, who partnered with Carlos Alcaraz in the New York event, believes the format, which included a $1 million prize and a shorter "fast four" style before the main singles tournaments, was a significant success. She argues that such an addition would generate more buzz and engagement for the sport. While other majors traditionally resist change, the success of the US Open event has sparked further discussion about the future of mixed doubles in tennis.</p>

          <p>Ether, a leading cryptocurrency, achieved its first new record since 2021 after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at potential interest rate adjustments during his Jackson Hole speech. Powell's comments, suggesting a shift in policy stance due to evolving economic risks, led to significant short liquidations in Ether, pushing its price higher. Crypto trading firms noted a panicked repositioning by traders, anticipating a September rate cut and aligning with an easing stance from the administration and the Fed. This article highlights how regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, largely powered by Ethereum, have positioned Ether as a major macro trade for the coming years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has acquired a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, a significant $8.9 billion investment largely funded through CHIPS Act grants. President Trump hailed the deal as a "great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL," even though the government purchased shares at a discount. This action underscores a distinct shift in U.S. industrial policy, with the administration taking a more active role in the private sector to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This article details Intel's strategic efforts to enhance its chip production capabilities on U.S. soil, despite facing challenges and construction slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported to El Salvador earlier this year, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee and is returning to Maryland. His release follows a federal judge's ruling blocking immigration authorities from detaining him again upon his return. Abrego Garcia faces human smuggling charges, which his attorneys argue are "vindictive and selective prosecution" after his initial wrongful deportation. This article highlights his reunion with family, the conditions of his release including electronic monitoring, and the ongoing legal fight against his charges and potential future deportation attempts by the Trump administration.</p>
