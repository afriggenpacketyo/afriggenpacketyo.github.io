          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, following announcements of a plan to sell weapons to NATO allies, which can then be transferred to Ukraine. This strategy aims to expedite military aid by moving equipment from closer European countries rather than directly from U.S. factories. The meeting comes as the Trump administration also considers imposing severe sanctions on Russia's economy and its international partners, with a proposed 500% tariff on goods from countries buying Russian energy. This diplomatic and military maneuvering represents a critical juncture in the Western response to the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square celebrated a significant cultural milestone by performing the 5,000th episode of its weekly program, "Music & the Spoken Word." The broadcast, which began in 1929, is the longest-running consecutive program of its kind and was attended by over 11,500 people in Salt Lake City. The choir, famously dubbed "America’s Choir" by Ronald Reagan, has been a consistent presence through major historical events like the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic. The event highlighted the program's enduring legacy and its ability to provide a source of comfort and unity for millions of listeners weekly for nearly 100 years.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants in an 11-inning game, concluding the first half of the season with a significant series win. Starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings and continuing his impressive season. However, the team's bullpen struggles were evident when closer Tanner Scott gave up a two-run homer in the ninth, blowing the initial lead. The Dodgers rallied in the 11th inning, with key hits from Freddie Freeman and others, to clinch the win and maintain their comfortable lead in the National League West division.</p>

          <p>After a rocky start with a loss to France, England's Lionesses have found their form, securing a spot in the Euro 2025 quarter-finals with decisive wins over the Netherlands and Wales. Manager Sarina Wiegman's tactical adjustments, including moving Lauren James to a wider role and starting Ella Toone, have proven effective, leading to a display of dominant, free-flowing football. The team now faces a formidable Swedish side in a highly anticipated match, a repeat of the Euro 2022 semi-final. Players and analysts note that the initial defeat may have provided the necessary urgency and motivation for England to build momentum.</p>

          <p>King Charles has invited President Donald Trump for a state visit in September, strategically scheduled for when the UK Parliament is not in session for its party conference break. This timing effectively removes the possibility of the U.S. president addressing Parliament, an event that would have likely proven controversial given criticism from some MPs. The visit, an unprecedented second for a modern U.S. president, is seen as a diplomatic move as Prime Minister Keir Starmer continues to engage with the Trump administration on key issues like trade tariffs. The arrangement avoids a potential political flashpoint while still affording the honor of a state visit.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump will make an official state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17-19, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This marks an unprecedented second state visit for a U.S. president, a gesture typically not extended. The visit will include a full ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, with senior members of the Royal Family in attendance. The article notes the event could serve as a powerful tool of soft diplomacy for the British government amid ongoing discussions over trade and international policy with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The perception of lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is transforming from its historical association with gangs and crime to a celebrated form of community artistry and service. This cultural shift is highlighted in Española, the self-proclaimed lowrider capital, where car clubs now focus on family, faith, and community support. Artists like Rob Vanderslice, once involved in gang culture, now mentor at-risk youth, teaching them to build lowrider bicycles as a positive outlet. The evolution is marked by public recognition, including a Santa Fe museum exhibition, showcasing these customized vehicles as moving art exhibits and an important part of the region's heritage.</p>

          <p>In a recent address, financial analyst Jim Cramer urged investors to divorce their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly concerning the Trump presidency. He argued that despite widespread personal dislike for the president, the current economic environment is surprisingly bullish for the stock market, driven by individual investors rather than institutions. Cramer posits that a combination of deregulation, a pro-business stance, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence is creating conditions for market growth, even with potentially inflationary tariffs. He suggests that investors who focus on these underlying economic forces stand to benefit regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," a raw and quirky R&B project that marks a departure from his more polished pop work. The 21-track LP features a cooled-out, improvisatory feel, with collaborators like Mk.gee and Dijon contributing to its murky, chillwave-influenced sound. The album comes after a period of personal and professional change for the 31-year-old artist, and its messy, authentic vibe reflects this tumult. With this release, Bieber aligns himself with the idiosyncratic style of modern pop stars who favor pursuing odd impulses over a streamlined vision, resulting in a disarming and often beautiful collection.</p>
