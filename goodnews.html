        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An emotionally safe parenting style emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, building resilience, trust, and connection through open communication. Unlike stricter or softer parenting models, this framework focuses on creating a safe space for children to express their feelings without judgment. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, avoid shaming, and view misbehavior as stress signals rather than defiance. Practicing this approach involves inner work for parents to understand their own emotional triggers, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame by reconnecting after conflicts. This parenting style prioritizes communication and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves.</p>

          <p>China and Russia's joint statement omitted phrases that could provoke Japan, demonstrating China's desire to stabilize relations with Japan amid increasing tensions with the United States. The initial draft included commitments to "maintaining the security of Northeast Asia," potentially signaling increased joint military activities near Japan, which Japan has repeatedly expressed concerns over. A reference to Chinese companies investing in a special economic zone on disputed islands claimed by Japan was also removed. While the document urged Japan to learn from its past and distance itself from militarism, these adjustments suggest China's strategic balancing act in the region.</p>

She could face Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals and Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals, but must first beat either Jil Teichmann or Lucrezia Stefanini to advance.</p>

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army wife during the Vietnam War, revolutionized the U.S. military's casualty notification process. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used to inform families of service member deaths, Moore lobbied for a more dignified approach. She worked with the local Western Union office to personally deliver the news and provide comfort to grieving widows. Now, service members notify families in person and offer ongoing support. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor Julie and her husband, marking the first time a military base was named for a civilian.</p>

          <p>A schism has emerged among Democratic policy experts regarding the 'abundance agenda,' a set of reforms aimed at streamlining housing, infrastructure, and government processes. Supporters view it as a path to prosperity and political dominance, while critics denounce it as a corporate-aligned infiltration. The agenda critiques the past half-century of American government and challenges the influence of activist organizations within the Democratic Party. It seeks to provide moderate Democrats with a positive identity beyond mere opposition to progressive positions. This internal conflict reflects a broader debate over the Democratic Party's direction and who should lead it.</p>

The poll indicates that 44.7% believe rice prices should drop below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, lower than the government's pledged target. Koizumi plans to sell stockpiled rice directly to retailers to control prices, aiming for availability at 2,000 yen per 5 kg.
