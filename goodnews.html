          <p>Ex-England cricketer Stuart Broad has labeled Australia's current team as their weakest since England's last Ashes series victory there in 2010-2011. His comments came in response to a prediction from former Australian player David Warner that England would suffer a heavy defeat in the upcoming series. Broad pointed to Australia's reliance on an aging bowling attack and fitness questions surrounding their captain, Pat Cummins, as key vulnerabilities. He suggested these factors create a rare opportunity for England to be competitive, making for a potentially brilliant series.</p>

The bank's profit increased by 12% to $14.39 billion, with overall revenue rising 9% to $47.12 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon credited a resilient U.S. economy for the strong performance but also noted that the firm is preparing for potential turbulence ahead due to geopolitical conditions and the risk of inflation. The bank increased its provision for credit losses, signaling preparation for higher loan defaults. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weeks of drought across large parts of the United States, particularly the Northeast and the West, have led to a less vibrant and shorter autumn foliage season this year. The lack of water stresses trees, causing their leaves to brown and fall prematurely rather than turning brilliant shades of red, orange, and yellow. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40% of the country was in a drought in early October. Despite the dulled colors, tourism related to leaf-peeping has remained resilient in many traditional destinations.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Germany has found that only about 5% of employees are worried that artificial intelligence could threaten their jobs within the next five years. This widespread lack of concern exists despite expert estimates suggesting that nearly 40% of jobs in Germany involve tasks that could be largely automated. The survey also revealed a significant knowledge gap, with less than 40% of workers reporting they had received any AI-related training, even in companies where the technology is already in use.</p>

          <p>Maine's two-term Democratic Governor, Janet Mills, has officially announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate, aiming to challenge longtime Republican incumbent Susan Collins. Her entry sets up a potentially competitive Democratic primary, as she was recruited by national party leaders, pitting her against more progressive candidates already in the race. The 2026 contest is considered a top target for Democrats in their effort to regain a majority in the Senate, though no Democrat has won a Senate race in Maine since 1988.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army is training soldiers in an ancient mental calculation technique to serve as "human abacuses" in high-stakes combat situations. The strategy is designed as a countermeasure for scenarios where advanced technology, such as radar or digital targeting systems, might fail or be compromised. A recent state media broadcast showcased a soldier using these skills to predict the trajectories of three targets in seconds during a simulated radar failure, demonstrating the technique's potential battlefield effectiveness.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Nobel Prize in economics has been co-awarded to economic historian Joel Mokyr for his influential research explaining the drivers of sustained economic growth. Mokyr's work focuses on why the Industrial Revolution began in Britain, highlighting the crucial link between the scientific breakthroughs of the Enlightenment and a skilled class of artisans and entrepreneurs who could apply those new ideas practically. His theories underscore that for technology to fuel growth, a society must have both innovation and the capacity to implement it.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Cyber-Security Centre (NCSC) is strongly recommending that businesses keep physical, paper copies of their cyber-attack contingency plans. This advice comes as the agency reports a significant increase in "nationally significant" cyber-attacks that have crippled major companies by disabling their IT systems. The NCSC is urging a focus on "resilience engineering," which involves creating plans for how to operate and communicate without computer networks, ensuring that organizations can absorb and recover from an attack.</p>
