          <h2>Chinese Researchers Use Ancient Philosophy to Understand Yeast Metabolism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 00:00:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers in China have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, finding parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganized the understanding of yeast metabolism into four distinct phases that overlap and transition sequentially, triggered by specific molecular mechanisms. This mirrors the traditional Chinese medicine concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke. The team's model reflects a unique metabolic state for each phase, aligning with the "four symbols" theory that seeks balance between passive and active forces to maintain health and harmony.</p>

          <p>Voters in Tokyo are participating in the metropolitan assembly election, which is seen as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is navigating a minority government, and the Liberal Democratic Party aims to retain its seats despite low approval ratings. The election features a rare overlap with the upper house election, and major parties are using social media and street speeches to attract voters, especially those unaffiliated. Key issues include support for households facing inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke.</p>

Blaze was a 19-year-old Ivy League student targeted for who he was. The couple found solace in the hundreds of hand-painted stones left at Borrego Park, where Blaze was killed, with messages of tolerance, love, and peace. His killer, Samuel Woodward, was found guilty of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are launching "property supermarkets" to support the country's housing market, which has seen declining prices and subdued buyer sentiment. Chengdu is the latest city to introduce a homebuying platform in partnership with state-owned and private developers, featuring over 50 projects on a mobile app. These platforms aim to improve transparency and efficiency in homebuying, with similar initiatives being rolled out in other cities like Suzhou and Weihai. These platforms consolidate information and bundle services such as mortgage applications and property registration.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, conducted with Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed issues with the original investigation, including untested blood spots and foreign male DNA on key items. The prosecution admitted that the DNA evidence was different in quality and quantity than presented at trial. Though her conviction was overturned, the DA's office initially decided to retry her, but then ultimately dismissed the charges, granting her freedom after a long legal battle.</p>

          <p>Jessi Toronjo, who lost her mother, stepfather, and two sisters in a 1989 murder, continues to heal decades after the tragedy. Jessi was just 9 years old when her stepbrother Jeff Pelley was arrested, and the motive? Prosecutors say the then-17-year-old Pelley wiped out his family in anger at not being able to drive to his prom. Pelley was ultimately convicted, but the case continues to wind its way through the courts. Jessi's journey involved reconnecting with a childhood friend, writing a book, and confronting her dissociative identity disorder.</p>
