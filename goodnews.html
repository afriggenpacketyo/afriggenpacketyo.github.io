          <p>South Africa's Presidential spokesperson, Vincent Magwenya, stated that President Cyril Ramaphosa anticipated a confrontational "show" from President Donald Trump during their meeting at the White House. Magwenya noted that Ramaphosa remained calm and dignified throughout the exchange, which included Trump playing videos that Magwenya dismissed as "an absolute lie" and a "poor compilation of old videos." Despite the tensions, Magwenya emphasized that the fundamentals of the relationship between the two countries remain strong, particularly regarding trade and South Africa's mineral resources that are needed by the U.S.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines will implement a new policy requiring passengers to keep battery packs and portable charging devices visible during flights, effective May 28, as a safety precaution to quickly address potential fires. The airline emphasized that safety is their top priority and this measure aims to mitigate risks associated with lithium-ion batteries, which can overheat and cause fires. The FAA already prohibits spare lithium-ion batteries in checked bags, but Southwest's policy further mandates that these devices be removed from carry-on bags and remain in plain sight when in use, prohibiting charging in overhead bins.</p>

          <p>Freedom Debt Relief, founded in 2002, is a debt settlement company that negotiates with creditors to reduce total debt in exchange for lump-sum payments. The process involves a free debt evaluation, setting up a dedicated FDIC-insured account, negotiation with creditors, and approval and payment upon reaching a settlement. Fees range from 15% to 25% of the total enrolled debt, and the program typically spans 24 to 48 months. While it can substantially reduce debt, it may also severely damage credit scores and involves considerable costs; it should be viewed as a serious financial intervention and not a quick fix.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings concluded with the decision not to ban the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal to ban the play failed to reach the required 75% majority, with a vote of 22-10. The Eagles responded with social media posts celebrating the play's survival. The debate over the "tush push" gained momentum after the Eagles' successful playoff run and Super Bowl LIX victory, with concerns raised about player safety and the play's almost guaranteed success in short-yardage situations.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has made significant strides in cleaning up its streams by implementing a simple solution: keeping cows out of the water. Farmer Grant Victor fenced off his cattle from Horse Creek, which runs through his land, and quickly observed positive results such as reduced veterinarian bills and the return of wildlife. As a result of practices like these, approximately 100 streams in Oklahoma, previously polluted by farmland runoff, have been restored to health, more than any other state according to the EPA. This initiative demonstrates how straightforward conservation efforts can lead to substantial environmental improvements.</p>

You don't necessarily have to pay today's top price, as fractional gold offers a lower entry point. While gold prices fluctuate, they generally increase over time, so it may be beneficial to invest sooner rather than later. Keep them as a small but healthy portion of a diversified portfolio to better ensure long-term investing success. (not investment advice)</p>
