          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, formalizing unpaid leave for Muslim employees and students on two major Islamic holidays, has sparked public debate in Germany. Tabloids sensationalized the news, claiming "extra holidays" for Muslims, which legal and Islamic scholars dismiss as merely formalizing existing religious freedom practices. The article explains that Germany's public holidays are a patchwork of federal and state regulations, largely rooted in Christian traditions.
