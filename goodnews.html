          <p>Starbucks is set to roll out a generative AI assistant, "Green Dot Assist," developed with Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform, initially in 35 locations this month, with a broader launch planned for fiscal 2026. This initiative aims to streamline baristas' tasks and accelerate service, aligning with CEO Brian Niccol's goal to reduce order times to four minutes. The AI assistant will provide quick answers to barista questions via a tablet, covering topics from drink recipes to equipment troubleshooting, and future plans include automated IT ticketing and shift coverage suggestions. The company hopes to improve efficiency and personalization for customers by integrating this technology. Optimism surrounds the potential for AI to positively impact customer experience and employee satisfaction.</p>

Deep Research taps into a vast database of business and financial documents, including expert call transcripts, to generate research and market insights at superhuman speed. This tool can analyze hundreds of interviews on a single company, providing comprehensive reports in minutes that would take human analysts days or weeks. Kokko emphasizes that AI will enhance analysts' capabilities by providing rapid summaries, customizable reports, and diverse perspectives, allowing them to focus on higher-level strategic thinking.

          <p>The 'Ballerina' movie expands the John Wick universe by focusing on world-building and inventive action, starring Ana de Armas as Eve, a young assassin seeking revenge for her father's death. Despite a generic plot, the film succeeds when it delves into the bizarre depths of the Wick-iverse, such as a cultish village in the Austrian Alps where every inhabitant is out to kill her. The movie features creative stunts, including flamethrower duels and grenade-laden fight sequences, capturing the grim humor and improvisation characteristic of the John Wick series. While 'Ballerina' opened below expectations, it ultimately serves as a junky but fun addition to the franchise, appealing to fans through its expansion of the Wick canon.</p>

          <p>Experts warn that dirty hummingbird feeders can be harmful, even deadly, to the birds they are intended to help. If sugar water is left out too long, it spoils and attracts microbes that can cause infections, including candida, which causes tongue swelling and starvation. While not all microbes are dangerous, it is common for individual birds to be sickened by dirty feeders. The solution is regular cleaning, every two to three days in spring and fall, and daily or every other day in summer, with hot water or a vinegar and water mixture. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended to provide natural food sources.</p>
