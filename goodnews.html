          <p>Global asset managers are growing more optimistic about Chinese stocks as the Shanghai Composite Index reaches a 10-year high. Investment directors suggest that the rally could be sustained by domestic investors moving away from low-yield fixed-income products and by Beijing's focus on technological innovation. The combined US$20 trillion value of onshore and offshore equities is attracting renewed interest from overseas investors, who had previously been exiting the market. This shift indicates a potential for Chinese equities to catch up with other global markets that are trading near historic highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States. The court upheld a lower court's ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges found that the homeland security secretary lacked the authority to end a prior extension of TPS, as the governing statute is designed to be insulated from shifting electoral politics. This decision provides temporary relief for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who have permission to legally live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's appearance in a Los Angeles court for a civil assault trial has generated significant online attention due to her candid and animated testimony. The rapper is being sued by a security guard who alleges she was attacked in 2018, a claim Cardi B denies, stating the encounter was only a verbal fight. During cross-examination, moments of courtroom drama went viral, including the rapper's witty responses to questions about her physical state while pregnant and her use of wigs. While some social media users found the exchanges comedic, others questioned if the attorney's focus on her hair and nails carried racist or misogynistic undertones.</p>

The initiative, run by the charity Power2, aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the older students, which in turn boosts their engagement with school. Participants have reported significant improvements in their confidence and attendance, with one student's attendance more than doubling. The program has shown promising results, with data indicating that 78% of participants improve their attitude toward learning and 83% show enhanced self-esteem, demonstrating a novel approach to tackling persistent school absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September, sparking speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles III, amid signs of easing family tensions. Unlike his last visit, the King will be in the UK, creating an opportunity for a face-to-face encounter. Recent developments, including a reported meeting between the communications teams for both sides and the conclusion of Harry's security-related court case, suggest a slight shift in mood. While trust remains a significant hurdle and a reconciliation with his brother Prince William seems distant, the upcoming visit is viewed as the best chance in some time for a peaceful resolution between father and son.</p>

She explained her artistic interpretation as being about understanding control and the lack of it, and the humanity of allowing oneself to make mistakes. Amid the controversy, Carpenter released an alternative, "approved by God" cover, but stands by her original vision, emphasizing that she aims to please her fans, not outside critics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," attempts to capture the gritty, anything-goes atmosphere of late-90s New York City but ultimately falls short. The film stars Austin Butler as a bartender mistakenly targeted by the city's criminal underworld, but his natural charm makes it difficult to believe he is a down-on-his-luck former athlete. While the movie successfully evokes a nostalgic, grungy Lower Manhattan aesthetic and features a star-studded cast, its characters remain cartoonish and the plot lacks genuine stakes. The film is described as a disposable thriller that prioritizes style over substance, failing to live up to the classic New York crime movies it references.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was eliminated from the US Open after a decisive loss to Elena Rybakina, marking her fourth Grand Slam defeat this year against a top-ranked opponent. Raducanu believes that the world's best players are especially motivated to beat her, stating they consistently "raise their game" and have a "point to prove." Despite the tough losses, she sees progress in her game over the past few months under her new coach, Francisco Roig. Her focus now is on improving key areas like her serve and closing the performance gap with the elite players before the next major tournament in Australia.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta has embarked on a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. His protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to inaction by the Republican-controlled state legislature. The funding crisis has already led to service reductions affecting thousands of residents, including students and workers. Kenyatta is using the march, which he calls a "time honoured American tradition," to highlight the issue and pressure lawmakers to pass one of several bipartisan proposals to fund mass transit.</p>
