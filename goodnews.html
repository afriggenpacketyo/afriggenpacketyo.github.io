          <p>Reigning champion Miki Sudo won her 11th Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in the women's division, consuming 33 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes. The annual Fourth of July event in Coney Island, New York, saw Sudo pull ahead in the second half of the competition to secure the victory, though she finished well below her 2024 world record of 51. In the men's competition, all eyes are on Joey Chestnut, who is returning after being banned last year, as he aims to reclaim his title. The contest follows strict rules, including a ten-minute time limit and disqualification for vomiting, with winners receiving a $20,000 prize.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Ben Shelton swiftly won his second-round Wimbledon match against Rinky Hijikata, needing only 70 seconds to secure victory after the game was controversially suspended the previous night due to fading light. Shelton, who was serving for the match when play was halted, returned to the court and fired three aces and an unreturnable serve to close out the win. He later explained his frustration with the previous night's decision, which was made because the Hawk-Eye line-calling system was about to shut down. Despite the bizarre circumstances, Shelton found humor in the situation and advanced to the third round.</p>

          <h2>Pop Mart's 'Blind Box' Toy Business Appears Resilient Despite Chinese State Media Criticism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 11:12:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts believe that Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu dolls, will likely withstand criticism from Chinese state media regarding the addictive nature of "blind box" toys. While an editorial called for tighter regulations on such sales to minors, Pop Mart's primary demographic consists of young adults, not children. Furthermore, the company's significant and rapidly growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, provide a cushion against potential domestic regulatory impacts. Despite challenges like scalpers and production delays, the brand's appeal, driven by what some call the "dopamine economy," remains strong amid China's otherwise sluggish consumer market.

          <p>Following a four-game sweep that propelled the Toronto Blue Jays ahead of the New York Yankees in the AL East standings, the Blue Jays' broadcast team took a moment to taunt a rival announcer. The on-air jab was directed at Yankees announcer Michael Kay, who had recently claimed Toronto was "not a first-place team." The sweep marked a historic moment for the Blue Jays and highlighted the Yankees' recent struggles, as they have lost a significant lead in the division. The rivalry commentary adds another layer of drama to the shifting baseball season.</p>

          <p>An international security affairs specialist has suggested that the United States could learn from China's high-tech development model to reinvigorate its own rust-belt cities. Following a trip to China, the analyst pointed to the "Wuhan model," where second-tier cities have successfully integrated university research with private industry to create advanced manufacturing clusters like Optics Valley. This observation comes amid a temporary de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. The idea proposes that such a strategy could foster economic growth in struggling American industrial regions and potentially help stabilize superpower relations through cooperative learning and development.</p>

          <p>One of Sweden's most wanted criminals, identified by media as 35-year-old Ismail Abdo, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is the alleged head of the Rumba crime organization and is accused of orchestrating drug trafficking and a surge of violent crime in Sweden from abroad. His arrest is the result of collaboration between Turkish and Swedish law enforcement. Sweden has been grappling with a significant increase in gang-related violence, including shootings and bombings, often orchestrated by leaders operating internationally. Abdo was formerly allied with another major crime boss, and their subsequent feud is linked to a new wave of violence.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Sonay Kartal has reached the fourth round of Wimbledon for the first time after a decisive 6-4, 6-2 victory over France's Diane Parry. After a nervous start on Court One, the 23-year-old rallied to win nine consecutive games, overpowering her opponent with strong serving and powerful shots. Kartal, who was ranked outside the top 800 just three years ago, has had an impressive run, defeating the 20th seed in the first round. Her success could see her become the top-ranked British player, marking a remarkable rise for the athlete who is now the fourth unseeded British woman to reach this stage this century.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered what they describe as a 125,000-year-old "fat factory" operated by Neanderthals at a site in Germany. Analysis of bone fragments and tools suggests that these early humans systematically smashed animal bones and boiled them on a large scale to extract nutritious fat. This finding challenges the stereotype of Neanderthals as unintelligent, indicating they possessed sophisticated planning, organizational skills, and an understanding of nutrition. They likely rendered the fat to avoid protein poisoning, a dangerous condition resulting from a diet of lean meat, showcasing their ability to strategically exploit their environment for survival.</p>

          <p>A 72-year-old man has been indicted for murder in connection with the 1983 disappearance of his former girlfriend, Teresa Peroni, thanks to advancements in DNA technology. Peroni was 27 when she vanished after being seen walking into a wooded area with her then-boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, during a party in Selma, Oregon. The case went cold for years until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through new DNA analysis. A grand jury indicted Sanfratello based on this new evidence, and he has been detained in California, awaiting extradition to Oregon to face the charges.</p>

          <p>After a ten-year fight for justice, the former UK government's independent advisor on sexual assault, Emily Hunt, has seen her abuser imprisoned. Christopher Killick was sentenced to three years for harassment after repeatedly breaching a restraining order by tweeting about Ms. Hunt. Killick had previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism in 2020 for filming Hunt while she was unconscious in 2015, a case that led to a change in UK law. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue the case, expressed relief at the sentence, stating she will finally feel safe while he is incarcerated.</p>

          <p>Astronomers are currently tracking 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system. The comet, estimated to be about 12.4 miles wide, was spotted by a telescope in Chile and poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach in October being over 1.5 times the distance from the Earth to the sun. Scientists are still determining its precise trajectory and composition, but its discovery highlights the increasing capability of modern telescopes to detect such rare visitors. These interstellar objects are considered pristine specimens from other planetary systems, offering valuable insights into the galaxy.</p>
