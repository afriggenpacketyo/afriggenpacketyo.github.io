          <p>Costco's shares experienced a slight decrease despite the company's announcement of quarterly earnings and revenue surpassing expectations, with an 8% year-over-year sales increase. The company's net income for the quarter rose to $1.90 billion, or $4.28 per share, compared to $1.68 billion, or $3.78 per share, in the previous year. Costco is exploring strategies to mitigate tariff costs, including expediting orders, rerouting goods, and sourcing more private-label items domestically; while some price increases have been implemented for discretionary items, the company has absorbed costs for staple goods like pineapples and bananas. The company's CFO noted that approximately one-third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods, with about 8% originating from China. (not investment advice)</p>

The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to be seen as an ally to the crypto industry, as well as the Justice Department shutting down its crypto enforcement team.

          <p>A California court has sided with the California Coastal Commission, ordering Sable Offshore Corp. to cease construction and repairs on offshore oil pipelines until necessary approvals are obtained. The ruling upholds a cease and desist order issued by the commission, which claims Sable violated the Coastal Act by performing upgrades without permits. Sable, however, insists it is operating within original permits from the 1980s and plans to appeal the judge's ruling. This legal battle follows Sable's announcement of resuming oil production, which drew criticism from officials and environmentalists, who argue the company cannot be trusted to operate safely.</p>
