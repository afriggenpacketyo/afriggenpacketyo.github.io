        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. The article analyzes the tactical dynamics, noting that the outcome will likely hinge on who better manages the pressure of the occasion. Swiatek holds the edge in big-match experience, but Anisimova's underdog status and aggressive, free-swinging style could make her particularly dangerous. Although they have not met at the tour level, their shared history in junior tennis means they are familiar with each other's games, setting the stage for an intriguing contest.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is promoting a new foreign policy doctrine centered on national sovereignty, framed as "Australia first." In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to shape its own future, balancing its relationships with key partners like the United States and rivals such as China. This recalibration comes as his government navigates the complexities of the AUKUS security pact and rising geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific. The approach aims to root Australia's defense and foreign policy in strategic reality rather than historical tradition.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after years of being perceived as having severe cognitive disabilities. His father, Sumit, discovered that Viraj could communicate by typing with his right thumb on an iPad, unleashing his hidden intellectual capabilities. In less than three years, Viraj progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect score on his ACT, and graduated from high school. Viraj hopes his story serves as a breakthrough for the entire non-speaking autistic community.</p>

          <p>Nearly one year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is showcasing enhanced security protocols. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones for aerial surveillance and established mobile command posts to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, addressing key failures from the 2024 incident. The changes come after an internal investigation led to the suspension of six personnel. Officials state they are focused on implementing the best technology and procedures to prevent a repeat of the attack.</p>

          <p>A TUI flight from Cancun, Mexico, to London, England, was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangor, Maine, after a fight broke out between two passengers. The diversion resulted in all 267 passengers spending an unplanned night in Maine, as the flight crew had exceeded their duty hours. U.S. Customs and Border Protection removed the two disruptive individuals from the aircraft. While no criminal charges were filed, the two passengers were processed for expedited removal and returned to their home countries on separate flights, and the flight continued to London the next day.</p>

          <p>A judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit from the state of New Hampshire, allowing the case to move forward. The lawsuit alleges that the social media company intentionally uses manipulative and "addictive design features" to exploit young users for commercial gain. New Hampshire's Attorney General hailed the decision as a key step toward holding TikTok accountable for practices that put children at risk. This case is part of a broader trend of legal actions by states targeting the design and safety policies of tech platforms, rather than user-generated content.</p>
