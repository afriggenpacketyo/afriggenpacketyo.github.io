          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. will split profits with Japan from American-based projects funded by Japan's $550 billion investment, part of a recent tariff deal. Profits will be shared equally until Japan recoups its initial investment, after which the U.S. will receive 90% and Japan 10%. This initiative aims to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, facilitating job creation and economic growth. Lutnick emphasized the deal's mutual benefits, providing Japan with lower tariffs and the U.S. with substantial capital, though some of Trump's tariffs remain in legal dispute.

This strategic move positions SK Hynix ahead of rivals like Samsung Electronics and Micron Technologies, solidifying its market leadership as a primary HBM supplier for global AI giant Nvidia. The announcement triggered a surge in the company's stock, contributing to an impressive $80 billion increase in its market capitalization this year.

          <p>Chelsea striker Liam Delap will be sidelined until December after sustaining a hamstring injury during a match against Fulham, forcing him out for 10 to 12 weeks. The 22-year-old, a £30m summer signing, had featured in all three games this season, making his absence a significant blow to the team. In response, Chelsea has recalled striker Marc Guiu from a loan spell to provide immediate cover, especially following Nicolas Jackson's transfer to Bayern Munich. This development reshuffles the team's attacking strategy, with Joao Pedro expected to take a more prominent role upfront for the upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, a leading global toymaker, has expanded its product offerings by launching a new line of Popop-branded gold jewellery, featuring popular characters like Baby Molly. This strategic move aims to capitalize on the immense popularity of its collectible toys, with items ranging from 980 yuan to 56,800 yuan. The introduction of this high-end jewellery line, following an earlier silver collection, significantly boosted the company's Hong Kong-listed shares, which have already seen a year-to-date gain of over 200%. Pop Mart's substantial market valuation now exceeds major global rivals, highlighting its strong brand appeal and successful diversification efforts.</p>

          <p>The European Union accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its popular Office productivity apps, allowing the company to avoid a substantial antitrust fine. This decision follows accusations last year that Microsoft breached competition rules through the "abusive" bundling of its products, stemming from a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack. Under the binding agreement, valid for at least seven years, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, ensure interoperability with rival tools, and facilitate data migration. These measures aim to foster fair competition and address concerns within the workplace communication market.</p>
