          <p>Markets across the Middle East showed resilience following the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, fueled by expectations that Washington's intervention might expedite the conflict's resolution. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul initially rose before declining slightly, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 experienced a notable increase. Analysts suggest that the Gulf's diplomatic stance, advocating for peaceful resolution and distancing itself from the conflict, has shielded it from significant market turmoil. The market may be pricing in the removal of the Iranian threat, potentially benefiting international investors.</p>

This is an especially impressive achievement for Kessler, who had only secured her first career grass-court win the week prior at Queen's.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated assisted departure flights from Israel, with two flights departing from Tel Aviv to Athens carrying approximately 70 U.S. citizens and their families. This action follows confusion about whether the U.S. government would aid in evacuating American citizens. Ambassador Mike Huckabee announced the initiative, urging Americans in Israel needing assistance to register with the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The U.S. State Department has also placed Israel under a Level 4 travel advisory due to armed conflict and civil unrest, with commercial airlines pausing flights from Israel to the United States.</p>
