          <p>In a solemn ceremony at Historic St. Mary's City, the remains of 65 of Maryland's earliest Catholic settlers were reinterred more than 300 years after their original burials. The event, attended by the Archbishop of Baltimore, aimed to honor these forgotten founders who pioneered religious liberty in North America. Researchers studied the remains, gaining insights into colonial life before their respectful return to a new burial vault in a reconstructed 17th-century chapel. The ceremony highlighted the settlers' legacy of tolerance and coexistence, a message organizers emphasized as relevant today.</p>

The market surge has created a dilemma for many, who are unsure whether to buy more, sell their current holdings, or wait for prices to stabilize. The article highlights the frustration of individual investors who may have sold too early, missing out on further gains, while retail shoppers show hesitation in purchasing at such elevated prices.

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's plan to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, ruling that the administration's justification did not meet the high legal standard for such an action without the governor's consent. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, stated that the protests in the city were not disruptive enough to warrant military intrusion into civil affairs. The ruling, which prevents the deployment of 200 soldiers for at least 14 days, was celebrated by Oregon officials as a defense of state sovereignty and the rule of law. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Six Democratic candidates vying for the California governorship gathered at a labor forum in San Diego to address pressing issues such as housing affordability, the cost of living, and healthcare. The candidates, including former U.S. Health Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Assembly Majority Leader Ian Calderon, sought to differentiate themselves through their political experience and personal stories. They largely agreed on the key challenges facing the state while making their respective cases to the influential American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union. The forum provided an early look at the developing field to succeed Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown continues, a significant disconnect is emerging between political turmoil and buoyant financial markets, with major equity indexes hitting record highs. The article notes that while some analysts warn of growing market bubbles, particularly in the technology and credit sectors, investor sentiment remains risk-on, with billions flowing into global equities. This paradoxical situation creates a conflicted mood, where record market performance coexists with low consumer sentiment. The piece also touches on "Swiftonomics," highlighting the economic impact of cultural phenomena like Taylor Swift's latest album release and tour. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of the Mirage 2000, a highly agile multirole fighter jet manufactured by the French aerospace company Dassault Aviation. Developed in the late 1970s to replace the Mirage III, the jet is known for its speed, maneuverability, and effectiveness in both high-altitude and low-speed flight. Production was handled across several Dassault facilities in France, with final assembly and testing in Mérignac. While the Mirage 2000 has been a mainstay for the French Air Force and several export customers, it is now being succeeded by the more advanced Dassault Rafale fighter.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including members of unions and immigrant rights groups, gathered on the 6th Street Bridge in downtown Los Angeles to demonstrate against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The rally called for an end to ICE raids, which participants say have instilled fear in communities and negatively impacted local businesses. Speakers, including local elected officials, condemned the administration's tactics as cruel and politically motivated, drawing parallels to past anti-immigrant campaigns in California. The march proceeded to the Japanese American National Museum, with participants demanding respect and dignity for immigrant communities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The act of queuing for hours has evolved from a mundane inconvenience into a celebrated social activity, particularly for product launches and store openings. The article explores this cultural shift, noting that people are drawn to the sense of community and camaraderie that forms while waiting in line with like-minded individuals. Psychologists attribute the appeal to the release of dopamine from the anticipation of a reward, especially for exclusive or hard-to-get items. Brands are leveraging this trend through "experiential marketing," turning queues into events with freebies, entertainment, and social media-worthy moments to engage consumers in a saturated market.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first-ever Black presiding bishop. This historic moment marks a significant step for the church as it seeks to become more inclusive. Rev. Curry, who grew up Catholic on Chicago's south side, will lead the 2.7 million-member denomination for a six-year term, succeeding the ELCA's first female presiding bishop. His installation is seen as a call for the church to better support its leaders of color and acknowledge the long-standing contributions of Black Lutherans in the U.S. and globally.</p>

          <p>Thousands of demonstrators, including several Members of the European Parliament, participated in a Pride march in the Hungarian city of Pecs, defying a police ban. The rally was held to protest the restrictive LGBTQ+ policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which passed a law earlier this year allowing such marches to be banned under the pretext of "protecting children." Protesters waved rainbow and EU flags, condemning the government's actions as an infringement on fundamental human rights. The event highlights the ongoing tension between Hungary's ultra-conservative government and advocates for civil liberties and LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

          <p>In a stunning turn of events, the previously 0-4 UCLA football team defeated No. 7 Penn State 42-37, securing a dramatic upset victory. The win came just days after a major coaching shake-up that saw tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel elevated to offensive play-caller. Under his new scheme, quarterback Nico Iamaleava had a career-best performance, accounting for five touchdowns (three rushing, two passing). The Bruins' aggressive game plan, which included a successful onside kick on the opening kickoff, allowed them to build an early lead and hold on for their first victory over a top-10 opponent since 2007.</p>

          <p>The article examines "freshers' flu," the common wave of illness that spreads among students at the start of the academic year. Immunologists explain it is not a single virus but an assortment of common colds that thrive when thousands of people from different areas mix in close quarters like lecture halls and dorms. The illness often feels worse than a typical cold because students' immune systems are compromised by stress, lack of sleep, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. While not typically serious, the combination of new viral exposures and a weakened immune response makes it a difficult rite of passage for many new university attendees to avoid.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from keeping unaccompanied immigrant children in custody after they turn 18. The policy would have seen these young adults transferred to adult ICE detention centers rather than being released to less restrictive settings like with relatives or foster families. The judge ruled that this practice violates a 2021 court order. This decision is another legal setback for the administration's controversial immigration policies, which advocates argue are causing chaos and harm to vulnerable young people.</p>
