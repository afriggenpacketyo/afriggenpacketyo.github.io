          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport. The plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and complex task of rerouting the M25 motorway. This proposal, named Heathrow West, aims to reduce risks and costs associated with the airport's own expansion plan. It marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the long-debated project, which has faced numerous delays due to costs, legal challenges, and environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug Mounjaro showed significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial comparing it to its older treatment, Trulicity. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause. While the results did not meet some analyst benchmarks for superiority, the company believes the data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for Type 2 diabetes patients with cardiovascular disease. The findings are seen as bolstering Lilly's position in the competitive diabetes and weight-loss drug market.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated his belief that "we have the makings of a deal" with China regarding trade, as a key tariff deadline approaches. While emphasizing that the agreement is not yet finalized and requires President Trump's approval, Bessent characterized recent negotiations as tough but productive. The two nations are in a temporary truce, having lowered retaliatory tariffs, with an August 12 deadline to reach a more permanent pact. The discussions come amid U.S. concerns over China's economic activities, including its purchases of Iranian oil and support for Russia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lightning flash that stretched 515 miles across the U.S. Great Plains in 2017 has been confirmed as a new world record by the World Meteorological Organization. The event, which extended from east Texas to near Kansas City, was documented using advanced space-based mapping technology from a new generation of orbital satellites. This technology allows scientists to observe lightning over much broader areas than was previously possible with ground-based sensors. The WMO also confirmed a new duration record of 17.1 seconds for a single flash over Uruguay and Argentina in 2020.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall vote targeting 24 opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers in Taiwan has failed, with none of the legislators losing their seats. The campaign, which was framed by the ruling party as a "resist China, protect Taiwan" battle, had raised concerns about escalating cross-strait tensions. Analysts suggest that the failure of the recall has averted a potential crisis, as a successful recall might have been interpreted by Beijing as a sign of rising anti-China sentiment, potentially leading to a more confrontational stance. The outcome provides temporary stability but leaves future political uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by a significant one-time gain from the sale of its Hulu stake. Revenue for its content and experiences division, including theme parks and film studios, saw healthy growth. However, the company continued to face challenges in its core connectivity business, losing 226,000 broadband customers amid heightened competition. Despite the subscriber loss, the company's mobile division showed strong performance, adding a record 378,000 new lines during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After both achieving massive success with their COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna and BioNTech are now pursuing different strategic paths, which has been reflected in their stock performance. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA vaccine pipeline, investing its windfall in developing more shots but facing high costs and a struggling stock. In contrast, BioNTech has used its profits to diversify through acquisitions, expanding into promising areas of cancer treatment and seeing its stock rise. This divergence highlights two distinct approaches to navigating the post-pandemic pharmaceutical landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter financial results that beat Wall Street estimates and raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, causing its shares to jump.

          <p>A scientific expedition in the northwest Pacific Ocean has discovered the deepest known life habitat on Earth, a thriving community of tubeworms and molluscs at depths of up to 9,500 meters. These organisms exist in complete darkness and obtain energy not from sunlight but through chemosynthesis, feeding on chemicals like methane that seep from tectonic faults. The discovery, published in the journal Nature, challenges existing models of life at extreme limits and suggests such chemosynthesis-based communities may be more widespread than previously thought. The finding provides new insights into carbon cycling in the deep ocean.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has announced she will not enter the race for governor of California, a decision that throws the contest wide open and leaves her own political future a subject of speculation. In her statement, she acknowledged that the Democratic party's "playbook" needs to change, signaling a potential new role in reshaping the party after its 2024 election loss. Allies suggest she will focus on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections and engaging with key voter blocs. By declining a gubernatorial run, Harris creates space to influence national policy and political debates without the constraints of a campaign.</p>
