          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, UK wage growth slowed to 4.7% in the three months to August, while unemployment marginally rose to 4.8%. The data suggests a stabilizing jobs market, with job vacancies falling for the 39th consecutive period. Analysts note that while private sector earnings growth is at a four-year low, it remains above inflation. Some economists believe persistent wage growth may delay Bank of England interest rate cuts, though an eventual easing is anticipated as the labor market loosens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the signing of a historic peace deal to end two years of conflict in Gaza, former President Donald Trump declined to endorse a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians. When questioned, he stated, "We’ll have to see," emphasizing his immediate focus is on rebuilding Gaza. The comments were made after a global peace summit in Egypt where a broad framework for Gaza's future was outlined. While the U.S.-brokered ceasefire has led to the release of 20 hostages, critical issues like postwar governance and Hamas's disarmament remain unresolved, leaving the peace process fragile.</p>

          <p>Google plans to invest $15 billion over the next five years to build a new artificial intelligence hub in Andhra Pradesh, India, which will be its largest outside the United States. Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian announced the project, which aims to develop a 1-gigawatt data center capacity across three campuses in Visakhapatnam. The significant investment reflects the surging global demand for cloud services and AI infrastructure. This move is part of Google's broader strategy to expand its global data center footprint, including a recent $25 billion commitment to enhance infrastructure in the U.S.</p>

The mission saw the Super Heavy booster separate and perform a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, while the Starship upper stage reached the edge of space before splashing down in the Indian Ocean. This flight was the final test before SpaceX introduces an upgraded prototype designed for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. The successful test marks another critical step for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship for its lunar landing missions.</p>

          <p>Shares of LG Electronics India surged over 45% in their market debut, resulting in the subsidiary's market capitalization briefly overtaking that of its South Korean parent company. The initial public offering was the most heavily subscribed major Indian IPO since 2008, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion. The IPO was priced at the top of its range, raising $1.3 billion for the parent company, which sold a portion of its stake. This successful listing highlights strong investor confidence in India's consumer electronics market, which is projected to nearly double in size by 2029.</p>

          <p>Dodgers relief pitcher Blake Treinen secured a crucial, albeit tense, save in a 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. After a difficult season marked by inconsistency, Treinen entered the game in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and managed to get the final out. The performance was a significant step forward for the pitcher, who was a key part of the Dodgers' World Series run last season but has struggled recently. His success provided a much-needed boost for the team's bullpen and demonstrated manager Dave Roberts' continued confidence in him.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. Cameron McGerr believes he might have been able to save his father, who died of a cardiac arrest, if he had been taught the life-saving skill earlier. He has already successfully persuaded his own school to introduce CPR lessons and has now taken his campaign, named Pulse of Life, to the Scottish Parliament. Health organizations support the initiative, noting that Scotland's low out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival rate could be improved with wider CPR knowledge.</p>

          <p>The recent ceasefire in Gaza and the accompanying exchange of hostages and prisoners dominated the front pages of British newspapers. Headlines like "Freed from hell" and "Two years of torment over" captured the emotional reunions of Israeli hostages with their families after more than 700 days in captivity. The coverage highlighted the joy felt by both Israelis and Palestinians but also noted the fragility of the peace. Some commentators praised Donald Trump's role in brokering the deal while cautioning that achieving a lasting peace will require sustained diplomatic effort beyond his presidency.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a national screening program for prostate cancer, arguing it is urgent, affordable, and would save lives. His push comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its previous decision against routine screening. A report from Prostate Cancer Research, for which Sunak is an ambassador, proposes a targeted program for high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men. While proponents point to more reliable testing with MRI scans, some medical experts remain cautious about over-diagnosis and unnecessary treatment.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Peking University have used artificial intelligence to digitally restore a 1,600-year-old masterpiece of Chinese calligraphy, "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess." The work, originally penned by 4th-century calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, had survived only in fragments, with just 250 of its 919 characters intact. By analyzing the stylistic traits of the surviving text, the research team trained an AI model to replicate the artist's unique style and generate the missing characters. The project successfully produced a complete scroll, showcasing the potential of AI to preserve and reconstruct ancient cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase blood donor numbers, particularly among young people, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will now encourage driving licence applicants to register. Emails sent after applications will contain a link to the NHS blood donor registry, a message expected to reach millions annually. Currently, over half of regular donors are over 45, and the NHS faces a persistent shortage, especially of O negative blood. This campaign hopes to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been included in licence applications since 1994.</p>

          <p>In the MLB playoffs, the Seattle Mariners took a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Toronto Blue Jays with a 10-3 victory in the AL Championship Series. The Blue Jays' offense has struggled, managing only four runs in two games, with star Vladimir Guerrero Jr. remaining hitless in the series. Meanwhile, in the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers won their NLCS opener against the Milwaukee Brewers with a close 2-1 victory. The Blue Jays now face a difficult challenge, as teams winning the first two road games in a best-of-seven series historically have a very high success rate.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS highlighted the significant advantage of their record-breaking $415-million payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a chaotic inning-ending double play, the Dodgers' talent prevailed. Key contributions came from highly-paid stars, including a go-ahead home run from Freddie Freeman and a dominant eight-inning performance from pitcher Blake Snell. The win demonstrates how the team's ability to acquire top-tier talent can overcome in-game adversity and the strategic efforts of a smaller-market opponent like the Brewers.</p>

Tina, 59, suffered a fall in 2018 that left her in a coma and with significant speech difficulties. Learning BSL has helped her communicate words she cannot say and has boosted her confidence. She and her husband participated in a BBC series with deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis, which explored how BSL could benefit older residents, and she has since earned a Level 1 qualification in the language.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts, though this was a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was driven by the construction and financial services sectors, while manufacturing output flattened. Despite the positive results, the Monetary Authority of Singapore held its policy settings steady, warning that GDP growth is expected to moderate in 2026 to a near-trend pace as global economic activity normalizes. The central bank also projects that core inflation will ease in the near term before gradually rising.</p>
