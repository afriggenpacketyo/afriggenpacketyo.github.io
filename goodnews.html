          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump has effectively triumphed over the liberal media, which the author claims tried to destroy his presidency. The piece cites the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of host Stephen Colbert, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post as evidence of Trump's success. It also credits his administration with a strong economy and decisive foreign policy, including forcing a beneficial trade deal with the EU. The author concludes that Trump's willingness to fight back against media claims, such as those of sexual assault, has led to a significant shift in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>Author Suleika Jaouad, in her new book "The Book of Alchemy," explores journaling as a transformative practice for navigating life's challenges. Having used journaling to cope with her leukemia diagnosis and the pandemic, she developed a method of reading passages from other writers' diaries to gain new perspectives. Jaouad suggests that consistency is key for new journalers, recommending they integrate the practice into a daily routine, like a morning coffee. She emphasizes that there is no right or wrong way to journal, and the goal is to use writing to process experiences and find a path back to oneself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Microsoft report on the occupational impact of generative AI has identified blue-collar and hands-on professions as the most secure from artificial intelligence disruption. Researchers analyzed user interactions with Microsoft's Copilot and found that roles involving physical work, such as painters, nursing assistants, and automotive repairers, were least likely to seek AI assistance. Conversely, white-collar jobs like translators, writers, and historians were at the highest risk. The findings suggest that skills in physical trades are becoming more stable as AI transforms knowledge-based work, shrinking the skills premium for many desk jobs.</p>

          <p>This article provides a narrative analysis of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson's role as a "domestique," or support rider, for his team during the Tour de France. Despite his own ambitions and suffering from bronchitis, Jorgenson repeatedly exhausted himself in selfless efforts to support team leader Jonas Vingegaard against the dominant Tadej Pogačar. While his primary mission to help Vingegaard win failed, his persistent attacks on the final stage ultimately drained Pogačar enough to allow teammate Wout van Aert to secure a prestigious stage victory. Jorgenson's story is presented as a triumph of teamwork and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have finalized a trade agreement that includes US assistance in developing Pakistan's substantial oil reserves. President Donald Trump announced the deal, which he said will involve choosing a U.S. oil company to lead the partnership. In return, Pakistan confirmed it will receive lower tariffs on its exports to the U.S., avoiding a potential 29% levy. The announcement came shortly after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on India, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs and its trade with Russia, suggesting Pakistan might one day sell oil to its regional rival.

          <p>Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia, are expressing interest in China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet as an alternative to Airbus and Boeing. According to Malaysia's transport minister, the growing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia, combined with long delivery backlogs from the two dominant manufacturers, is driving this interest. China is actively promoting its Comac-built C919 narrowbody airliner as a more readily available and cheaper option. This shift indicates a potential opening for China to gain a foothold in the highly competitive global aviation market.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has facilitated the return of the sacred Piprahwa Gems to India following significant pressure from the Indian government and Buddhist leaders worldwide. The jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, were acquired by the Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group and will now be placed on permanent public display. The planned auction in Hong Kong had sparked an ethical debate over whether such sacred relics should be treated as commodities. The gems were originally unearthed in 1898 from a stupa in northern India and had remained in a private British collection for over a century.</p>
