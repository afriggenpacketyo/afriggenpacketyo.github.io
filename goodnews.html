        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Comcast has announced that Versant will be the name of its spun-off NBCUniversal cable network portfolio. CEO Mark Lazarus stated the name was chosen to highlight the company's versatility and broad subject knowledge, and that Versant will include networks such as USA, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel, as well as digital assets like Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. Versant is expected to spin out from Comcast before the end of 2025, with assets generating around $7 billion in revenue last year. The corporate strategy will focus on individual brand interaction with users rather than the holding company itself.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney affirmed to President Trump that Canada would never be for sale or join the United States. Trump, despite previously suggesting Canada could become the 51st state, praised Carney as a talented leader. The leaders also discussed trade relations, with Trump suggesting the USMCA trade agreement could be renegotiated and asserting that Canada needs to "take care of itself economically". Carney's Liberal Party recently won the Canadian election on a platform of defending against Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump stated that the U.S. would cease attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, claiming the group had "capitulated" and no longer wanted to fight. This announcement coincided with Oman confirming a "ceasefire" agreement with the Iran-backed group to halt attacks on Red Sea shipping. The Houthis began targeting shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, prompting retaliatory strikes from the U.S. The US military says it has struck 1,000 targets in Yemen since March. In response, Israel has launched attacks on Yemen's main international airport in Sanaa, leaving it "completely destroyed".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>If a debt collector rejects a settlement offer, it doesn't necessarily mean you're out of options. The rejection could be due to the offer being too low, the debt being too fresh, or the collector believing you can pay more. Strategies to improve the chances of settling include doing your homework, offering proof of hardship, working with a debt relief expert, and being patient but persistent. Debt collectors aren't legally required to settle accounts for less than what's owed, so it's important to have a plan.</p>
