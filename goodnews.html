        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses how George Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently affected John Boehner's early congressional campaign. Wendt, campaigning for his brother-in-law Greg Jolivette, mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a scandal during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show." Although Boehner's campaign responded, Wendt later apologized, and Boehner still won the election. The article also provides background on the political landscape of Ohio's 8th Congressional District at the time, including the scandal involving Buz Lukens and the challenge posed by Tom Kindness.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but corrected the figure after consulting with a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers worked to recover the hives and ensure the bees returned to them. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the recovery efforts, and most bees were expected to be back in their hives by the following morning.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital flight to the edge of space from its West Texas launch site. The New Shepard rocket carried an international crew, including passengers from Panama, Canada, and New Zealand, to an altitude of nearly 65 miles, providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and views of space. The reusable booster returned to a landing pad near the launch site, while the capsule descended under parachutes for a soft landing in the desert. This marked Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight, bringing the total number of people launched by the company to 68.</p>

          <p>Wayfarers Chapel, a historic landmark in Rancho Palos Verdes, is seeking a new location due to landslides that have forced its disassembly. Chapel leaders are hoping to relocate to a site next to Rancho Palos Verdes City Hall on the old Battery Barnes military site. The new site would include a visitor's center, museum, cafe, and gardens, while maintaining ocean views. The chapel, designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Jr., was built in 1951, but has been battered by recent landslides, making rebuilding in the same location impossible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ross Douthat, Donald Trump's political resilience stems from his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself. This adaptability reassures swing voters that any extreme actions are provisional and that Trump is generally willing to pull back. Recent shifts in Trump's policies, such as easing China tariffs and distancing from Elon Musk, have improved his poll numbers. This suggests that voters expect Trump to check himself and be checked by others, approving of his pressure on institutions they distrust, contingent on his acceptance of counterpressure.</p>
