          <p>At a summit in Beijing, China offered Latin American and Caribbean countries a $9.2 billion credit line denominated in yuan. This move is aimed at increasing the international use of the Chinese currency and strengthening China's strategic ties in the region. President Xi Jinping also announced a visa-free policy for select Latin American nations, with plans to expand it. China has become a major trading partner for several Latin American countries, surpassing the U.S. in some cases, and many have joined the Belt and Road Initiative.</p>

          <p>President Trump commenced a four-day tour of the Gulf states, starting in Saudi Arabia, with the goal of securing business deals worth over $1 trillion. The agreements are expected to encompass investments in artificial intelligence, energy, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is anticipated to spend considerable time with President Trump, potentially echoing the strategies used in 2017 to foster a positive relationship. The trip is under scrutiny due to the Trump family's pending deals with Saudi-owned firms, a UAE-affiliated cryptocurrency venture, and a Qatari-backed golf project.</p>

          <p>Financial technology firms, which benefited from higher interest rates in recent years, now face a challenge as rates decline. Higher rates boosted net interest income for fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo, but falling rates raise doubts about the sustainability of this income. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees. Diversification and strong monetization of customer base are key to weathering changes in the economy.</p>
