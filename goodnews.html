          <p>Ford Motor is introducing special financing for F-150 pickup truck buyers with subprime credit scores (below 620 FICO) to boost sales before the third quarter ends. This initiative offers lower interest rates typically reserved for higher-credit individuals, despite the increased risk of default during economic downturns. Ford Credit states it uses proprietary models to assess creditworthiness beyond FICO, ensuring only creditworthy customers are financed. This move comes as new auto loan rates remain high and the Federal Reserve recently cut its interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration aims to create a cash buffer and reduce taxpayer risk, marking a direct ownership interest in the mineral supply chain.

Once a vibrant counterculture hub with improvised dwellings, the area has been redeveloped with luxury apartments, hotels, and corporate structures, displacing alternative communities. Cultural historian Anna von Arnim-Rosenthal notes the shift from a wasteland to a tourist hotspot, highlighting protests against developer Philip Anschutz's projects. Despite the changes, the gallery maintains its original spirit of freedom, art, and remembrance, reinterpreting the Wall's historical significance.</p>

Trump, who likened Russia to a "paper tiger," also urged NATO members to shoot down Russian jets entering their airspace. European defense firms like Renk, Leonardo, and Saab saw their shares climb.

Experts advise strengthening credit profiles and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the best rates. The article suggests that a potential pause in Fed rate hikes could stabilize or lower rates, benefiting borrowers.

          <p>The remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," a woman found dead in 1946, were exhumed in Oregon as authorities aim to solve the state's oldest unidentified person case. The victim, believed to be 30-50 years old, suffered blunt-force trauma and was dismembered. Critical evidence vanished in the 1950s, halting previous investigations. Advanced forensic testing will now be conducted on the degraded remains, which were located in Mountain View Cemetery. Officials hope this new effort will finally identify her and bring resolution to the nearly 80-year-old cold case.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) announced the arrest of a suspect in southern England in connection with recent cyberattacks that disrupted air travel at several major European airports, including London Heathrow, Dublin, Brussels, and Berlin. The attacks, attributed to "third-party ransomware" affecting Collins Aerospace software, forced manual check-ins and baggage drops, causing significant delays and cancellations. While the investigation is in its early stages, the arrest marks a positive step in addressing the persistent global threat of cybercrime and its disruptive impact on critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Mortgage demand saw a slight increase of 0.6% last week, stalling after a significant 58% surge in refinance activity the prior week, despite interest rates falling further. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.34%, the lowest since September 2024. Refinance applications rose by 1%, driven by government loans, while purchase applications remained flat. This trend follows a period of high volatility in rates, influenced by Federal Reserve decisions. Experts note that while homebuyer demand is strong for the season, the market remains sensitive to rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirement experts advise seniors to plan for significant expenses like rising healthcare and long-term care costs, housing, and unexpected taxes. Healthcare costs, increasing by 8.5% annually, can still be substantial even with Medicare. Long-term care, such as nursing homes, can cost over $9,000 monthly, making insurance crucial. Housing expenses, including rising home insurance and HOA fees, also demand budgeting. Additionally, retirees may face surprising tax burdens from Social Security benefits, retirement account withdrawals, and capital gains. Experts stress the importance of early and strategic financial planning for a secure retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated the league could begin renegotiating its media rights deals as early as 2026, four years ahead of the current opt-out clause. This move, potentially adding billions to the NFL's revenue, requires agreement from current partners like Disney, Comcast, and Amazon. Goodell acknowledged that other leagues' recent deals suggest the NFL is leaving money on the table, indicating a desire to capitalize on the changing media landscape and the high value of live sports content. Early renegotiations could impact future salary caps and team valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Astronomers have detected a black hole collision, GW250114, with unprecedented clarity, confirming long-held predictions by Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. Using the upgraded LIGO observatory, scientists observed two black holes merging, with the resulting "ringing" confirming Kerr's 1963 prediction that black holes are described by only two numbers: mass and rotation. The observation also strongly validated Hawking's 1971 theorem that a merged black hole's surface area must be equal to or greater than the sum of its predecessors. This milestone revolutionizes understanding of space-time and gravity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To find trustworthy financial advice, individuals should ask prospective advisors if they are a fiduciary. A fiduciary has a legal duty to act in the client's best interest, unlike those adhering only to a "suitability" standard, which merely requires appropriate, not necessarily optimal, recommendations. Experts warn that non-fiduciary advice can lead to high-cost investments or products benefiting the advisor. Fiduciaries must disclose conflicts of interest and how they are compensated. Consumers can verify an advisor's fiduciary status through the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure site or organizations like the CFP Board. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-Myung is advocating for constitutional reforms to allow future presidents to serve two consecutive four-year terms, replacing the current single five-year limit. This initiative aims to synchronize presidential and National Assembly elections, promoting policy continuity and greater accountability. While many past presidents have favored such changes, Lee faces challenges in securing the required two-thirds parliamentary majority and public referendum approval, especially given opposition to other proposed amendments concerning sexual minorities' rights and North Korea. Polls indicate over 60% public support for these comprehensive reforms.</p>
