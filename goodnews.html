          <p>Walmart announced plans to extend its drone delivery service to 100 stores across Atlanta, Charlotte, Houston, Orlando, and Tampa within the next year, adding Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas to the existing service in Arkansas and Florida. Customers can order through the Wing app, with deliveries taking 30 minutes or less within a six-mile radius of the store. The retailer aims to compete with rivals like Amazon by offering convenience alongside low prices, with frequently delivered items including eggs, ice cream, and pet food. This expansion follows a previous attempt to expand drone deliveries in 2022 that did not achieve its goals, and Walmart has completed over 150,000 drone deliveries since 2021.</p>

          <p>The government has introduced new regulations prohibiting six water companies from awarding "unfair" bonuses to senior executives. The ban applies to firms that fail to meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have been convicted of criminal offenses. The move comes amid growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, with water companies having paid out ¬£112m in executive rewards over the past decade. The affected companies include Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water. Regulator Ofwat can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, but critics argue that companies could circumvent the ban by increasing base salaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece discusses the need for improved diplomatic relations between the Philippines and China, despite ongoing maritime disputes. The article argues that an overemphasis on the sea dispute has hindered broader connections, including economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges. It suggests that both Manila and Beijing should explore areas of collaboration without compromising their positions, such as economic development, tourism, and renewable energy. By focusing solely on security issues, the relationship risks becoming a dangerous, self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
