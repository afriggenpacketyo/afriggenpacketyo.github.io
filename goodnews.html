        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur, named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, in a Mongolian museum collection, which they say significantly alters the understanding of tyrannosaur evolution. The 86-million-year-old skeletons represent the closest known ancestor to all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. This discovery bridges the gap between smaller, fleet-footed predators of the Jurassic period and the formidable giants that dominated North America and Asia. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of key features, such as skull anatomy, that contributed to the tyrannosaurs' powerful jaws.</p>
