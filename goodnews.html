          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced the implementation of artificial intelligence to identify and address air traffic risks, following recent near-misses and fatal plane crashes. The AI will analyze potential hot spots nationwide to prevent tragedies, such as the midair collision at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. This initiative is part of a broader plan to build a new state-of-the-art traffic control system with better technology to reduce outages and improve safety. The Department of Transportation aims to take action before tragedies occur, but details on how hot spots are identified and specific safety concerns addressed by the AI remain unclear.</p>

Harrison Tyler co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company, and was dedicated to preserving Sherwood Forest, President Tyler's home, and Fort Pocahontas, a Civil War fortification nearby.

          <p>Nvidia's shares surged after reporting better-than-expected quarterly revenue and earnings, driven by the AI chipmaker's robust performance. The company's fiscal 2026 first-quarter revenue increased 69% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share increased 57%. CEO Jensen Huang cited advancements in reasoning AI, the rescinding of AI diffusion rules, the development of enterprise AI agents, and industrial AI as positive surprises driving demand. The price target has been raised to $170 from $165, though a hold-equivalent rating remains due to the stock's recent rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Missouri town, overwhelmingly supportive of President Trump, is now confronting the consequences of his immigration policies after the detention of Carol Hui, a long-time resident facing deportation. Hui, who immigrated from Hong Kong 20 years ago, is well-known and loved in Kennett, Missouri, where she works as a waitress. Her detention has sparked debate among residents, some of whom question how to reconcile their support for Trump with their desire to help Carol. While some view her deportation as a necessary enforcement of immigration laws, others express outrage at the separation of a hardworking mother from her family.</p>

          <p>The government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. This change could make it easier for millions of homes in England to install heat pumps, but consumer groups warn that it won't help renters or those in leasehold properties. The biggest barrier remains the high upfront costs, particularly for older housing stock requiring upgrades to pipework and insulation. This is part of the government's Warm Homes Plan to lower household bills and cut planet-warming emissions.</p>
