          <p>China's humanoid robot market is gaining significant momentum as state-owned telecommunications giant China Mobile placed a US$17.3 million order with start-ups AgiBot and Unitree Robotics. This two-year deal reflects the Chinese government's strategy to boost demand for advanced robotics within state-owned enterprises, aligning with its goal to make humanoids a transformative technology. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has identified humanoid robots as a key innovation, expected to reshape industrial landscapes and daily life. This move underscores China's ambition to lead in artificial intelligence and robotics.</p>

          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to compete with the dominant Uncrustables brand. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams differentiates itself by targeting health-conscious consumers, offering a product with no seed oils, artificial additives, or high-fructose corn syrup, and a higher protein content. Despite a higher price point, Jams is betting on the appeal to athletes and those seeking cleaner ingredients to capture a share of the billion-dollar market. The product is launching exclusively in 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Overview of Queerness Across Different Cultures and Eras</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 07:39:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a brief world history of queerness, exploring how different societies have viewed non-binary gender identities and same-sex relationships through the ages. It contrasts the relative acceptance in antiquity, citing examples like the Roman Emperor Hadrian and the poet Sappho, with the persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which used biblical stories to stigmatize such behaviors. The article also touches on the acceptance of same-sex love in other cultures, such as among Japanese samurai, and highlights historical LGBTQ+ figures who sought to live authentically. It concludes by noting the progress made in modern times while emphasizing the need to protect these hard-won freedoms.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Considers Employee-Owned Mutual Model for Post Office</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 07:37:31 EDT</div>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This proposal comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters wrongly convicted, prompting calls for a significant cultural overhaul. Proponents argue that a mutual model, where staff have a greater stake in decision-making, could prevent such scandals from recurring. The consultation will also examine the number of required branches and the range of services, particularly banking, that the Post Office should offer in the future.</p>

          <p>A military canine named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving dozens of lives by detecting a bomb planted by guerrilla fighters. During a reconnaissance mission in the Antioquia region, the bomb detonated, shattering one of Sanson's legs but preventing harm to 36 soldiers and numerous civilians who use the path daily. The dog's leg had to be amputated, and he is now recovering. The Colombian military, which blamed the National Liberation Army (ELN) for the attack, stated that Sanson's actions protected the entire community from a grave threat.</p>

          <h2>The Pro-Housing YIMBY Movement is a Progressive, Not Centrist, Cause</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 07:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for building more housing to increase affordability, is fundamentally a progressive and populist effort, contrary to critics who label it as centrist or pro-business. The author frames the issue in antitrust terms, asserting that NIMBYism represents a form of regulatory capture by wealthy landowners who restrict housing supply to protect their property values. By fighting against exclusionary zoning and other restrictive regulations, the YIMBY movement aims to break this cartel-like hold on the housing market. This approach seeks to unrig the system, expand access, and redistribute wealth from a landowning elite to the broader population.</p>

Accompanied by veteran American astronaut Peggy Whitson, the crew undocked from the ISS in a SpaceX capsule, concluding a trip that marked the first time in over four decades that these nations had citizens in orbit. During their stay, the astronauts conducted numerous scientific experiments and engaged in outreach with their home countries. The mission, chartered by Axiom Space, underscores the growing role of commercial enterprise in human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, who recently won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, has centered his campaign on affordability, with a proposal for free, universal childcare gaining significant attention. This policy, aimed at children from six weeks old, responds to a surge in activism highlighting the city's childcare crisis, where annual costs can exceed $26,000. Mamdani plans to fund the program by increasing taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Proponents argue the policy would provide financial relief to families, boost the economy, and improve equity, signaling that childcare affordability is becoming a key winning issue in urban politics.</p>

          <p>China and Serbia are set to hold their first joint military training exercise this month, marking a deepening of defense cooperation between Beijing and the Balkan nation. The exercise aims to enhance the combat skills of the participating forces and strengthen military ties. Serbia, which is not a member of NATO, is one of China's closest European partners, a relationship strengthened since the 1999 NATO bombing of the former Yugoslavia. This drill represents China's first joint exercise with a European country since its counterterrorism training with Belarus last year, signaling its growing military diplomacy in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate fell to a lower-than-expected 2.1% in June, continuing a downward trend and reaching a more than six-year low. The drop was primarily driven by a continued decline in food price growth, with food inflation turning negative. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its monetary policy relaxation, potentially leading to further interest rate cuts. Strong agricultural production and favorable weather are expected to keep food prices in check, which could help boost domestic consumption and support economic growth.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, breaking the $120,000 mark, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This rally is also buoyed by anticipation of clearer regulatory frameworks from the U.S. Congress during the upcoming 'Crypto Week,' which could further boost investor confidence. Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying is a key factor behind the cryptocurrency's recent momentum, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future. The market is also watching for potential impacts from U.S. trade policy and Federal Reserve decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
