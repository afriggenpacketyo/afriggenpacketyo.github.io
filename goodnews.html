          <p>Hong Kong is actively seeking to attract high-spending tourists to rejuvenate its economy, which has been affected by protests, pandemic restrictions, and security crackdowns.

          <p>European leaders are increasingly advocating for the European Union to become more self-reliant, aiming to reduce dependencies on the United States for defense and technology, China for raw materials and cleantech goods, and Russia for energy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron have emphasized the need for Europe to shape the new international order and achieve strategic autonomy. The EU has sought economic concessions from Beijing, but the consensus in Brussels is that China has not reciprocated, further driving the push for European independence. This move reflects a desire for greater control over its future and a more prominent role in global affairs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement, paving the way for US colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports history. The agreement allows each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and allocates $2.7 billion to former players barred from revenue for years. This decision is expected to professionalize college athletics, with high-stakes recruitment and potential program cuts. The ruling brings substantial changes to the NCAA's landscape, impacting nearly 500,000 athletes across 1,100 member schools.</p>

This landmark decision signifies a major shift in college sports, driven by the exponential growth of revenue in the industry. The new system allows schools to compensate players, primarily in football and basketball, while also addressing concerns about name, image, and likeness deals through a third-party clearinghouse.</p>
