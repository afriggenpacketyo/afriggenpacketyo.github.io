          <p>American Express reported a 7% jump in total card spending for the second quarter, indicating that its affluent customer base continues to spend freely on goods and services. However, the company noted a significant exception, with spending on domestic economy-class airfare remaining flat compared to the previous year. This weakness in a key travel sector, combined with increased competition and reward program costs, has raised some investor concerns despite strong overall performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an International Chamber of Commerce panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. While the decision is a significant strategic victory for Chevron, the company's CEO indicated that some job reductions are expected as the two entities integrate.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings of placing $20,000 into either a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current rate environment. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, which could yield more interest over time, their rates are subject to change. In contrast, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return, which may offer more security and potentially higher long-term earnings for savers concerned about future rate decreases.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Texas Roadhouse have recently underperformed due to accelerating beef inflation, a significant cost for the steakhouse chain. Beef prices rose about 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, creating pressure on the company's operating margins. Despite this headwind, some analysts have raised their price targets, citing the company's strong customer traffic and continued market share gains in the full-service steak category, suggesting long-term confidence in the business.

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, claims to have solved the historical mystery of the two young princes who disappeared from the Tower of London. Contrary to the popular narrative that they were murdered by their uncle, Richard III, Langley's decade-long "Missing Princes Project" has reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting both princes survived. Her new book argues that the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda, a thesis that has been met with a mix of interest and skepticism from historians.</p>

          <p>Over 40 years after his girlfriend's disappearance, a 72-year-old man has been arrested and extradited to Oregon to face a murder charge. Mark Sanfratello is accused of killing 27-year-old Teresa Peroni, who was last seen with him at a party in July 1983. The cold case was reopened in 2024, and investigators used new DNA evidence and modern forensic testing to identify a skull found in 1997 as Peroni's, leading to a grand jury indictment against Sanfratello.</p>

          <p>The annual royal "swan upping" survey on the River Thames has found an increase in the number of young swans, signaling a potential recovery for the population. This year's five-day count found 115 cygnets, up from 86 last year, offering a hopeful sign after a 45% decline over the past two years due to avian flu and human attacks. The centuries-old tradition, which now focuses on conservation, involves weighing and checking the health of young swans along a stretch of the river.</p>

          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers shows that Americans' fears about future inflation have significantly decreased, with expectations falling to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped to 4.4% in July from 5% in June, while the five-year outlook also declined. This suggests that while consumers still perceive some risk, they believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary, an encouraging sign for the Federal Reserve.

          <p>For retirees on a fixed Social Security income, managing credit card debt can be particularly challenging, but relief options are available. This article explains that while Social Security income is protected from creditors, eligibility for programs like debt management, settlement, or consolidation depends on one's overall financial situation.

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of major carrier profits last year. Analysts attribute their success to extensive international networks and a strong focus on premium travelers, which has helped them weather challenges like falling domestic airfares. Both airlines have seen robust revenue from premium cabins and loyalty programs, allowing them to maintain stronger margins while competitors struggle with overcapacity in the coach-class market.
