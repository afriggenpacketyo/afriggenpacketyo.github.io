          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to overturn an $83.3 million jury verdict for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court affirmed that the damages were fair and reasonable, dismissing Trump's arguments about excessive penalties and presidential immunity. This ruling pertains to defamatory statements Trump made in 2019 after Carroll accused him of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s. The decision marks another significant legal setback for the former president in the long-running dispute, with Carroll's legal team stating they look forward to justice finally being done.</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's departure, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has called for her replacement to be a woman from outside of London. She argued that this would help broaden the party's leadership appeal and complement Sir Keir Starmer. The party has initiated an accelerated election process, with nominations opening this week and a winner to be announced in late October. The contest is seen as a pivotal moment for the party's direction, with several high-profile figures, including Dame Emily Thornberry, considering a bid for the position.</p>

          <p>European stock markets closed higher on Monday, with investors closely monitoring political developments in France. French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou is facing a critical confidence vote he initiated himself amid disputes over significant budget cuts. If Bayrou loses the vote, it would force President Emmanuel Macron to appoint a fifth prime minister in under two years, signaling continued political instability. Despite this uncertainty, major indices like France's CAC 40 and Germany's DAX saw gains, driven by retail and technology stocks, as markets also anticipated key U.S. inflation data.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James has written an essay for China's state-run People's Daily, expressing gratitude to his Chinese fans. The move comes nearly six years after a tweet from then-Rockets GM Daryl Morey supporting Hong Kong protesters created a major rift between the NBA and Beijing. At the time, James had criticized Morey for being "misinformed." His recent essay, published at the conclusion of a promotional tour in Asia, is seen as a sign of the continuously improving relationship between the NBA and China, with games now regularly broadcast in the country again.</p>

          <p>The BBC has announced that food critic Grace Dent and chef Anna Haugh will be the new hosts of the popular cooking competition show 'MasterChef.' They are set to replace long-time hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode, who were removed from the program in July following a report that upheld claims made against them. Dent, a regular guest on the show, and Haugh, a judge on the 'Professionals' spin-off, will take the helm of the flagship series. This significant change marks the end of a 20-year era for the show's original hosting duo.</p>

          <p>Musician Roger Blevins Jr., frontman for the band Mingo Fishtrap, is back on stage after a life-altering battle with tongue cancer. Diagnosed in 2022, he underwent surgery to remove most of his tongue, which was then reconstructed with tissue from his thigh. After intensive rehabilitation to learn to speak and sing again, Blevins has made a remarkable recovery and recently performed his first ticketed show since the surgery. Inspired by his experience, he and his wife have launched a nonprofit called "The Tough Crowd Project" to provide financial and other support to families affected by cancer.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood jumped over 14% after S&P Global announced it will be added to the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This long-anticipated inclusion is a significant milestone for the company, which has seen its stock price triple in 2025. Inclusion in the benchmark index typically triggers substantial buying from passive funds that track the S&P 500, potentially driving billions of dollars in trading. The move reflects a major turnaround for the company, which struggled after its 2021 IPO but has since benefited from increased interest in cryptocurrency trading.</p>

The mural's appearance follows recent mass arrests at a protest, leading to speculation that it is a commentary on the right to protest and the legal system.

          <p>With the U.S. job market showing signs of slowing, financial experts are advising student loan borrowers on how to manage their debt if they become unemployed. Key options for federal loan holders include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly payments to as little as $0 based on income, including unemployment benefits. Borrowers may also qualify for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment, which allows them to temporarily pause payments. These strategies can provide critical financial relief for those struggling to find work in the current economic climate.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnivirakul, a conservative political veteran and leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, has been elected as Thailand's new prime minister. His appointment follows the court-ordered removal of his predecessor and was secured with the surprising support of the main opposition People's Party. The opposition agreed to back Anutin on the condition that he dissolves parliament and calls for new elections within four months. Anutin, who previously served as health minister and oversaw the legalization of cannabis, now faces the challenge of leading a minority government amid political turmoil and a sluggish economy.</p>

          <p>With interest rates and living costs high, many homeowners are considering tapping into their substantial home equity.

Conversely, they warn against risky uses like speculative investing in volatile markets or paying off credit cards only to run up new balances.

This phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the lunar surface. The moon takes on a reddish hue because the only sunlight reaching it is filtered through Earth's atmosphere, which scatters blue light. Photos from around the globe captured the event's striking red glow. The next total lunar eclipse will be visible from the Americas in March.</p>
