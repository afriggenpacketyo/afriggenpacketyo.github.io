          <h2>Nashville Mayor Criticizes ICE Arrests of Criminals as Not Focused on Public Safety</h2>

          <p>Following ICE operations in Nashville that led to the arrest of a convicted child sexual assault perpetrator and an alleged gang member, Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell expressed concern that these actions are not focused on making the city safer. O'Connell emphasized that the city's police department does not participate in federal immigration enforcement and lacks access to federal immigration databases. DHS responded by asserting that the Nashville Mayor should want these criminal illegal aliens off American streets, and that the American people voted for President Trump's immigration enforcement. ICE recently announced a high number of arrests and removals of illegal immigrants during President Trump‚Äôs first 100 days of his second term.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio in an effort to shore up economic growth amidst ongoing trade worries. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting liquidity into the market. This announcement comes as Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is set to hold talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to discuss tariff and trade matters, potentially marking a turning point in the trade war between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Met Gala appearances of Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh sparked disappointment among South Asian fans, who felt the stars were not given due recognition. Khan, who has a global following, was seemingly unrecognized by Vogue livestream co-hosts, while Dosanjh was quickly panned away from on the red carpet.

          <p>A French technology developed by Yves Ocello from IB2 is set to transform China's aluminium industry by enabling the use of low-grade bauxite, previously unusable due to its high silica content. The process neutralizes silica and sulphur, making it possible to refine high-silica bauxite using the Bayer method. This could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia. IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum in 2023 to implement the technology.</p>

Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two countries, and asked Trump to stop calling Canada the 51st state. Trump has imposed a 25% import tariff on goods from Canada, leading to strained relations between the two countries.</p>

Therrien's strategy involves navigating Yiwu‚Äôs small-commodities market in China to find suppliers directly, potentially leading to a more sustainable and cost-efficient supply chain.
