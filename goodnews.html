          <p>After years of index fund dominance, active management is experiencing a resurgence in the ETF market, as demonstrated by recent inflows into actively managed equity ETFs. Investors are seeking unique approaches to navigate market volatility, with a focus on funds that offer income, downside protection, or buffered strategies. This shift is driven by macro trends, the rise of younger retail investors, and concerns about volatility in the bond market. Experts suggest investors should remain invested during market swings and identify funds with a unique investment approach rather than engaging in panic trading, but also remember that passive funds are still a large share of the overall market.

The film's success is attributed to positive reviews and audience reception, signaling a potential turnaround for Marvel after inconsistent performance in recent years. Box office analysts note that this is a strong performance considering the ensemble cast of lesser-known characters, indicating Marvel's capability when its creative engine is firing on all cylinders.

The group was also spreading hate speech targeting children, adolescents, and the LGBTQIA+ community. The concert was part of Rio's effort to revitalize its economy, deploying 5,000 officers and using drones and facial recognition for security, as Lady Gaga performed Brazil-themed acts for an emotional crowd.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he is not considering running for a third presidential term, despite previous suggestions and the sale of "Trump 2028" merchandise. In an interview, Trump acknowledged the constitutional limitations preventing him from seeking a third term and mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors. He also addressed criticisms of his economic policies, particularly his tariff plan, describing it as a "transition period" and defending his administration's handling of the economy, though he did say that Americans may have fewer goods for sale in shops as the trade war continues.</p>

          <p>The South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company has been formally organized as the city of Starbase after a vote by residents. The vote passed with a large majority, and Musk celebrated the decision. Starbase serves as the facility and launch site for SpaceX's rocket program, and the creation of an official company town has drawn both support and criticism. Critics worry about Musk's increased control over the area and the potential authority to close a popular beach for launches, as SpaceX seeks to increase the number of launches from the site.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Texan town voted in favor of renaming the town 'Starbase', which is home to Elon Musk's SpaceX company. The move separates the town from Cameron County, which previously rejected plans to build more housing for SpaceX employees. Starbase will now be able to approve construction projects itself, but some are unhappy with the new status and voiced concern over the environmental impact and warned of more destruction. The changed city status allows Starbase to control building and permitting processes and avoid other regulatory red-tape, while collecting taxes and writing local law.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Mark Whitaker's new book, "The Afterlife of Malcolm X," focuses on the artistic choices made by Spike Lee and Denzel Washington in their 1992 biopic. The excerpt details the recreation of Malcolm Little's life, from his days as a street hustler to his role as a leader in the civil rights movement. The book examines the film's climactic assassination scene, including the use of dialogue, music, and camera work to convey Malcolm's premonition of his death, and underscores Lee's thesis about Malcolm's fatalistic state of mind.</p>

          <p>This month marks the 100th birthday of Malcolm X, the charismatic Black leader known for his blunt talk and biting humor. Over the years, Malcolm X has inspired leaders of the Black Power and Black Arts movements, activist athletes, and hip hop artists. His message of self-defense, Black pride, and cultural assertion still resonates in today's political climate. Historians compare Malcolm to Martin Luther King Jr., noting that the differences between them were really about how they conceptualized freedom for Black people.</p>

          <p>A psychologist who studies couples identifies the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" as highly damaging to relationships, leading to insecurity and questioning of worth. This comparison implies that the partner is not enough and that someone else could do a better job, stemming from a deeper issue of not feeling safe enough to voice needs plainly. Research suggests that partners who feel uncertain about the relationship are more likely to hold back, leading to the use of such phrases instead of direct communication. The key to a healthy relationship is clear, shame-free communication of needs without comparison.</p>

Many people are generally happy with their jobs and understand the pressures employers face, recognizing that work is work and the perfect job doesn't exist.
