          <p>Britain's Shell announced better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a challenging market of lower global oil and gas prices. The energy giant maintained its pace of shareholder returns, declaring another $3.5 billion in share buybacks, marking the 15th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in buybacks. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the company's performance and strategic transformation, noting Shell's shares have outperformed many European and U.S. rivals this year. This financial stability underscores the company's robust operational discipline. (not investment advice)</p>

Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ishaq Dar, confirmed the deal, anticipating lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the US. While specific details regarding tariff rates and the oil reserves remain unclarified, the agreement follows a 90-day suspension of a potential 29% US tariff on Pakistan. Trump also hinted at future oil sales from Pakistan to India, a country he recently imposed a 25% tariff on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke revealed that several Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new Air Borneo, are expressing interest in China's C919 passenger jet. This growing interest is primarily driven by the increasing demand for air travel in Southeast Asia and the significant delivery delays experienced with aircraft orders from established manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. China's Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) is actively promoting the C919 as a more affordable and readily available alternative, offering airlines a viable option to diversify their fleets and meet operational needs more quickly.</p>

          <p>Canada and Malta have declared their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine in September, joining France and the United Kingdom in a concerted international effort. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney specified that Canada's recognition is predicated on the Palestinian Authority holding general elections in 2026 and demilitarizing the Palestinian state. Malta's permanent secretary, Christopher Cutajar, emphasized that this recognition is not merely symbolic but a concrete step towards achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East. Israel, which opposes a two-state solution, is boycotting the upcoming UN General Assembly meeting where these announcements are expected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has introduced a groundbreaking national ban on social media for youth, framed as a response to a growing mental health crisis among teenagers. The legislation, set to commence in December, will impose fines on platforms like TikTok and Facebook if they fail to prevent underage users from accessing their services. Despite overwhelming public support for the ban, some experts express skepticism about its effectiveness, citing limited empirical evidence for a direct causal link between social media use and declining youth mental health. Critics also warn of potential unintended consequences, such as pushing young users to less regulated online environments.</p>

The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the gems, which will now be permanently displayed in India, a move hailed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a proud moment for the nation's cultural heritage.</p>
