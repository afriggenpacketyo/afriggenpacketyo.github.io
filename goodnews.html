        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, which has been severely impacted by a cyber attack in late August. The attack forced JLR to suspend production for weeks, raising concerns that many small suppliers could face bankruptcy. This financial intervention, through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to protect thousands of skilled jobs in the automotive sector across the UK. The loan will boost JLR's cash reserves, enabling it to clear a backlog of payments to its 700 suppliers and ensure the stability of a vital British industry.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, former personal lawyer to President Trump. The lawsuit, filed in 2021, targeted Giuliani's persistent and baseless claims that Dominion's voting systems were manipulated to flip votes in the 2020 election. This agreement follows substantial settlements Dominion secured from Fox News and Newsmax for similar election-related falsehoods. The outcome signifies another major legal and financial blow for Giuliani, who has also faced disbarment, bankruptcy, and a $148 million judgment for defaming Georgia election workers, highlighting the severe repercussions for spreading misinformation.</p>

He urged the Global South to collectively resist protectionism and called for "de-risking" of supply chains in critical minerals, a move widely interpreted as a direct challenge to China. Jaishankar emphasized the necessity of fostering understanding and respect among nations, advocating for narratives free of prejudice, the abandonment of double standards, and a genuine appreciation for pluralism. This article underscores India's assertive stance on global trade imbalances and its increasing leadership in advocating for the economic interests of developing nations on the international stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered his administration to declassify all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart, the pioneering aviator whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has long captivated public imagination. While it's widely believed Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed near Howland Island, various theories, including a spy mission or capture by the Japanese, have persisted for decades. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands specifically requested the declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. This article highlights the enduring mystery surrounding Earhart's fate and the government's renewed effort to bring transparency to the historical inquiry, despite experts largely dismissing alternative theories.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published by Science reveals that chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from fermented fruit in the wild, ingesting a daily dose equivalent to over half a liter of beer for humans. Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and the Ivory Coast consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, accumulating nearly 14 grams of alcohol per day. This groundbreaking research suggests that regular alcohol consumption may not be solely a human cultural phenomenon but could have deeper evolutionary roots among our closest relatives. The article highlights how widespread ethanol consumption is in the natural world, prompting further investigation into its deliberate consumption and potential social benefits.</p>
