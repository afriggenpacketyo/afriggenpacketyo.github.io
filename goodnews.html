          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s announcement of his aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has temporarily halted Democratic self-reflection on his presidency and 2024 candidacy. While many express sympathy, some Democrats, including former Representative Dean Phillips, suggest the timing is a deflection from growing criticism within the party about his age and performance. The article highlights the complicated mix of concern and lingering doubts about the transparency surrounding Biden's health during his time in office, with some physicians questioning when he first learned about his condition. The situation underscores the altered legacy of his decision to run for re-election as the oldest president in history and the ongoing debate about loyalty versus national interest within both political parties.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a two-year low of 3.85%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations and reflects the country's receding inflation concerns, with the latest headline inflation figure at a four-year low of 2.4%. While the RBA aims to maintain inflation within its target range of 2% to 3%, it also acknowledges uncertainties in the economic outlook. The Australian economy has shown some recovery, with a recent GDP expansion, but analysts highlight potential downside risks from global trade tensions and domestic economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, the new president of the Kennedy Center appointed by President Trump, has alleged financial improprieties at the center and plans to refer the matter to federal prosecutors. He claims to have found "phantom revenue" and a deficit, which Kennedy Center officials attribute to a review by the new chief financial officer. Meanwhile, the center announced its upcoming season, which includes some Broadway shows with nonunion casts, a departure from past practices. This decision, along with the absence of certain artists, reflects the ongoing changes and divisions within the Kennedy Center under Trump's leadership.</p>

This influx contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating.

          <p>China has reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, as Beijing intensifies efforts to stimulate its economy. The 1-year loan prime rate was trimmed to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The move follows a series of state-backed commercial lenders reducing their deposit rates and is part of a broader package of stimulus measures. The rate cuts come amid a stronger yuan and easing trade tensions, providing room for monetary easing.</p>
