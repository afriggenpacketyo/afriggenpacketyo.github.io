          <p>British energy giant Shell reported a better-than-expected adjusted profit of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst forecasts despite a general drop in global oil and gas prices. This performance follows a strategic update in March focusing on shareholder returns, cost savings, and liquified natural gas expansion, which has been positively received by investors. Shell's share price has risen 8% this year, outperforming rivals. The article also notes Shell's recent dismissal of speculation regarding a takeover bid for BP. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the series win, Farrell maintained a pragmatic approach, opting against giving Test spots to all players, focusing on team cohesion.

This comes after the company reported a significant surge in second-quarter operating profits and secured new orders.

India's Commerce and Industry Minister stated that national interest comes first, with negotiations not bound by deadlines. Analysts suggest that the US has strategic reasons not to alienate India, viewing it as a potential alternative to China in global manufacturing and a key partner in the Indo-Pacific. India's multi-alignment strategy and ongoing trade talks with other blocs provide leverage, allowing it to navigate global economic pressures on its own terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian lawmakers are expected to vote on a bill to restore the independence of the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO). This move aims to defuse a political crisis sparked by recent amendments that curbed the agencies' powers, leading to widespread protests and warnings from European officials about jeopardizing EU membership. Activists continue to pressure lawmakers for swift approval of the new bill, emphasizing that eradicating corruption and upholding the rule of law are crucial for Ukraine's future and its bid to join the EU.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers initiated their trade deadline activity by participating in a three-team deal with the Cincinnati Reds and Tampa Bay Rays. The Dodgers acquired pitching prospect Adam Serwinowski and reliever Paul Gervase, along with catcher Ben Rortvedt, while sending minor league catcher Hunter Feduccia to Tampa Bay. Serwinowski, a left-hander, is considered the most intriguing acquisition, adding depth to the Dodgers' farm system. Despite this minor move, the team is still expected to be active on Thursday, seeking significant upgrades for their bullpen and outfield, particularly defensively, in what has been a seller's market.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a bill, AB 379, increasing penalties for some offenders who solicit 16- and 17-year-olds for sex, allowing felony charges for first offenses if the suspect is at least three years older than the minor. This "wobbler" provision targets older "johns," avoiding felony charges for all younger offenders. The bill faced controversy as Democrats initially sought amendments, arguing that prosecutorial discretion could harm victims and that a separate provision on loitering with intent to purchase commercial sex might target minorities. The new law also creates a survivor support fund from increased fines on offenders and hoteliers failing to report sexual assault.</p>
