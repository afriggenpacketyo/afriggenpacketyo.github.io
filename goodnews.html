          <p>Despite recent increases in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in Chicago, organizers and community members remain optimistic about the city's annual marathon. The event, which passes through 29 neighborhoods including the predominantly Latino area of Pilsen, is proceeding amid a tense political climate involving the Trump administration's efforts to deploy federal troops. Community groups have been actively educating residents on their rights, and volunteers will be present as a precaution, though they do not expect direct ICE operations at the race. Local business owners and run clubs acknowledge the palpable anxiety but emphasize unity and community support.</p>

          <p>Writers and editors at The Atlantic have curated a selection of foreign-language films to serve as an entry point for audiences unfamiliar with international cinema. The recommendations aim to show that compelling storytelling transcends language barriers, with subtitles being a minor hurdle to experiencing a wider world of amazing films. Among the suggestions are the Argentinian courtroom drama "Argentina, 1985," the classic French musical "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg," the haunting Soviet-era study "Burnt by the Sun," and Zhang Yimou's visually stunning martial-arts tone poem "Shadow." Each film is highlighted for its unique narrative strength and cultural significance.</p>

          <p>England's rugby league coach, Shaun Wane, is facing several challenging selection decisions ahead of announcing his squad for the autumn Ashes Test series against Australia. Key dilemmas include choosing the playmakers in the halves, selecting from a surplus of talented three-quarters, and deciding on the hooker position. With England aiming for its first series victory over the Kangaroos since 1970, the coach must balance established players with in-form contenders. The article outlines the main positional puzzles, from the potential inclusion of game-breakers like Mikey Lewis and Jake Connor to the need to introduce new front-row talent.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that his administration has identified available funds to ensure U.S. military service members receive their paychecks on October 15, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. He stated he directed the Secretary of War to use these funds under his authority as Commander in Chief. A Pentagon official indicated that approximately $8 billion in research and development funds could be used for this purpose.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has utilized an advanced AI protein language model to uncover previously hidden links between unrelated species that evolved similar traits, a phenomenon known as convergent evolution. Traditional methods focus on simple sequence similarities, but this new approach can analyze complex 3D structures and other high-order features in proteins. The research examined traits like echolocation in bats and dolphins, revealing an underappreciated sequence basis for functional convergence. This AI-driven method provides a powerful new tool for understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive the independent emergence of similar characteristics across the tree of life.</p>

          <p>Following a new ceasefire agreement, preparations are underway to significantly increase humanitarian aid entering the Gaza Strip, with hopes that it may signal an end to the two-year war. Aid convoys from Egypt are increasing, with a target of around 600 trucks per day, though they still require Israeli inspection. As Israeli forces withdraw from some areas, displaced Palestinians are beginning to return, many to find their homes destroyed. The deal also includes the release of Israeli hostages and some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with U.S. President Trump expected to visit the region for a peace summit.</p>

          <p>The European Union has begun the gradual rollout of its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will track when non-EU citizens enter and leave the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces passport stamping, requires travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a photo, upon their first entry. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, concerns remain about potential delays during the initial registration phase. The EES is being introduced in stages at airports and key border crossings like Dover and the Channel Tunnel, with full implementation expected by April 2026.</p>

          <p>The Welsh political party Plaid Cymru has committed to creating a formal plan for Welsh independence, though its leader, Rhun ap Iorwerth, has clarified this would not be a priority within the first term of a Plaid-led government. Party members endorsed a proposal to establish a "standing commission" to research constitutional issues and prepare a white paper detailing a path toward independence. This move represents a strategic shift from the party's previous promise of an independence referendum within five years. The focus for the upcoming 2026 Senedd election will be on enhancing devolution, such as gaining powers over justice and policing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has identified the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that flipping two specific genetic switches can initiate this process, known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. By understanding how differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed to form an embryo, this discovery opens up new possibilities for plant breeding, propagation, and biotechnology, offering a deeper insight into one of biology's most fundamental processes.</p>
