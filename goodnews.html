          <p>The Trump administration intervened to stop U.S. Steel from closing its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights secured during the company's acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, giving the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The move underscores the administration's increasing influence in the private sector and its commitment to protecting American manufacturing jobs as outlined in the national-security agreement for the takeover.

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., Leicester, North Carolina resident John Saunby is building his dream home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. Instead of letting the debris go to a landfill, he has repurposed items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards, incorporating them into a unique and personal construction project. This creative endeavor represents what Saunby calls his "last hurrah" in home-building, turning the destructive aftermath of the hurricane into a source of treasure and creativity.</p>

While France provided a tough challenge, England's powerful maul and second-half execution proved decisive, setting up a final showdown against Canada at a sold-out stadium next Saturday.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, a law typically reserved for national emergencies and wartime, to address the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to speed up decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. The party argues this decisive action is necessary to "get a grip" on the situation and create a more humane and efficient system.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market achieved new record highs this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq responding positively to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, and central bankers have signaled that two more cuts could occur in 2025, bringing the benchmark rate to a range of 4% to 4.25%. The move was highly anticipated by investors, who propelled the markets upward despite some initial volatility following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan since February, have been released and have returned to the United Kingdom. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for nearly two decades, were reunited with their daughter in Doha, Qatar, following negotiations that led to their release.

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that a pivotal moment was the death of Tyler Clementi, which inspired her to use her experience to help others who have been publicly shamed. Lewinsky discussed how cultural perspectives have shifted, particularly among younger generations who view her story through a lens of power dynamics, and emphasized the importance of telling one's own story to reclaim it.</p>

For many, the lower tuition fees abroad present a compelling alternative to accumulating substantial student debt from U.S. institutions, while others are seeking a different cultural and political environment.</p>

          <p>Louisa Serene Schneider left a high-paying Wall Street job in 2017 to launch Rowan, an ear-piercing business focused on safety, from her attic.

          <h2>Dermatologist Warns of UV Ray Exposure Even When Indoors Near Windows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Dr. Adam Friedman, a professor of dermatology, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while sitting indoors near a window. While glass may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, it does not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. He recommends using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, especially for those who spend extended time near windows, to protect against this "silent" exposure.</p>
