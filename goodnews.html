          <p>The Powerball jackpot, soaring to $1.7 billion, is creating a surge in business for DraftKings-owned lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in ticket sales on its platform, which operates similarly to a food delivery service by purchasing tickets on behalf of users for a fee. This growth comes despite some states, like Texas, banning such courier services. DraftKings acquired Jackpocket in 2024, viewing it as a key opportunity to cross-sell customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming products, projecting substantial future revenue from the subsidiary.</p>

The president, who was re-elected in 2024, had not attended the event in Flushing Meadows, Queens, during his first term. A White House official confirmed the president's expected attendance at the final. The finalists will be determined by Friday's matches between Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, and Jannik Sinner and Felix Auger-Aliassime, with no American players competing for the title.</p>

          <p>China has successfully executed a complex in-orbit refueling mission between two satellites in a high geosynchronous orbit, some 36,000 km above Earth. The maneuver, described by a former U.S. Space Command deputy commander as the largest of its kind, involved a significant velocity change that would typically consume years' worth of fuel. This advanced capability demonstrates China's growing prowess in space logistics and has prompted former U.S. space officials to warn that Beijing may be on track to beat the United States in the new race to the moon.</p>

          <p>A new collection of translated short stories by acclaimed South Korean filmmaker Lee Chang-dong, titled "Snowy Day and Other Stories," showcases his mastery of evocative imagery, a skill evident in his films like "Burning." The review highlights how Lee, who began his career as a fiction writer, uses visual language to communicate the harsh, paranoid atmosphere of living under South Korea's military dictatorship in the 1980s. Rather than explaining emotions or political realities directly, Lee's stories create feelings and suspense through powerful descriptions of light, darkness, and landscape, asking the reader to participate in interpreting the narrative's deeper meaning.</p>

          <p>Along India's coastline, conservationists are engaged in successful efforts to protect the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle population during nesting season. Volunteers carefully collect eggs from the shore to protect them from predators and poachers, incubating them in safe hatcheries. After the eggs hatch, the tiny turtles are collected and released onto the sand to begin their journey to the Arabian Sea. During this critical moment, conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them, shooing away predators and cheering as the hatchlings finally reach the waves.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order creating a formal "state sponsors of wrongful detention" designation, allowing the U.S. to punish countries that use detained Americans as political leverage. This new measure, modeled after the state sponsors of terrorism list, would provide the State Department with tools to penalize nations and potentially issue travel restrictions. The move is intended to deter hostage-taking and has been praised by the family of Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who was wrongfully detained by Iran and died in captivity.</p>

          <p>Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, 59, and undefeated former champion Floyd Mayweather, 48, have announced they will face each other in a boxing match in the spring of 2026. While details such as the date, location, and specific rules have not been released, Mayweather referred to the event as an exhibition, meaning it likely will not be professionally sanctioned. The announcement raises questions about the weight class and potential rule modifications, such as shorter rounds or heavier gloves, given the fighters' ages. This event continues a trend of retired boxing greats returning to the ring for high-profile exhibition matches.</p>

          <p>China's government has issued a new action plan aimed at strengthening its domestic electronics manufacturing industry, with a strong emphasis on achieving self-sufficiency in its supply chains. The plan comes as the country faces escalating U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor technology. The document, released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, frames the sector as strategic for national economic and political security. It calls for the development of core technologies and mandates the adoption of domestically produced equipment to fill critical gaps and enhance resilience against potential supply chain disruptions.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The package would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion. The plan also includes operational targets for vehicle deliveries, the production of "robotaxis," and the manufacturing of the company's humanoid Optimus robot. This proposal comes after a Delaware judge voided Musk's previous $56 billion pay package from 2018 following a shareholder lawsuit.</p>

          <h2>Report Finds Most Actively Managed Funds Failed to Outperform Index Funds in Past Year</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Morningstar report reveals that actively managed investment funds have largely failed to beat their passive index fund counterparts over the past year, with only 33% showing higher returns after fees. This underperformance occurred during a period of significant market volatility, a time when active managers often claim their strategies should excel. The long-term data is even less favorable, with just 21% of active funds surviving and outperforming their index benchmarks over the last decade. The primary driver of this trend is the significant fee difference between the two fund types. (not investment advice)</p>
