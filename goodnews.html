          <h2>Chinese scientists find sleep helps brain clean free radicals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 01:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Chinese study published in Cell Metabolism reveals that sleep enables the brain to flush out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research confirms that hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. When H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ levels rise in sleep-regulating neurons, the brain switches to "repair mode," promoting restorative slumber. The findings offer critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs disease, opening pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay for The New York Times, Drew Gilpin Faust, a historian and former president of Harvard University, reflects on the original meaning of Memorial Day, formerly Decoration Day, and its significance in contemporary times. Drawing on Frederick Douglass's concerns about remembering the purpose for which Union soldiers died in the Civil War, Faust argues that Americans must not forget the sacrifices made to preserve democracy. She contends that today's challenges to democracy, both domestically and globally, demand a renewed commitment to the principles for which those soldiers fought and died, urging citizens to speak up and stand up for these foundational ideals.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock futures experienced a surge on Monday following President Donald Trump's announcement of a delay in the imposition of a threatened 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, pushing the deadline to July 9. The decision came after a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed interest in serious negotiations. Meanwhile, Asian shares mostly declined, with Tokyo's Nikkei 225 and Seoul's Kospi showing gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and the Shanghai Composite Index both fell.</p>

          <p>China has transformed itself into a global leader in civil engineering, constructing record-breaking bridges across challenging terrains. By 2030, the world's longest suspension spans and tallest crossings will be Chinese-engineered, according to a study in the Journal of Transport Science and Engineering. Projects like the Huajiang Canyon Bridge and the Zhangjinggao Yangtze River Bridge showcase precision survey methods, advanced modeling, and innovative engineering techniques. The rapid development of artificial intelligence and automated construction equipment will further enhance bridge construction safety and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles, aiming to reduce soaring prices to approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This action addresses criticism regarding the government's perceived ineffectiveness in preventing rice prices from escalating amid broader inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice via contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. This move seeks to exert greater control over prices and alleviate consumer concerns.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake. This marks an increase from 2022, attributed to more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews and improvements in detection systems. The company's three-pronged process relies on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions. Paid reviews, often originating in Asia, are considered particularly pernicious, leading Tripadvisor to pose as fake review brokers to gather data and identify patterns.</p>
