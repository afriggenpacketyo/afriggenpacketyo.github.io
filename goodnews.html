          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are moving to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, seeking a fresh start after a challenging period that included Catherine's cancer diagnosis. The family has been living at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but the new residence is seen as their long-term 'forever home' where they intend to live even after William becomes King. A royal source indicated the move offers an opportunity to leave behind unhappy memories and begin a new chapter. The couple will fund the move and any renovations privately, continuing to prioritize a private family life without live-in staff.</p>

          <p>In Phoenix, architect Brian Stark is addressing the affordable housing crisis by transforming old shipping containers into sustainable shelters for the city's unhoused population. His "X-WING" shelters consist of four containers joined in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyards. The units, which are topped with solar panels, can be constructed in just one week, offering a rapid and environmentally friendly housing solution. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors, furthering his goal of using existing materials to create dignified living spaces.</p>

          <p>Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old founder and CEO of Epic Systems, has built the dominant electronic health record software company in the U.S. while deliberately avoiding Silicon Valley norms. From Epic's whimsical Wisconsin campus, Faulkner has maintained private ownership, never taking venture capital and instilling a unique corporate culture guided by her '10 commandments.' With an estimated net worth of $7.8 billion, she has pledged to donate 99% of her assets to charity. The article explores her unconventional leadership, the company's immense influence in healthcare, and her detailed succession plan designed to ensure Epic remains privately held after she's gone.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in the 100m race at the Silesia Diamond League meet, their first head-to-head since the Paris Olympics. Thompson finished with a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while American Lyles came in second at 9.90 seconds. The result serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second in the Olympic final a year ago. Both athletes are now looking ahead to the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, with Thompson emerging as a strong contender.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued via helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a dive team and a drone located him alive and responsive. The California Highway Patrol successfully hoisted him to safety, and he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to expedite its development of space-based solar power to strengthen its position in both the new energy sector and the ongoing space race. The technology involves building orbital facilities that convert solar energy to electricity and transmit it to Earth, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The article notes that China's current research efforts are fragmented across universities and lack a cohesive, top-down strategy. This call to action aims to close the technological gap with the United States, which has a longer history of research in this field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As an antidote to the pressures of intensive parenting, the concept of a "Lighthouse Parent" is gaining traction for promoting child independence and confidence. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence, offering safety and clarity when needed without controlling every aspect of their child's life. While the instinct to solve a child's problems is strong, constantly intervening can be exhausting for adults and detrimental to a child's development. By being a reliable beacon rather than a constant supervisor, parents can help their children learn to navigate their own challenges.</p>

Instead of a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour flexibly for activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or walking her dog.

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing significantly from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, which offer new form factors compared to the traditional design of the iPhone. While Apple still holds the top spot, its recent slip suggests a renewed competition, prompting speculation that it may release its own foldable device by 2026 to stay competitive.

          <p>Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to develop emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative emotions. First, she advises using a visual aid to remind yourself that learning and growth occur in the often-uncomfortable space between not knowing and knowing. Second, engage in positive self-talk to reframe struggles as part of the process. Finally, she recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which builds tolerance for discomfort and boosts confidence over time.</p>
