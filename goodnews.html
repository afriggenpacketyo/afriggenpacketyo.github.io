          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), emphasized to the BBC that encountering potentially offensive viewpoints is integral to education. This statement accompanies the OfS's release of guidelines for English universities regarding a new law aimed at safeguarding free speech, set to take effect in August. The guidelines address various facets of university life, including protests, debates, and teaching methods. Ahmed directly addressed students, asserting their right to express any view, regardless of its potential offensiveness, provided it remains within legal boundaries, such as not constituting harassment or unlawful discrimination. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. following the Civil War, originating on June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the freedom of enslaved people. The name is a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, marking the day the Emancipation Proclamation was enforced in Texas. Celebrations include parades, concerts, and cultural events, reflecting a joyful anniversary of independence and a remembrance of the country's history of slavery. Despite some corporate sponsorship tapering, communities continue to honor Juneteenth with festivities and reflections on freedom.</p>

His comments come as major economies prepare for the increasing use of stablecoins and their potential impact on the global economy. Zhou noted that while other countries are considering issuing their own local-currency stablecoins, USD-backed stablecoins could have a more significant global influence. This concern arises as the US Senate recently passed landmark stablecoin legislation, establishing federal guardrails for US dollar-pegged stablecoins. (not investment advice)</p>

These culinary traditions have woven themselves into the fabric of both American and Black culture, shaping the flavors and dishes that define the nation's culinary landscape.

To protect democracy in the U.S. today, we need mass legal empowerment. When we use law to tackle problems we face, we reduce the distance between our institutions and ourselves.</p>
