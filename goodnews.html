          <p>A Harvard-trained psychologist outlines seven phrases that couples who feel emotionally secure and connected use regularly, presenting them as relationship goals. These phrases reinforce feelings of acceptance, teamwork, and commitment, such as "You see me as I am" and "We'll get through this." The article emphasizes that trust is the foundation of emotional security, allowing partners to be vulnerable and handle conflict without fear. Building this level of security is a conscious effort that requires self-acceptance and a commitment to growing together over time.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, financial advisors are sharing where they are keeping their own money to balance growth and security. Popular choices include high-yield savings accounts for liquidity, money market accounts and funds for competitive returns, and laddered CDs to lock in rates while maintaining access to cash. The article emphasizes that while these tools are effective for short-term goals and emergency funds, a balanced approach that includes investments in stocks is necessary for long-term objectives like retirement. The right strategy depends on an individual's financial goals, risk tolerance, and life stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is ending its nearly 20-year-old policy requiring passengers to remove their shoes during security screening at many major U.S. airports. A recent memo outlined the change, which allows passengers in general security lines to keep their shoes on, a privilege previously reserved for TSA PreCheck members. The new policy aims to expedite the screening process, though passengers who trigger alarms will still need to remove their shoes for additional checks. The original mandate was implemented in 2006, five years after Richard Reid attempted to detonate explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight.</p>

          <p>A telescope in Chile has spotted the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, a comet designated 3I/ATLAS. Currently about 670 million kilometers from the sun, the comet poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach in October at a distance of 240 million kilometers. Scientists are studying its trajectory and composition, noting it appears larger than the previous two interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Such objects are considered pristine specimens from other planetary systems, offering a unique opportunity to study materials from beyond our solar system.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and political independent, has launched a new campaign for the U.S. Senate in Nebraska, this time challenging Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts. Osborn, who ran an unexpectedly competitive race against Sen. Deb Fischer in 2024, is framing his bid as a fight between the working class and the "billionaire class." His campaign announcement video emphasizes his background as a mechanic and Navy veteran, contrasting it with Ricketts' wealth. The Ricketts campaign has responded by labeling Osborn a liberal supported by out-of-state donors who would not support an "America First" agenda.</p>

          <p>The R&A, organizers of The Open Championship, are considering starting the third round early to mitigate disruption from a large loyalist parade planned for the same evening in Portrush. With thousands of spectators expected to leave Royal Portrush as the parade begins, there are significant concerns about logistical challenges and congestion. The parade organizers reportedly declined a request to reschedule their march, prompting the R&A to explore adjusting tee times. While any change would likely be minor due to US television broadcast schedules, it would be a notable measure to ensure fan safety and convenience.</p>

          <p>Germany's armed forces, the Bundeswehr, have reported a significant increase in volunteer applications, with numbers rising by about 20% this year. Officials attribute this trend to heightened security concerns following the war in Ukraine, which has motivated more young people to consider military service. Despite the surge, Germany is still seeking to grow its military and is implementing measures to make service more attractive. The government is also considering the option to reactivate compulsory military service if volunteer numbers prove insufficient.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain 'Revenge Saving' Trend Driven by Economic Anxiety</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 09:25:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their finances based on feelings about the economy. This has led to a trend of "revenge saving," where anxiety about rising prices and a potential recession prompts people to save more aggressively. While saving is a positive habit, financial experts advise against letting emotions drive financial decisions. They recommend a more intentional approach, such as using "reverse budgeting" to prioritize savings goals first and automating contributions to build a secure financial future.
