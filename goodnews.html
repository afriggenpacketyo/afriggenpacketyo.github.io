          <p>Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour de France stage victory with a solo attack in the race's penultimate leg. Meanwhile, Tadej Pogacar is poised to win his fourth overall Tour de France title, having safely navigated the stage and maintained his significant lead in the general classification. Barring any incidents on the final processional stage into Paris, the Slovenian cyclist's victory is all but guaranteed.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating out his teammate Oscar Piastri in a dramatic qualifying session. Norris's first lap in the final session was enough to secure the top spot, as Piastri made a small mistake on his faster second attempt. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, ahead of championship leader Max Verstappen, who was unhappy with his car's performance. With rain expected for the race, the starting grid sets the stage for a potentially chaotic and unpredictable Grand Prix at the challenging Spa-Francorchamps circuit.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a seemingly healthy 68-year-old, was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, after a routine pre-surgery X-ray revealed scarring. With his condition worsening and less than a year to live, he became a candidate for a double-lung transplant, an option he initially resisted. After a successful surgery and recovery, Kennedy has a new lease on life and plans to train another hospital therapy dog, naming it "Encore" to celebrate his second chance. His story highlights the unexpected nature of the disease and the life-saving potential of organ transplantation.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China in the autumn, though a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered. Officials in both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November. A potential meeting could occur either as a bilateral trip before the APEC summit in South Korea or on the sidelines of the event. This development follows a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, signaling ongoing high-level engagement despite persistent geopolitical tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Amid changes to federal student loan programs, a provision in the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act offers a positive development for indebted workers. The act makes the tax-free status of employer contributions toward student loans permanent, allowing companies to provide up to $5,250 annually per employee without tax implications. This move is expected to encourage more companies to offer student loan reimbursement as a benefit, providing a valuable lifeline for workers struggling with debt. Experts believe this will help with both employee retention and financial wellness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being hailed by critics as a potential "song of the summer," reflecting a national mood that is more subdued and melancholic. The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a gauzy, R&B-influenced style that is both soothing and complex. The lead single "Daisies" exemplifies this approach with its muffled production and gentle lyrics, capturing a desire for stability over excitement. This analysis suggests that the album's downtempo yet emotionally resonant sound is connecting with listeners in a way that more upbeat tracks have not this season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. global AIDS program, PEPFAR, recently avoided a $400 million funding cut after the Senate rejected the Trump administration's rescission proposal. While advocates for the program are relieved, its long-term future remains uncertain, as many of its services were disrupted by the administration's halt on foreign aid. The program's congressional authorization has expired, and there are concerns about its ability to function effectively without its full range of prevention and care initiatives. This has left global health experts feeling that while a major crisis was averted, the program is not yet on stable ground.</p>

          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes engineered to combat diseases like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. These "Wolbitos" are infected with a bacterium called Wolbachia, which prevents them from transmitting the viruses to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to scale up the project nationwide. This innovative, self-sustaining approach offers a powerful new tool in the fight against devastating mosquito-borne illnesses that affect millions annually.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams recently joked that she returned to competition "for the insurance," a comment that resonated widely and shed light on the U.S. healthcare system. After a break from the sport, she lost her WTA-provided benefits and was moved to expensive COBRA coverage. The article uses her situation as a lens to explain how health insurance in the U.S. is deeply tied to employment, a system that creates challenges even for wealthy individuals with complex health needs. Her offhand remark serves as a relatable example of the "job lock" and financial pressures created by the American healthcare model.</p>
