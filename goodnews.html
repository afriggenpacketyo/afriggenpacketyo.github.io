          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern New Jersey, with its effects felt across parts of the New York City area. The U.S. Geological Survey placed the epicenter northeast of Hasbrouck Heights in Bergen County. While the event caused brief shaking and generated local reports, there were no immediate accounts of significant damage or injuries.

          <p>Singer Justin Timberlake has publicly confirmed that he is battling Lyme disease, a condition transmitted by ticks that can cause debilitating physical and mental symptoms. In an Instagram post, he shared that he considered ending his recent tour after the diagnosis but decided to persevere for the joy of performing. Timberlake described the illness as "implacably debilitating" and expressed gratitude for the support of his family. The announcement sheds light on his recent tour cancellations, which were previously attributed to other health issues like bronchitis.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for two months in Louisiana. Clouatre, who was breastfeeding her newborn at the time of her arrest, was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application interview. Her detention stemmed from a years-old, missed immigration hearing she was unaware of, which resulted in a deportation order. Her case highlights the impact of the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement priorities on military families.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and other officials in connection with a bribery scheme involving the purchase of military drones and electronic warfare systems. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests follow the recent restoration of independence for the country's anti-corruption bodies, a key requirement in Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ten years after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Originally conceived as a "programmable money" platform, it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin transactions. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are increasingly building on Ethereum's network, using it to tokenize assets and create more efficient financial products. Despite its success, founder Vitalik Buterin warns about the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption grows. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts how immigration agents can conduct "roving" raids in the Los Angeles area. The decision affirms that federal agents from ICE and CBP must have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and cannot base arrests solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The case stemmed from controversial raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked protests and fear within the region's Latino community. The ruling is a victory for immigrant advocates who argued the sweeps were unconstitutional racial profiling.</p>

The currently unnamed party has reportedly garnered over 600,000 registered supporters. Instead of choosing a name themselves, the founders are asking supporters to suggest one as part of a broader debate on the party's platform and principles. The new entity will need to register an official name with the Electoral Commission before it can field candidates in elections, marking a significant new development in British left-wing politics.</p>

While the Lakers have publicly committed to Dončić, building the team around him, James's long-term plans with the organization remain unclear.

          <p>British comedian Harry Hill has shared that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was a key factor in his decision to leave his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who qualified as a doctor in 1988, felt unsuited for the emotional demands of medicine and realized he did not want to spend his life in a profession he wasn't passionate about. He recalled a particularly difficult experience breaking bad news to a patient's family, which solidified his feeling of being "out of his depth." This personal tragedy ultimately set him free to pursue entertainment.</p>

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly prepared to sell Danish striker Rasmus Hojlund for around £30 million, despite him only being two years into a five-year contract. This development comes as the club continues to show interest in signing RB Leipzig's forward Benjamin Sesko. While United sources claim they can sign a new player without first selling, an exit would be necessary to comply with Premier League profit and sustainability rules. If Sesko were to arrive, Hojlund's position at the club would become marginalized, prompting the potential sale.</p>

This shift in thinking contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, where companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI are rapidly releasing advanced models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's competitive "Darwinian" open-source ecosystem could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in AI development.

          <p>The long-standing mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II died has finally been solved by researchers. The young platypus, named Winston, was sent from Australia in 1943 as a diplomatic gift but perished just days before reaching England. For decades, it was rumored that the animal died from shell-shock after its ship encountered a German U-boat. However, newly analyzed archival records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal that the platypus likely died from heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding a safe threshold.</p>
