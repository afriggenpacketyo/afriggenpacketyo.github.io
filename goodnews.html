          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn announced a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing market expectations. This growth was primarily driven by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, with sales from server products accounting for 41% of revenue and overtaking consumer electronics for the first time. The company, a key partner for Nvidia and the main assembler of Apple's iPhones, anticipates its AI server business will continue to fuel growth and has been expanding production in India in response to global tariff situations.

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that analysts believe could create an opportunity for enhanced counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China via Pakistan. The BLA has been responsible for attacks in a region where China has significant economic interests, often targeting Chinese nationals. This action by the U.S. State Department is seen as a step toward addressing Beijing's long-standing security concerns in the area and fostering a potential side effect of improved trilateral relations on this specific issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BTecs are practical, vocational qualifications in the UK, assessed through a mix of coursework, projects, and exams, serving as an alternative or supplement to traditional GCSEs and A-levels. Graded from Pass to Distinction Star, they are a popular route to university or direct employment, especially in fields like health and social care. Recent UK government plans to defund many BTecs in favor of new T-levels were partially reversed, with funding for 157 key qualifications extended. This decision acknowledges the vital role these courses play for many students, particularly in crucial economic sectors.</p>

          <p>As students in the UK receive their A-level results, this guide explains the key processes involved. Grade boundaries, which determine the marks needed for each grade (A* to E), are released by exam boards on results day. Students who believe their grade is incorrect can appeal through their school or college, which can lead to a mark review. For those who miss their university offer grades, the UCAS clearing system provides a pathway to find available courses, while resitting exams next year remains another viable option.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for a New Mexico state House seat, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for organizing a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his November 2022 election loss, which he baselessly claimed was fraudulent. Although no one was injured, Peña was convicted on 13 felony charges, including conspiracy and intimidation, for orchestrating the politically motivated violence. He also attempted to have his co-conspirators murdered to prevent their testimony.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the 0.7% growth seen in the first quarter but better than the 0.1% forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. While the government hailed the figures as positive, economists expressed doubt that this pace could be maintained, citing the weak global economy and the potential for cautious consumer spending. The data suggests the economy avoided stagnation despite facing significant headwinds.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. The amendment was championed by lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution's original text, a concern that became more urgent after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The narrative details the multi-year effort to convince lawmakers of the need for clear instructions on what should happen if a president is unable to serve. The amendment provides a crucial framework for ensuring stability and continuity in the executive branch during a crisis.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of South Korea has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, creators of the viral children's song "Baby Shark." US composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 hit copied his 2011 version of the song. However, the court upheld lower court rulings, stating that Wright's rendition did not contain enough original modification to a traditional folk melody to warrant copyright protection. Pinkfong maintained that their song is based on a public domain chant popular at U.S. summer camps for many years.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the proportion of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Only 50% of adults aged 18-34 report drinking, and they are more likely to view moderate consumption as unhealthy. Experts suggest this shift is driven by increased health awareness, the social acceptability of not drinking, and economic factors, reflecting a significant change in cultural attitudes toward alcohol.</p>
