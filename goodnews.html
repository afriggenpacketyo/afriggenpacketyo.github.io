        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a scientific refutation of claims by the Trump administration linking the painkiller Tylenol (acetaminophen) to rising autism rates. It explains that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with strong genetic links, and no single factor is considered a cause. Experts cited in the article emphasize that large-scale studies have not established a causal link, and the rise in diagnoses is better explained by increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria. The piece also reiterates that the thoroughly debunked theory connecting vaccines to autism has no scientific basis.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade agreement, a process that was reportedly accelerated by the global trade landscape shaped by U.S. tariff policies. The deal, known as the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports like car parts and pharmaceuticals while opening investment opportunities in Indonesia. For Indonesia, the pact provides tariff-free access for key exports such as palm oil and textiles to the EU's large consumer market. This agreement marks the EU's third such deal with a Southeast Asian nation, pending ratification.</p>

          <p>Shares in Danish renewable energy company Orsted saw a significant increase after a U.S. court issued an injunction against the Trump administration's order to halt construction of the Revolution Wind project. This ruling allows the nearly completed offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, to resume development. The decision provides a major reprieve for Orsted, which has faced substantial challenges due to the administration's policies favoring fossil fuels and suspending new wind leases. The legal victory is seen as a positive development for the U.S. offshore wind industry. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS in England is launching a new initiative named "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. Her family hopes the guidance will prevent similar tragedies by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists sooner. The initiative aims to make this "three strikes and rethink" approach standard practice to improve patient safety.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, currently a major hurricane in the Atlantic, is forecast to weaken as it travels eastwards but could still impact the UK's weather over the coming weekend. While its exact path remains uncertain, with different weather models showing conflicting scenarios, there is a possibility it will bring more rain and wind to a country that has already experienced a very wet September. Ahead of the weekend, a high-pressure system is expected to bring drier and cooler conditions across most of the UK. Forecasters are closely monitoring the storm's trajectory to determine its potential effects on either the UK or mainland Europe.</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is returning to the air after ABC ended his "indefinite" suspension, a move prompted by a significant public relations backlash against the network and its parent company, Disney. Kimmel was suspended for comments he made about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which were deemed insensitive. The suspension drew widespread criticism from free speech advocates and numerous celebrities, who argued the network was caving to government pressure. The article suggests that the intense public outcry and accusations of censorship left the company with little choice but to reinstate the prominent host.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, marking a 10% increase from the same period last year. This growth demonstrates the sector's resilience and continued momentum, even as the Trump administration actively works to dismantle low-carbon projects and policies in the United States. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics shows that low-carbon energy is expected to attract about double the investment of fossil fuels this year. The data suggests that corporate and international climate commitments remain strong despite political headwinds in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Dashixia Water Control Project in Xinjiang has begun storing water, marking the completion of the world's tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam at 247 meters. The project is notable for being the first of its kind constructed using a full suite of intelligent technologies, including AI, digital twin modeling, and unmanned equipment. This "3D-printing-like" construction method allowed engineers to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The dam's completion represents a major milestone in the application of artificial intelligence to large-scale infrastructure projects, enhancing safety and efficiency.</p>

          <p>Struggling Chinese property developer Seazen Group is seeking to issue new U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, reflecting a broader trend of Chinese companies returning to offshore debt markets. This resurgence in issuance, the strongest since 2022, suggests that channels for international financing are reopening after being largely closed during China's property crisis. A more favorable interest-rate environment is allowing companies to refinance existing debt on better terms. Seazen's move is a notable sign of a potential thaw in investor sentiment towards a sector that had been considered highly risky. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Ambassador to China, David Perdue, has indicated that a much-anticipated meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to occur early next year rather than this fall. Speaking during a rare visit to Beijing by a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, Perdue described the relationship between the two leaders as "very good and very encouraging." The comments temper expectations for a meeting at an upcoming summit in South Korea, which Trump had previously suggested. The focus of the lawmakers' visit was to improve communication, particularly on military issues, to prevent miscalculations.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, a pediatrician addresses the recent comments from the U.S. president linking paracetamol use during pregnancy to autism, calling them "very worrying." He emphasizes that there is no scientific evidence of causation and that major studies have disproven such a link, while alternative pain medications can pose known risks to a fetus. The author trusts the rigorous assessment of regulatory bodies, which classify paracetamol as safe for pregnant women. He warns that spreading unscientific claims causes significant distress and can lead to poor health outcomes.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release $500 million in frozen grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The ruling for a preliminary injunction stated the government likely violated federal law by not providing specific procedures or explanations for the cuts. The administration had suspended over half a billion dollars in federal grants to UCLA, citing allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. The restored funds primarily support hundreds of critical medical research projects, including studies on Parkinson's disease, cancer recovery, and nerve regeneration.</p>
