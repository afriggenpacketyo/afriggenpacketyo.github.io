          <p>The United States Men's National Team faces an uphill battle in defining a successful summer, with the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup carrying unique challenges. While winning the tournament would be a familiar achievement, failing to do so would raise significant questions, especially with key players absent. Coach Mauricio Pochettino aims to use the summer to identify new depth pieces and tactical alternatives, potentially giving opportunities to players from Major League Soccer. The focus will be on cultivating team closeness and intensity, aiming for a performance that demonstrates growth and potential, regardless of the Gold Cup outcome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is believed to be the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in northern Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped over 300 acres of parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprising, given the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery highlights the extensive and sophisticated farming practices of Native Americans before European colonization, challenging previous assumptions about their agricultural capabilities.</p>

          <p>In this L.A. Affairs column, a woman recounts her experiences with co-parenting, dating, and taking care of a cat she initially didn't want after her divorce. She acquired the cat out of a sense of single-parent shame and a desire for uniformity between her home and her ex-husband's. Over the years, she grappled with the responsibilities of pet ownership, eventually considering giving the cat away, but ultimately honoring her commitment. The essay explores themes of co-parenting challenges, personal growth, and the complexities of relationships after divorce. </p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a plan to enhance the disaster resilience of the country's infrastructure over the next five years, with the project expected to cost more than 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan addresses aging infrastructure and specifies 326 measures to be taken by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. The approval comes in light of prolonged water outages following the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a massive sinkhole in Saitama Prefecture. The plan allocates funds for maintenance of vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and enhancing disaster preparedness.</p>
