          <p>A photograph of Senator Bernie Sanders, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in Queens has gained significant attention online. The three prominent progressive politicians met ahead of a "Fighting Oligarchy" town hall in Brooklyn, where Sanders is supporting Mamdani's political platform. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, is advocating for policies such as increased taxes on the wealthy to fund public services like free buses and state-run grocery stores. The gathering highlights the continued collaboration and influence of the progressive wing within the Democratic party, with established figures like Sanders promoting younger voices.</p>

          <p>Somerset secured a dramatic victory over the Bears to advance to the T20 Blast finals day, thanks to a remarkable late-game performance by Sean Dickson. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, clinching the win with just one ball to spare and finishing with an unbeaten 71 from 26 balls. The Bears had set a competitive total of 190-6, largely due to captain Alex Davies' 71, and appeared poised for victory. However, Dickson's explosive batting overturned the deficit in a thrilling conclusion, sending Somerset to the semi-finals against Lancashire.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Los Angeles Chargers and the Kansas City Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is a key component of the league's long-term global strategy. The event, part of a record seven international games this season, demonstrates the NFL's focus on building a sustained, year-round presence in new markets rather than hosting one-off events. With nearly 50,000 fans in attendance and a new media deal with Brazil's largest media company, the league aims to cultivate its international fan base, which already includes an estimated 36 million fans in Brazil alone.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a young American pilot and social media influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean airbase in Antarctica. Guo was held after landing his small plane on Chilean territory without proper authorization while attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents for charity. He was released after agreeing to pay $30,000 in penalties, donate his raised funds to a Chilean children's cancer foundation, and accept a three-year ban from the country. His lawyer contended the landing was due to poor weather.</p>

          <p>England defeated Andorra 2-0 in a World Cup qualifier, but the victory was overshadowed by a lackluster and uninspired performance that drew criticism. Despite dominating possession, Thomas Tuchel's side struggled to create clear chances against the 174th-ranked team, relying on an own goal and a Declan Rice header to secure the points. The performance has raised concerns about the team's direction and lack of identity under Tuchel, who took over after Euro 2024. While England remains in a strong position to qualify, the turgid display suggests they have not improved since the previous management.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has set a new all-time Formula 1 speed record during his pole position-winning lap at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris surpassed the previous record, held by Lewis Hamilton since 2020, with Verstappen achieving an average speed of 164.466 mph. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's high-speed layout. This achievement marks a significant milestone in F1 performance, eclipsing the speeds of even the iconic V10-era cars.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, secured their place in the World Cup quarter-finals after a 47-7 victory against Australia.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that this action sends a clear message that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences, including economic sanctions and visa restrictions.
