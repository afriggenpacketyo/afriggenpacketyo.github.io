          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump and other plaintiffs after his suspension from the platform in 2021. This article details that $22 million of the settlement will support Trump’s White House State Ballroom construction, with $2.5 million going to other plaintiffs. YouTube had suspended Trump’s account following the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, citing incitement to violence, but restored it over two years later. The settlement, which does not admit liability, follows similar agreements this year between Trump and other social media companies like Meta and X regarding his account suspensions.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the current artificial intelligence boom differs significantly from the 2000 dotcom bubble, emphasizing the quality and robust funding of today's leading tech companies. This article highlights Cramer's view that major players like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon are more substantive and financially stable than many dotcom-era outfits, capable of absorbing bad investments. While acknowledging Wall Street's skepticism, he suggests these tech giants are unlikely to collapse. Cramer, however, advises continued scrutiny of stock moves and investments in the AI space, believing that skepticism helps keep the market in check and prevents irrational exuberance.

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced an action plan to curb output growth in the non-ferrous metals sector, projecting a 1.5% increase this year, down from 4.3% last year. This article explains the focus is shifting from production volume to optimizing industrial structure, aiming for an average annual growth rate of about 5% in value-added output. The plan also prioritizes exploration of strategic metals like copper, lithium, and nickel, along with developing ultra-pure materials and enhancing battery recycling. This move addresses depressed processing fees and squeezed smelter margins in a sector vital for China's manufacturing and hi-tech industries. (not investment advice)</p>
