          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Canada for the G7 summit, providing an opportunity to reset strained relations between the two countries. Tensions arose after Canada accused Indian government agents of assassinating Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen and Sikh activist, allegations that India denies. Despite the strained relations, strong trade and people-to-people ties exist between India and Canada. The visit also provides Modi with the chance to address global issues with key world leaders.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough in the commercial extraction of rubidium directly from salt lake brine. This development could reduce China's reliance on imports, mainly from Canada, which currently supply two-thirds of its needs. The new industrial-scale method produces ultra-pure rubidium chloride from ultra-low concentrations. Rubidium is a strategically vital metal used in electronics, specialty glass, and aerospace sectors.</p>

          <p>China and India have agreed to work towards resuming direct flights as part of efforts to stabilize relations. The agreement was reached during talks between Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri and Chinese foreign vice-minister Sun Weidong. The two sides also agreed to take practical steps for visa facilitation and exchanges between media and think-tanks. This marks the first visit by a senior Chinese official to India since the recent conflict with Pakistan over Kashmir.</p>

The paper plans to embrace AI-written content permanently, with a weekly AI section and occasional AI-written articles in the standard paper. The editor emphasizes that AI should augment rather than replace human intelligence in journalism. He also highlights AI's strengths in research, summarizing, and writing, but notes its limitations in finding news, developing sources, and generating original ideas.</p>

          <p>HSBC's co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, David Liao, suggests that Hong Kong can play a critical role in promoting the internationalization of the yuan. Hong Kong, as a financial hub, can expand the yuan's offshore liquidity while maintaining safeguards and risk management. Liao notes that mainland businesses plan to expand overseas and diversify their portfolios, with Hong Kong often being the top choice for financing channels. He suggests further scaling up yuan-denominated trade finance, as the yuan is currently the third most used currency for global trade finance.</p>
