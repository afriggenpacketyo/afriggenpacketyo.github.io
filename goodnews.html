          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have agreed to a deal aimed at resetting their relationship following Britain's exit from the bloc in 2020. The agreement, reached during a summit in London, includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, cooperation on energy and security, and a youth mobility scheme to facilitate work, study, and travel for young people. The deal also addresses irregular migration challenges and explores the use of e-gates for UK passport holders at European airports.
