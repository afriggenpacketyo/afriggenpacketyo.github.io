          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the initial vote in November was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The original election saw a far-right, pro-Russian candidate surprisingly leading in the first round, prompting an investigation into campaign financing and organization. Voters are now choosing between pro-EU candidates and hard-right figures, with the outcome potentially influencing Romania's stance on European integration and support for Ukraine. The decision to annul the election and ban the initial frontrunner has drawn criticism from various international figures, adding further complexity to the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Canton Fair, China's largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a surge in international buyers, particularly from Latin America and Central Asia, while the presence of American buyers has decreased.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of making mothers feel guilty about their parenting choices. The author points out that while concerns about ultra-processed foods and sugar content are valid, the moral judgment placed on mothers for using convenient options like pouches is excessive. The article highlights the societal pressures on women to engage in intensive mothering and the unrealistic expectations of cooking everything from scratch. The author also argues that the debate often ignores the social, political, and economic factors that influence parents' choices, such as time constraints and access to resources.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX launch site in South Texas has been formally organized as the city of Starbase, following a vote by local residents. The decision allows SpaceX to manage local infrastructure and potentially streamline launch operations. Critics express concern over Musk's increasing control over the area and potential restrictions on public access to a nearby beach and state park. The creation of Starbase reflects Musk's ambition to develop a self-sufficient community around SpaceX's operations.</p>
