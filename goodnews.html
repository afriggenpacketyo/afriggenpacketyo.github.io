          <p>The UK and US are poised for a "golden age" of nuclear power, marked by the announcement of five new commercial deals ahead of President Trump's state visit. Key agreements include plans for a new advanced modular reactor (AMR) plant in Hartlepool, developed by US firm X-Energy and British Gas-owner Centrica, and data centers powered by small modular reactors (SMRs) at a former coal plant in Nottinghamshire, a collaboration between EDF and Holtec. The new Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy seeks to accelerate projects by reducing bureaucracy and harmonizing safety standards. Both governments are heavily investing in nuclear technology to meet escalating electricity demands, particularly from AI, and to achieve ambitious climate targets.</p>

          <p>Jim Edgar, a respected two-term Republican governor of Illinois, has passed away at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Edgar is widely credited with guiding the state into a period of greater financial stability during the 1990s. Known for his moderate political stance, he successfully implemented budget cuts and secured the permanent extension of a temporary income tax surcharge, which provided a stable funding source for public schools. Despite his considerable popularity, Edgar chose not to seek a third term and later distanced himself from the Republican Party's rightward shift, even endorsing Kamala Harris in the previous presidential election. He is remembered for his integrity and significant contributions to Illinois state government.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Zheng Yongnian advocates for China to develop its own distinct knowledge system for artificial intelligence, urging the nation to look beyond Western-centric frameworks to prevent "intellectual colonialism." Zheng contends that existing Western social science theories, while influential, are fundamentally rooted in Western practices and experiences, rendering them inadequate for explaining diverse civilizations such as Confucianism, the Islamic world, or Indian society. He asserts that for China to effectively contribute to and shape the international order, it must fully embrace its unique secular civilization and cultivate an AI ecosystem that genuinely reflects its indigenous societal and cultural values, fostering independent innovation and global influence.</p>

          <p>Chloé Zhao's poignant film "Hamnet," which delves into the profound influence of Shakespeare's son's death on his iconic play "Hamlet," has clinched the coveted Toronto International Film Festival People's Choice Award. This accolade is widely regarded as a significant predictor for future Oscar success. The film, adapted from Maggie O’Farrell’s acclaimed book, thoughtfully centers on the perspective of Shakespeare's wife, Agnes. Notably, Zhao previously earned this same prestigious award for her film "Nomadland," which subsequently secured three Academy Awards. Other key festival honors included "The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue" for the Documentary category and Park Chan-wook's "No Other Choice" for the International People's Choice Award, showcasing a diverse array of cinematic achievements.</p>

          <p>The NFL witnessed a series of dramatic games, highlighted by the Dallas Cowboys' thrilling 40-37 overtime victory against the New York Giants, extending their division winning streak to nine. Brandon Aubrey's 46-yard field goal clinched the win after a wild fourth quarter. In Cincinnati, the Bengals secured a 31-27 comeback win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but the triumph was marred by quarterback Joe Burrow suffering a toe injury that will keep him out for several weeks. Elsewhere, the Seattle Seahawks capitalized on Pittsburgh Steelers' errors for a win, the Detroit Lions routed the Chicago Bears with five Jared Goff touchdowns, and the Buffalo Bills cruised past the New York Jets despite Josh Allen's early injury scare.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a prominent foreign policy leader and former chairman of both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, has announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026 after serving 11 terms. McCaul expressed a desire for a "new challenge" within the national security and foreign policy realm, aiming to continue his public service in a different capacity. Throughout his career, he was a staunch advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine and led a multi-year investigation into the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. Notably, McCaul was sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party following a bipartisan delegation visit to Taiwan, an honor he wore as a "badge of honor." His impending departure signals a significant shift for Texas Republicans amidst ongoing redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 Paris Hilton Mini Beauty Fridges have been recalled by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission due to significant fire and burn risks. The recall specifically targets certain 4-liter and 10-liter models manufactured before August 2024, identifiable by specific model and serial numbers. Although no injuries have been reported to date, there have been at least 27 documented incidents of the mini fridges overheating and catching fire, prompting this urgent safety measure. Consumers are strongly advised to immediately cease using the recalled units, unplug them, and register for a refund through the manufacturer's website by submitting photographs that confirm the model and serial numbers, and verify that the power cord has been cut.</p>

          <p>Barron Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly opted to attend NYU's D.C. program, choosing to reside closer to his parents in Washington. This unexpected move from NYU's main Manhattan campus has ignited considerable speculation regarding his potential future involvement in politics, particularly given his previous assistance with his father's campaign efforts. The highly selective NYU D.C. program is primarily designed for students pursuing studies in politics, public policy, or journalism. Although Barron was previously enrolled in the NYU Stern School of Business, his new academic environment suggests a possible shift towards a more politically oriented academic and career path, fueling public interest in his trajectory.</p>
