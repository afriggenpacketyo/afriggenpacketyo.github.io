          <h2>Archaeological Discovery in China Suggests an Early 'Wood Age' in East Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals the discovery of dozens of 300,000-year-old wooden artifacts in southwest China, providing the first major evidence of a 'Wood Age' in East Asia. Unearthed at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province, the tools fill a significant gap in the archaeological record, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little trace. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences have hailed the finding as a world-class discovery. The site, located near Fuxian Lake, had previously been named one of China's top archaeological finds in 2015 for its other significant relics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:27:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The event, which occurred early Thursday, was witnessed by dozens of people in the west Highlands who reported an orange glow and a loud bang. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, was observed traveling at over 12,000 mph before it likely broke apart. While finding the meteorites in the vast, mountainous terrain will be difficult, hillwalkers are being asked to keep an eye out for the space rocks.</p>

          <p>Spanish international winger Nico Williams has signed a new 10-year contract with Athletic Bilbao, ending speculation of a move to clubs like Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The 22-year-old, who was instrumental in Spain's Euro 2024 victory, has extended his terms until 2035. The new deal reportedly increases his release clause by 50% from its previous €62 million. Williams, a product of Bilbao's youth academy, stated that his heart was the biggest factor in his decision to remain at his home club, where he plays alongside his brother, Iñaki.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the military flight team responsible for the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities will be honored at a White House celebration on Independence Day. Speaking at a rally, Trump praised the pilots and crew for what he called one of the greatest military maneuvers in U.S. history, stating they successfully obliterated all targets. The president criticized early media reports that downplayed the mission's success, arguing it demeaned the military personnel involved. The entire flight and support crew will be recognized for their execution of the mission.</p>

While these products can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost during intense exercise, plain water remains the best option for general hydration. Doctors caution consumers to check labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium. Individuals with chronic conditions such as kidney or heart disease should consult a physician before using these supplements, as they can interfere with maintaining critical fluid and electrolyte balances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that to effectively defend liberal democracy, Americans must re-engage with its core philosophical justifications, particularly the concept of "value pluralism" as articulated by thinker Isaiah Berlin. This idea posits that legitimate human values are diverse and often in conflict, meaning no single utopian vision can be imposed without loss. Therefore, democracy's strength lies in allowing individuals the freedom to choose how to balance these competing values in their own lives. The analysis suggests this framework provides a robust defense against totalitarian thinking from both the left and right.</p>
