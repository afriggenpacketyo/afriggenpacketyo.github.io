          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth unmanned test flight of the Starship spacecraft from its Starbase facility in Texas, aiming to achieve key objectives such as deploying Starlink satellite simulators and performing a Raptor engine relight in space. Previous test flights experienced hardware failures, leading to the destruction of the spacecraft and debris falling across South Florida and the Atlantic. This flight incorporates significant modifications based on lessons learned, including testing different thermal tile options and materials during reentry. The company aims for Starship to be fully reusable, capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance, marking a crucial step toward Elon Musk's goal of sending humans to Mars. The Super Heavy booster will follow a modified flight path, splashing down in the Gulf after testing new configurations.</p>

          <p>Kelly Wakefield, a professional gardener, stumbled upon a hidden metal box containing coins, antiques, and a map while cleaning a public park in St. Albans, Vermont. The treasure chest was intentionally hidden by Michael Cloherty O‚ÄôConnell, the author of two history books that lead readers on scavenger hunts around the Northeast. O'Connell, a retired history buff, used his retirement funds to create these treasure hunts, hoping to engage readers with American history. The hidden chests collectively contain antiques worth upward of $100,000, and Wakefield intends to participate in more treasure hunts this summer, inspired by her discovery.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his intention to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal conservatorship. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believe it could benefit taxpayers and the housing market. However, critics such as Senator Elizabeth Warren warn that privatization could raise mortgage rates and reward Wall Street at the expense of homebuyers. The Trump administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency to advance homeownership, but any actions will be carefully evaluated to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Curtis Jackson III, also known as 50 Cent, has been granted permission to seize the Connecticut home of Mitchell Green, a former executive who confessed to embezzling from Jackson's Sire Spirits company. The legal battle, spanning over four years, concluded with a federal judge lifting an automatic stay that had prevented the property transfer. Green's embezzlement, involving kickbacks from wholesalers, led to a $7 million debt, which the home seizure will partially offset. Amidst this legal victory, Jackson has also been publicly mocking Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs, who is currently facing a federal sex trafficking trial.</p>

The White House announced the decision, sharing a video of Trump informing the Chrisleys' daughter, Savannah, of the impending pardons. The Chrisleys were found guilty of submitting fake financial statements to obtain millions in loans, with Todd sentenced to 12 years and Julie to seven years in prison. Savannah Chrisley has been a vocal advocate for her parents' release, alleging corruption in the court proceedings and speaking at the Republican National Convention in support of Trump.</p>

          <p>Tesco shoppers are reacting to the introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, which uses overhead cameras to detect unscanned items, with some joking about its resemblance to football's Video Assistant Referee (VAR). The supermarket aims to reduce shoplifting, which has reached record highs in the UK, by showing a live-action replay when an item isn't scanned properly. While some customers mocked the technology, others expressed concerns about increased surveillance and said they would no longer use self-checkouts. Similar AI recognition technology has also been rolled out by Sainsbury's.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted the deportation of Eyidi Ambila, a Maine resident from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who claims he was illegally detained by ICE for eight months. The ACLU filed a habeas corpus petition arguing that ICE had held Ambila illegally without providing information about their plans for him. Judge Woodcock issued an emergency ruling preventing Ambila's deportation, citing the lack of evidence that the DRC would accept him and the federal government's failure to secure travel papers since 2007. The ruling allows Ambila to maintain contact with his lawyers and challenges his circumstances in court.</p>

While Circle did not provide a reason, this decision likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and has almost $850 million in cash, but Silicon Valley's tech investors are eager to secure exits and distribute funds to their own investors (not investment advice).</p>
