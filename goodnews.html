          <p>Nottingham Forest is set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach following the dismissal of Nuno Espirito Santo after just 21 months in charge. Postecoglou, who was sacked by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, arrived at Forest's training ground on Tuesday. The move has reportedly surprised many players at the club, which currently sits 10th in the Premier League, and marks another managerial change under owner Evangelos Marinakis, making Postecoglou the eighth permanent manager since 2017.</p>

          <p>With the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage approaching a one-year low but still significantly higher than pandemic-era levels, financial experts are highlighting strategies for homebuyers to obtain better loan terms. Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly translate to lower interest rates, and increasing the down payment to at least 20% to reduce lender risk and avoid private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which can offer a lower initial rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The growing trend of institutional investors like private equity firms buying single-family homes to rent them out has a nuanced effect on neighborhoods, according to recent research. While this practice can drive up home prices and make ownership more difficult for middle-class families, it also increases the availability of rental options in suburban areas. This has been shown to make these neighborhoods more affordable and diverse, providing lower-income and nonwhite families with access to areas, and potentially better schools, that were previously inaccessible due to the high cost of homeownership.</p>

          <p>In his new book, researcher Elliot Haspel argues that for the U.S. to create a robust, federally funded child-care system, advocates must shift their messaging. He contends that the common economic argument—that child care enables parents to work—is "morally impoverished" and fails to build broad public support. Instead, Haspel proposes framing high-quality, accessible child care as a fundamental American value and a right, similar to public education, that strengthens families, communities, and the nation as a whole, which could be a more compelling case for transformative policy change.</p>
