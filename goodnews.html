          <p>Morgan Stanley indicates that over 90% of US investors plan to increase their exposure to Chinese stocks, marking the highest interest level in five years. This reversal from a multi-year retreat is attributed to China's sector leadership, efforts to stabilize its economy and equity market, and a growing demand for diversification from US assets. Investors are particularly keen on humanoid robotics, biotech, and new consumer companies, extending their interest beyond US-listed Chinese equities to the onshore market through A-share ETFs and index-future products. Morgan Stanley suggests significant capital inflows are likely as investors complete due diligence. (not investment advice)</p>

Some entities also lost qualifications for projects across the entire People's Liberation Army.

The Rocket Force, established in 2015, oversees critical assets including China's strategic nuclear missiles, making the integrity of its supply chain paramount.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their National League West lead to three games, but faced another injury concern as catcher Will Smith was a late scratch due to renewed swelling in his right hand. Despite activating Tommy Edman from the injured list, Smith's bone bruise flared up, raising doubts about his availability for upcoming games. Mookie Betts delivered a stellar performance with five RBIs, including a grand slam, supporting Blake Snell's dominant six-inning, 11-strikeout start. The team aims to manage its injured roster to maintain momentum as the season progresses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Under manager David Moyes, Everton has achieved a significant turnaround, moving from near relegation to fifth in the Premier League after a record-breaking summer recruitment drive. The club's net spend of £97 million, its highest ever in a transfer window, has allowed it to overhaul a depleted squad with nine new players. This financial shift, supported by the Friedkin Group's takeover and improved stadium revenues, signals a more sustainable economic model after previous points deductions. The strategic acquisitions and Moyes' leadership are positioning Everton to potentially challenge for a first trophy since 1995.</p>

          <h2>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Demands Clear Evidence in Clippers Salary Cap Investigation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 01:17:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver stated that the league requires clear evidence before taking action against the Clippers and owner Steve Ballmer, who are under investigation for allegedly circumventing the salary cap. The probe stems from claims that star Kawhi Leonard received a $28 million endorsement deal from a fraudulent sustainability firm that also sponsored the Clippers. Silver emphasized that the burden of proof lies with the league, which has hired an experienced law firm to investigate whether Ballmer directed the firm to make the deal with Leonard. The outcome could lead to severe penalties, including forfeited draft picks and fines.</p>

          <p>Faced with an industry-wide slump and cost pressures, luxury fashion brands like Louis Vuitton are diversifying their product lines to attract new consumers with more accessible items, such as $160 lipsticks and $1,400 bag charms. This strategy aims to engage aspirational consumers and build brand loyalty without diluting flagship offerings, drawing parallels to past successful expansions into streetwear and smaller accessories. While beauty products offer high gross margins, brands must carefully balance exclusivity with broader appeal to avoid the pitfalls of heavy discounting that previously impacted labels like Burberry and Gucci. The long-term success of this approach remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Olympic 800m champion Keely Hodgkinson is aiming for her first World Championship gold in Tokyo after a "most challenging year" marked by two torn hamstrings. Following a 376-day competitive absence, the 23-year-old made an explosive comeback in August, running the fastest time of the year. Despite fears she wouldn't be ready, Hodgkinson views her return as a bonus, having used the time to rebuild strength and develop a renewed sense of enjoyment for her sport. Her coaches believe she is capable of a one-two finish with training partner Georgia Hunter Bell, reflecting her strong determination.</p>

SoftBank's connection to Oracle, highlighted by their joint role in the $500 billion Stargate program, has boosted investor confidence. Energy and utilities stocks also contributed to the Nikkei's gains, indicating broad market optimism in Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a strategic mineral exploration initiative over the past five years, resulting in significant breakthroughs in oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium discoveries. Geologists mapped 163 mineral types, finding over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, including 10 new large oilfields and 19 major gas fields. These efforts aim to enhance energy security and reduce reliance on imports amid geopolitical tensions and booming demand from new tech development. The findings support China's stable annual oil and natural gas production.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Redfin report claims San Francisco's housing costs have returned to "normal," meaning prices relative to local incomes are back to July 2018 levels, with Oakland also projected to follow suit. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth and falling mortgage rates, alongside significantly faster wage growth for tech workers. However, "normal" still implies high costs, with San Francisco households spending 74% of their income on mortgages in 2018, far above the national average. The AI boom is also spiking rents, further challenging affordability for lower-wage tenants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may contain the strongest hints yet of ancient microscopic life. Scientists emphasize that in-depth analysis on Earth is needed before conclusive findings, but the 25th sample gathered from the Neretva Vallis mudstones showed organic carbon and minuscule specks enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these compounds are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. While non-biological processes could also be responsible, researchers consider this the most compelling candidate in the rover's search for long-ago life, despite delays in the sample return mission.</p>

          <p>China has launched the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, in Jiangsu province, significantly reducing travel time between Changzhou and Taizhou. Spanning 10.3km with a 1,208-meter main span, this mega-structure is the first river crossing to integrate an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on the same structure. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, accommodating a high-speed railway on one side and a regular road on the other—a pioneering side-by-side traffic layout for a large-span bridge. This engineering feat showcases China's advanced infrastructure capabilities.</p>
