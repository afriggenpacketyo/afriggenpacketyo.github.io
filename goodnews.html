          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced that his country will formally recognize a Palestinian state, following similar signals from other Western nations. The decision, to be formalized at the UN in September, is conditioned on commitments from the Palestinian Authority, including no role for Hamas and the demilitarization of Gaza. Albanese described the move as a practical step toward a two-state solution to end the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>Media mogul Byron Allen is re-entering late-night television as his show "Comics Unleashed" takes over the 12:30 a.m. slot on CBS, following the final season of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert." The move comes as the late-night genre faces economic pressures, with Allen's low-cost production model offering a financially viable alternative for the network. Allen's approach involves producing evergreen, family-friendly comedy that has a long shelf life, a stark contrast to the expensive, topical nature of traditional late-night shows.</p>

          <p>Amid recent moves by several countries to recognize a Palestinian state, this article explains the complex process of what constitutes a state in international law. While the 1933 Montevideo Convention outlines criteria like territory, population, and government, recognition by other nations is practically crucial for a state to function on the world stage. The process for UN membership is also politically fraught, often blocked by permanent Security Council members, leaving some widely recognized territories like Palestine and Kosovo without full member status.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a major overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales, including mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70. The proposed road safety strategy could also see the drink-driving limit lowered to match Scotland's stricter standard and points issued for not wearing a seatbelt. The move follows a coroner's report that criticized the UK's current licensing system as the "laxest in Europe" after several deaths were caused by drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

          <p>Accommodation providers in Germany reported a record 223.3 million overnight stays in the first half of the year, despite a drop in foreign visitors. The new record was driven by a surge in domestic tourism, with German travelers accounting for over 80% of all bookings. The data highlights a strong trend of locals holidaying within the country, which more than compensated for the decline in international guests compared to the same period last year.</p>

          <p>Global long-only funds invested a net US$2.7 billion into Chinese stocks in July, marking the second straight month of net inflows and signaling renewed investor confidence. Analysts at Morgan Stanley predict this trend will strengthen, as China's stable economic growth and fairer valuations become more attractive. This shift comes as U.S.-China trade tensions ease and investors anticipate a weaker U.S. dollar, encouraging allocation into non-U.S. markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Everton is reportedly making progress in negotiations to sign Manchester City winger Jack Grealish on a season-long loan. The 29-year-old England international, who joined City for a record £100m fee, has fallen out of favor, making only seven league starts last season. A move to Everton would provide Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career and fight for a place back in the England squad after a difficult period at City.</p>

Grant, who started the chain in 1981, said this move preserves the family's legacy and the company's values better than a traditional sale would have.</p>
