          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 15:00:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive dust storm, known as a haboob, recently impacted the Phoenix area, causing travel disruptions and power outages for thousands. This article explains that haboobs are dust storms specifically triggered by outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm over dry, dusty regions. Originating from the Arabic word "habb" meaning "to blow," these phenomena significantly reduce visibility and increase wind speeds, posing hazards, especially for drivers. The National Weather Service advises motorists to pull off the road, turn off lights, and set emergency brakes if caught in such conditions.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has issued an apology to customers angered by its recent logo redesign but affirmed its decision to retain the new, simplified look. The updated logo, which removed the image of "Uncle Herschel" and the "Old Country Store" text, is part of a broader rebrand aimed at modernizing the chain and attracting new generations of customers. Despite criticism from social media users, including prominent political figures, and a dip in stock prices, the company emphasized its commitment to heritage while also evolving. Cracker Barrel stated it will continue to honor its traditions, including its vintage Americana decor and Uncle Herschel's presence on its menu.</p>

          <p>Pop superstar Taylor Swift's engagement announcement to Travis Kelce caused a brief but notable surge in shares for Signet Jewelers, a publicly traded jewelry retailer.

This event further highlights Swift's significant economic influence, following previous instances where her "Eras" tour generated consumer spending bumps acknowledged by Wall Street and the Federal Reserve.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a jump after President Donald Trump publicly weighed in on the controversy surrounding the restaurant chain's new logo. Trump suggested the company revert to its old logo, viewing the public outcry as a "great opportunity" for free publicity. His comments, echoed by his son Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives, followed a period where the company's stock had dropped after unveiling its simplified logo. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet, featuring a reimagined logo with Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully helped patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage trial. The drug's highest dose led to an average weight reduction of 10.5% over 72 weeks, also improving blood sugar levels. This success positions orforglipron as a promising, needle-free alternative in the growing GLP-1 market, potentially boosting supply and access to weight loss treatments.

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) against a high-yield savings account, offering insights for savers looking to protect and grow their money without stock market volatility. While CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed interest rate for a set term, high-yield savings accounts offer variable rates that can fluctuate. The analysis shows that depending on the term length, either option could yield slightly more interest, but the predictability of a CD's earnings often appeals to those prioritizing stability. Savers are advised to carefully consider their financial goals and liquidity needs before choosing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Italian master painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, stolen by Nazis over 80 years ago from a Jewish art dealer, has been located in an estate agent advertisement for a house in Argentina. The artwork, part of a database of lost wartime art, was traced to a property once owned by a senior Nazi official who fled to South America. Lawyers for the original art dealer's estate are now pursuing efforts to reclaim the painting, which was among more than 1,100 works acquired in a forced sale by high-ranking Nazis. This discovery marks a significant step in the ongoing quest to recover stolen cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>A Frankfurt court has ruled that Apple can no longer market its Apple Watch as "CO2-neutral" in Germany, finding the company misled consumers. The court sided with environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), stating that Apple's claims violated competition law. The ruling cited insufficient long-term guarantees for Apple's Paraguay reforestation project, which was used to offset emissions, noting that 75% of the leased land is not secured beyond 2029. This decision marks a victory against "greenwashing" and sets a precedent for corporate environmental claims in advertising.</p>

          <p>Despite strong performance by the S&P 500 index in 2025, investment experts are advising investors to diversify their portfolios due to concerns about narrow market growth. The "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks accounted for a disproportionate 26% of earnings growth, while the remaining 493 companies saw only 3% profit growth. This concentration, with the top 10 holdings representing 40% of the index, means S&P 500 investors are heavily exposed to tech and AI.
