          <p>In a guest essay for *The New York Times*, Harvard professor Steven Pinker critiques the "unhinged invective" aimed at Harvard University, which he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." Pinker, who has been critical of Harvard in the past, argues that the attacks, including those from President Trump, are disproportionate and harmful. He acknowledges Harvard's issues, such as the erosion of academic freedom and lack of viewpoint diversity, but contends that the university is not the "woke madrasa" its critics claim. Pinker advocates for a balanced approach to addressing Harvard's ailments, urging reform rather than outright destruction, and emphasizes the university's contributions to knowledge and innovation.</p>
