          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and to open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The agreement, reached after talks in Beijing, covers businesses allowed to export to China before the wastewater discharge and may take months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the left-wing presidential frontrunner in South Korea, has proposed amending the constitution to make it more difficult to impose martial law. This proposal aims to prevent political crises similar to the one that occurred after the short-lived martial law declaration by ousted conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol in December. Lee stated that he would seek to revise the constitution to strengthen martial law requirements, such as requiring parliamentary approval within 24 hours. Early voting turnout has been high, and Lee has also called for a special prosecutor to investigate the December 3 martial law incident.</p>

The competition came down to Zaki, Sarv Dharavane, and Sarvadnya Kadam, with Zaki ultimately prevailing after his competitors misspelled their words. Zaki's victory makes him the fifth runner-up to return and win the bee, and the first since 2001.</p>

          <p>Bernard Kerik, the former New York City Police Commissioner who served during the 9/11 terror attacks, has died at the age of 69. Kerik joined the NYPD in 1986 and served as commissioner under Mayor Rudy Giuliani from 2000 to 2001. He later faced legal troubles, pleading guilty to federal tax fraud and false statement charges in 2009, serving three years in prison before being pardoned by President Trump in 2020. Despite his later controversies, Kerik was remembered by many as a dedicated public servant who helped rebuild the city after 9/11.</p>
