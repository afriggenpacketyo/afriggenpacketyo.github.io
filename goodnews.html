          <h2>China to Resume Seafood Imports from Japan After Fukushima Water Discharge Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 23:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports set to resume once China completes its necessary procedures, which include Japan registering fishery processing facilities and confirming the absence of radioactive substances. China halted seafood imports in 2023, citing risks to the fishing industry and coastal communities. The resumption of imports indicates a potential easing of tensions between the two countries. The optimism score is fairly high due to the resolution of a trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is set to resume next month after crews reinforced tracks that were subject to landslides and coastal erosion.
