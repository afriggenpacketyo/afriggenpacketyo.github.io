          <p>Joe Mauer, a recent inductee into the Baseball Hall of Fame, discussed the significance of playing his entire 15-season MLB career with the Minnesota Twins. Mauer, a St. Paul native and the No. 1 overall pick in 2001, expressed gratitude for the opportunity to represent his hometown team. He acknowledged the rarity of such loyalty in modern baseball due to free agency and trades, while also admitting that his one career regret was not winning a World Series championship with the Twins. Mauer is set to participate in the American Century Championship golf tournament next month.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, according to Global Energy Monitor (GEM). The trend aims to advance the clean energy transition and potentially reduce a surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. China has 90 former coal mines operating as solar-power facilities, with additional projects in the planning stages. Outside China, other countries are also pursuing similar conversion projects, but most are still in early stages.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals applying for new or renewed passports to choose the gender they identify with, including selecting "X." The judge found that the Trump administration failed to provide a rationale for the policy and discriminated against transgender Americans. The Justice Department has appealed the ruling, but the policy's impact on transgender individuals' ability to travel has been acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall after lawmakers approved a budget without continued funding for the project. This shift comes after the state completed 65 miles of the wall, far short of the intended hundreds of miles. Governor Greg Abbott's office cited the federal government's renewed efforts to secure the border as the reason for the adjustment. The new budget allocates $3.4 billion for border security, primarily for the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard.</p>
