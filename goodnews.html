          <p>Both gold and bitcoin have recently surged to record prices, with investors seeking safe-haven assets amid growing economic and geopolitical instability. Gold surpassed $3,900 per troy ounce, while bitcoin broke the $125,000 barrier, driven by factors including the U.S. government shutdown, concerns over U.S. debt, and ongoing global conflicts. Analysts suggest that increased demand from institutional investors through ETFs and a favorable political climate for cryptocurrencies under the Trump administration are also contributing to the rally. Experts predict that both assets may continue to rise in value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has entered into a multi-billion dollar agreement with chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), causing AMD's stock to surge over 30%. The deal involves OpenAI deploying 6 gigawatts of AMD's AI accelerator chips over several years, significantly expanding its computing infrastructure. As part of the arrangement, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant that could allow it to acquire up to a 10% ownership stake in the company, contingent on deployment milestones. This partnership positions AMD as a key supplier for OpenAI, reducing its reliance on Nvidia and highlighting the interconnected AI corporate economy.</p>

          <p>Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell, and Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi have jointly won the 2025 Nobel Prize in medicine for their foundational discoveries related to peripheral immune tolerance. Their research identified a specific type of T cell, known as regulatory T cells (T-regs), and the gene Foxp3 that controls their development. These cells act as crucial guards that prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own tissues, a process that can lead to autoimmune diseases. Their work has opened a new field of immunology and is paving the way for potential new treatments for various conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for certificates of deposit (CDs), highlighting them as a tool for savers to combat inflation. While national average yields are around 1.7-2.0% APY, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs exceeding 4.25% APY. The report notes the presence of an "inverted yield curve," where short-term CDs currently offer better returns than long-term ones. To maximize earnings, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks and consider laddering CDs of various terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones anticipates that the stock market is primed for a significant rally before the current bull market ends in a "blow off" top. He draws parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1999, but notes that today's combination of loose fiscal and monetary policy is even more "potentially explosive." Jones advises that while there are substantial gains to be made in the final phase of a bull market, investors must be nimble to avoid the inevitable sharp correction that follows. He suggests a strategy of owning gold, cryptocurrencies, and Nasdaq tech stocks through the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent poll conducted by The Economist and YouGov indicates that late-night host Jimmy Kimmel has a higher favorability rating than President Donald Trump. The survey was conducted after Kimmel was temporarily suspended by ABC in September following pressure from the Trump administration, only to be reinstated after public outcry. Kimmel registered a net favorability of +3, while Trump had a net favorability of -13. The controversy began after the FCC chair threatened ABC's broadcast licenses over Kimmel's criticism of the administration, a move that sparked widespread debate about free speech.</p>

This community descends from Black Seminoles who escaped slavery in the 19th-century U.S. and established a free settlement in Coahuila, Mexico. The play, written by Miranda González, follows a modern-day Chicago teen who finds himself transported back to 1864, exploring themes of history, identity, and the search for freedom.

          <p>In her new book "Into the Weeds," author Lydia Davis reflects on the symbiotic relationship between reading and writing, suggesting that the act of writing is a way of learning how to read. The essay argues against the modern, algorithm-driven methods of book discovery, championing instead a more serendipitous and personal approach. Davis shares her own reading journey, moving from one book to another through loosely connected meanders and recommendations from friends. The book serves as a guide to rediscovering the joy of encountering the unexpected and the intimate connections that literature can foster.</p>
