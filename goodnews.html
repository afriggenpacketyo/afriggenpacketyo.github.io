          <p>Train services on Tokyo's busy Yamanote Line resumed Friday morning after being suspended due to issues with pantographs, which connect carriages to overhead power lines. The suspension caused significant disruptions for commuters as both inner and outer loops of the JR Yamanote Line, which encircles central Tokyo, were affected. Operations were halted to allow for thorough checks of equipment related to power supply to the carriages. The Keihin-Tohoku Line, which runs near the loop line, also experienced delays but resumed service in the morning.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1 in the U.S., linked to a surge in China. The variant has been detected in international travelers arriving at airports in several states, including California, Washington, and New York. Preliminary data suggests NB.1.8.1 may be more transmissible due to its ability to bind to human cells, though it doesn't appear to evade the immune system more effectively than other strains. Health authorities in Hong Kong and Taiwan have also reported increases in COVID-19 cases, prompting increased vigilance and preparations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in more than two years, primarily driven by increasing rice prices. This figure exceeded economists' expectations, prompting the Bank of Japan to consider pausing its rate hike strategy to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has expressed intentions to raise rates based on price trends, while also emphasizing the need to monitor the effects of U.S. tariffs. The core inflation rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years.</p>

          <p>Prince William has cited Sir David Attenborough as a major influence behind his new wildlife documentary series, Guardians, which highlights the work of rangers. The Prince of Wales emphasized the series aims to remind people of the planet's beautiful regions and ongoing conservation efforts. Guardians focuses on the increasingly dangerous work of rangers protecting endangered animals, with approximately 1,400 rangers having died in the past decade. Prince William hopes the series will raise awareness and encourage recruitment for these vital roles, stressing that protecting the natural world should not be a life-threatening job.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is resuming horse-drawn funeral carriages at Arlington National Cemetery in June 2025, following a suspension due to horse deaths in 2022.

Equestrian expert David O'Connor was brought in to assist, emphasizing the need for better understanding of the horses' needs. The program will now involve two squads of 11 horses performing two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week, with a focus on animal welfare and honoring service members.</p>

          <p>Bridget Brink, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, is contemplating a run for Congress in Michigan's 7th congressional district, a seat currently held by Republican Tom Barrett. Brink, a career diplomat, resigned her post as envoy to Ukraine due to policy differences with the Trump administration, particularly regarding pressure on Ukraine rather than Russia. She served as ambassador to Kyiv shortly after Russia's invasion in 2022 and remained in the role during the early months of the Trump administration. The Lansing-area district is considered a tossup, previously represented by Democrat Elissa Slotkin.</p>

The forecast is influenced by factors such as the neutral phase of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear.

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached record highs, with the average cost of ground beef increasing nearly 50% in the past five years.
