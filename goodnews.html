          <p>This article explores the potential earnings from investing $20,000 in a short-term Certificate of Deposit (CD). Short-term CDs, ranging from three to twelve months, offer savers the advantage of earning interest without locking up their funds for an extended period. The article provides calculations for potential earnings based on current interest rates, showing that a $20,000 investment could yield between $216 and $880 depending on the term length and interest rate. The piece also discusses alternative savings options, such as high-yield savings accounts, and highlights the benefits of CDs in a volatile market (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has pledged to meet NATO's defense spending target of 2% of GDP significantly earlier than previously planned, with Prime Minister Mark Carney announcing the goal would be achieved by March of next year. Carney cited the need to address multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals, as well as an aging military infrastructure. The new strategy involves increased investment in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying Canada's defense partnerships. This commitment includes a cash increase of C$9.3 billion for the current fiscal year.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump, along with several CEOs, is promoting savings plans for newborns, with Dell Technologies pledging to provide $1,000 for so-called Trump accounts for new children of its employees, matching the government's potential contribution. The savings account plan is part of a Republican-backed budget bill moving through Congress. Other CEOs, including those from Uber and Goldman Sachs, have expressed support for the initiative, although they did not make the same financial commitment as Dell. The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Merck's new shot, Enflonsia, to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), increasing competition with Sanofi and AstraZeneca's Beyfortus. Merck expects orders for Enflonsia to begin in July, with shipments before the next RSV season. The approval provides doctors with another option for preventing RSV, a leading cause of infant hospitalizations and deaths. The shot reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% in trials, and it can be administered regardless of an infant's weight.</p>

Despite this recent rally, Topgolf Callaway shares remain down for the year, highlighting a challenging period for the company.
