          <p>Chris Pratt debuted a rugged and unrecognizable appearance on Instagram, showcasing fake blood, a beard, and a mustache for his role as U.S. Navy SEAL James Reece in Amazon's "The Terminal List" season 2. Pratt praised his hair and makeup team for their incredible work, humorously noting the grossness of eating with a fake mustache or beard due to getting hair in his mouth. The actor also celebrated his sixth wedding anniversary with wife Katherine Schwarzenegger, expressing gratitude for the joy, family, and faith she brings into his life. Pratt's look signifies a gritty and intense role, contributing to the overall tone of the show.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The article emphasizes that tone of voice or attitude, which signals contempt, is a major predictor of divorce. Arguments about family often reflect unmet needs, while disputes over chores typically stem from an uneven distribution of labor and a lack of recognition for the "invisible load." Effective communication is crucial, with the "five-second rule" suggested for de-escalating tense conversations, and couples are encouraged to understand each other's perspectives before airing grievances. These insights provide practical advice for couples seeking to navigate conflicts and strengthen their relationships.</p>

          <p>England defeated West Indies in the second T20 match at Bristol, securing a series win with a superb chase of 197 runs. Jos Buttler's 47 and Harry Brook's 34 initially propelled England, but a late surge led by Jacob Bethell's explosive 26 off 10 balls and Tom Banton's unbeaten 30 off 11 sealed the victory with nine balls to spare. Earlier, West Indies had posted 196-9 after a late onslaught of 75 runs in the final four overs, following Luke Wood's early breakthrough and Shai Hope's elegant 49. Adil Rashid's expensive figures of 1-59 highlighted England's struggles in containing the West Indies' late-innings hitting, but England's batting depth ultimately secured the win.</p>
