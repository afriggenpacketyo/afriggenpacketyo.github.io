          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created an AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons. This design allows it to learn from less than 2% of the data required by conventional systems and run up to 100 times faster on certain long-text tasks. The system operates entirely on China's homegrown MetaX chip platform, a significant development as the U.S. restricts exports of advanced AI hardware like Nvidia's GPUs. This innovation underscores China's push for technological self-sufficiency in the critical field of artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Oracle's shares soared by 27% in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business, despite narrowly missing quarterly earnings and revenue estimates. The company reported a massive 359% increase in its remaining performance obligation, a measure of future contracted revenue, now totaling $455 billion. Key new contracts, including a significant deal with OpenAI and the integration of Google's Gemini models, are fueling investor confidence in Oracle's ability to compete in the AI-driven cloud market. The company forecasts substantial growth, aiming for $18 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in fiscal year 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's latest hardware event introduced the iPhone 17 lineup, highlighted by the new, ultra-thin iPhone Air model, which represents the first major redesign since 2017. While the new phones offer expected upgrades like better cameras and longer battery life, the event did not provide significant new details on the company's "Apple Intelligence" strategy. The company also implemented a new pricing structure, effectively increasing the average selling price by adjusting storage options for its Pro models. These updates are seen as sufficient to maintain consumer interest while Apple continues to develop its generative AI capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

Inspired by rocky road ice cream, the new offering will be a sandwich cookie with chocolate, marshmallow, and toasted almond-flavored crème. This addition comes as the organization retires two other flavors, S'mores and Toast-Yay!, resulting in a slightly smaller overall lineup for the upcoming year. The annual cookie sale is a key program for the youth organization, teaching members business skills and funding various activities.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming U.S. Inflation Reports Expected to Show a Rise in Prices for August</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 17:04:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation reports for August, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are anticipated to show a slight acceleration in prices, with economists forecasting a 0.3% monthly increase. This would push the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%, largely driven by price hikes on tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service-sector inflation. Despite the increase, analysts believe the Federal Reserve is still likely to proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are expected to focus on the weakening jobs market and view the tariff-related price jumps as temporary, one-off events. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its plans to remodel its restaurants, yielding to customer pressure just weeks after reversing a controversial logo change. The company had faced intense criticism from conservative customers and influencers who accused it of going "woke" for attempting to modernize its brand with a minimalist logo and contemporary interiors. In a statement, the chain acknowledged that the new design did not reflect what customers love about its "Old Country Store" aesthetic. This decision reinforces the company's return to its traditional branding after the attempted modernization effort was met with significant public disapproval.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was briefly detained by Los Angeles police following a dispute over a parking spot. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car, and he asked three women who parked very close to him to move their vehicle to avoid it getting wet. According to his agent, the women refused and began recording him, at which point Cruz turned with the hose, inadvertently splashing them. The women reported an assault, leading to his five-hour detention, but his agent expects the case to be dropped.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Geographic Disparities in Benefits from New Federal Tax Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 16:07:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law will result in varied benefits across the United States, with residents of some states receiving larger cuts than others. Residents in high-income states like Wyoming are projected to see the largest average tax reduction, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest. The disparity is driven by provisions that favor higher earners and business owners, as well as an increased cap on state and local tax deductions that benefits those in high-tax areas. The typical filer nationwide could see an average tax cut of $3,752 in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
