          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois for 14 days. The judge found the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of an "organized rebellion" to be unreliable, stating there was no credible evidence to justify military intervention. This ruling, celebrated by state and local leaders as a victory for the rule of law, directly challenges the president's authority to militarize cities against the will of local governments.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has halted the execution of Robert Roberson, who was convicted of murdering his two-year-old daughter in 2002. The stay was granted based on new arguments that the child's death was misdiagnosed as shaken baby syndrome, a hypothesis that has faced increasing scientific scrutiny. Roberson's defense presented expert testimony suggesting the child died from severe pneumonia, and the court will now review the case under a Texas law that allows convictions to be challenged if based on discredited science.</p>

          <p>A nearly complete fossil discovered on Dorset's Jurassic Coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a prehistoric marine reptile. Named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or "sword dragon of Dorset," the dolphin-sized creature lived approximately 185 million years ago and helps fill a significant gap in the evolutionary record of these animals. Analysis of the unique skeleton suggests the creature suffered from disease or injury during its life and may have been killed by a bite to the head from a larger predator.</p>

          <p>The newly released film "Tron: Ares" connects to the franchise's past while setting up future storylines through its ending and a mid-credits scene. The film concludes by hinting at a potential meeting between the new AI protagonist, Ares, and Quorra, a key character from 2010's "Tron: Legacy." Furthermore, a mid-credits scene reveals that the film's antagonist, Julian Dillinger, has escaped into the Grid and is shown adopting a digital suit reminiscent of Sark, the villain from the original 1982 "Tron" movie.</p>

          <p>California has officially banned the practice of declawing cats for non-medical reasons after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new bill into law. The procedure, which involves amputating the first bone of a cat's toes, is now only permitted when deemed a medical necessity to address a condition threatening the animal's health. Animal advocates and lawmakers who supported the bill described the practice as an inhumane and barbaric mutilation, making California the second state after New York to implement such a ban.</p>

          <p>The United States is sending approximately 200 troops to Israel to help support and monitor the newly approved ceasefire agreement with Hamas. These service members will operate a civil-military coordination center from within Israel, focusing on facilitating the flow of humanitarian aid, logistics, and security assistance into Gaza. Officials have stressed that no U.S. troops will enter Gaza, but their expertise will be crucial for managing the complex transition and ensuring the stability of the peace deal after two years of conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's Grammy-winning diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of inappropriate conduct, could not be considered defamatory because a reasonable listener would understand them as part of a rap battle, not as objective facts. Drake had alleged that UMG endangered him by releasing the song and that its promotion was intended to devalue his own music.</p>

          <p>California has enacted new laws aimed at cracking down on deceptive puppy sales and protecting consumers from misleading sellers. The legislation, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, bans online marketplaces where brokers resell dogs bred by others and requires sellers to disclose breeder details and medical histories. These measures were prompted by an investigation that found a network of resellers importing puppies from out-of-state commercial breeders while posing as small, local operators to circumvent state regulations.</p>

Exposure to natural environments can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, and decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. Inhaling organic compounds released by plants and soil, known as phytoncides, can also boost the immune system by increasing natural killer cells and introduce beneficial bacteria to the gut microbiome, which may help improve mood and fight disease.</p>
