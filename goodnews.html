          <p>Despite Amazon reporting better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and earnings, its stock fell after the company issued mixed third-quarter guidance. Investors expressed concern that growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) division was not as robust as that of its cloud rivals. However, this article argues the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the core drivers of the business, AWS and advertising revenue, remain strong and beat expectations. The analysis emphasizes that management often provides conservative guidance and that the long-term thesis for the company's growth and margin expansion is unchanged, reiterating a buy rating for the stock.

          <p>In a dramatic and rare event during the MLB trade deadline, Tampa Bay Rays infielder Jose Caballero was traded to the rival New York Yankees while the two teams were playing against each other. The news broke during a rain delay in the game, which the Yankees ultimately won. Following the announcement, cameras captured an emotional Caballero hugging his former Rays teammates in the dugout, with some appearing visibly stunned by the sudden move. Caballero is a significant acquisition for the Yankees, as he is currently tied for the MLB lead in stolen bases. The trade was one of several moves the Yankees made to bolster their roster before the deadline.</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled plans for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project long desired by President Donald Trump. The construction, estimated to cost $200 million, will be privately funded by President Trump and other anonymous donors, with work scheduled to begin in September. The new facility will be built alongside the East Wing and is designed to host large formal functions, such as state dinners, eliminating the need for temporary tents on the White House grounds. The current East Room has a much smaller capacity, and the administration states the new ballroom will be an 'exquisite addition' for future administrations to enjoy.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has disclosed that he was diagnosed with Lyme disease and struggled with its 'relentlessly debilitating' effects throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a candid social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the nerve pain, fatigue, and sickness he was experiencing on stage. Despite the physical and mental toll, he chose to continue the tour, viewing it as a test of his mental tenacity. Timberlake, who faced some criticism for low-energy performances, said he hopes to be more transparent about his struggles and thanked his family and fans for their support.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to increase social mobility and diversity within Whitehall, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will be restricted to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, the primary entry route into the civil service. This move is part of a broader government initiative to reform the civil service and create more career paths outside of London.</p>

          <p>Following its quarterly earnings report, Apple CEO Tim Cook addressed analyst questions by stating the company will 'significantly' increase its investments in artificial intelligence. Cook emphasized that Apple is 'very open' to mergers and acquisitions of any size that could accelerate its AI development, noting the company has already acquired around seven smaller firms this year. This commentary comes as Apple faces pressure to match the massive AI spending of competitors like Google and Microsoft. Cook positioned AI as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime and confirmed that Apple is reallocating internal resources to focus more heavily on developing personal and private AI features across its platforms.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers opted for a quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions rather than the blockbuster deals seen elsewhere in the league. The team acquired veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing key needs without giving up significant prospect capital. This conservative approach signals that the front office is maintaining faith in its current talented roster to defend its World Series title. While rivals like the San Diego Padres made major acquisitions, the Dodgers are betting that the return of injured players and improved performance from their existing stars will be sufficient for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting one last meal, with sales jumping dramatically. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, providing a temporary reprieve for the landmark establishment, which claims to have invented the French dip sandwich. While grateful for the surge in business, Moses noted it is likely not sustainable and is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the historic value of the city's oldest restaurant.</p>

Meanwhile, rival JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own '7Fresh' kitchens over the next three years.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve extending its pause on interest rate cuts, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a strategic decision. This article suggests that the current environment, with CD rates still attractively high, presents an ideal opportunity to renew or open a new CD account. While rate cuts are inevitable in the future, the current pause provides a window to lock in favorable rates, potentially for a long term, before banks begin to lower them in anticipation of future Fed action. Savers are advised to act promptly as their CDs mature to avoid automatic rollovers into potentially lower-rate accounts and to shop around for the best available offers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to continue its pause on interest rate cuts leaves many Americans with high-interest credit card debt in a difficult position. This article advises borrowers to take proactive steps rather than waiting for external economic changes to provide relief. It suggests borrowers should assess whether a minor rate cut would have made a significant difference and focus on creating a personal debt reduction plan, such as the debt snowball or avalanche method.

This article outlines five essential questions to ask before hiring such a service to avoid potential harm.

It is also important to verify the company's licensing and track record, understand the specific strategy they propose for your situation, and get a realistic timeline for the process.

          <p>Apple has reported impressive third-quarter earnings, with overall revenue growing 10% year-over-year, its largest increase since late 2021. The strong performance was largely fueled by a 13% rise in iPhone sales, which CEO Tim Cook attributed to the popularity of the iPhone 16 model. The Mac division also saw robust growth of nearly 15%. While the services business continued its steady climb, sales for the iPad and the wearables division both declined. The company also saw a reversal of recent trends in China, with sales in the region growing by 4%, providing a significant boost to the overall positive results.</p>

This highlights the intensifying competition in the cloud market as all three tech giants invest heavily in artificial intelligence.
