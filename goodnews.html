          <p>A brush fire on Maui forced the evacuation of about 50 residents, underscoring the island's vulnerability after the devastating 2023 Lahaina fire. The Kahikinui fire, estimated at 330 acres and 85% contained, is affecting a sparsely populated area with land set aside for Native Hawaiians. Meanwhile, wildfires are also raging in the Pacific Northwest, around the Great Basin, in California, and in the Rockies, prompting warnings from forecasters about escalating fire danger. The National Interagency Fire Center reports double the number of fires compared to last year, though the acreage is less. The situation highlights the ongoing challenges of managing wildfires amidst rising temperatures and drought conditions. </p>

          <p>Greta Thunberg, once criticized on Chinese social media, is now receiving support in China after her attempt to sail to Gaza was halted by Israeli forces. Her activism on environmental issues previously earned her the online label "the environmental girl."

Commenters on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, are expressing respect for her commitment and willingness to risk her life.

          <p>Vice President JD Vance defended President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict after criticism from supporters like Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon. Vance emphasized Trump's consistent stance that Iran cannot possess nuclear weapons and his efforts to achieve this goal through diplomacy. He acknowledged concerns about foreign entanglements but asserted that Trump prioritizes American interests. The defense comes as a divide grows among Trump's supporters regarding U.S. involvement, with some warning that further intervention could derail the president's domestic agenda. This situation highlights the complexities of balancing foreign policy objectives with domestic political considerations. </p>

          <p>Annual financial disclosures for Supreme Court justices reveal income from books and teaching positions. Justices Sotomayor, Gorsuch, and Jackson reported earnings from book royalties and advances, with Jackson earning $2 million from her memoir. Several justices disclosed teaching positions at law schools, including Chief Justice Roberts, who taught a course in Ireland. Justice Thomas reported no gifts, reimbursements, or outside income, but remains an honorary member of the Horatio Alger Association. The disclosures have received increased scrutiny following reports of luxury trips Thomas accepted from Harlan Crow, prompting calls for a code of conduct for the Supreme Court. </p>

          <p>The Senate's proposed tax bill includes a provision for a $1,000 "baby bonus" to be deposited into "Trump accounts" for children born between January 1, 2024, and December 31, 2028. To be eligible, the child must be a U.S. citizen at birth, and both parents must have Social Security numbers. The Trump accounts function similarly to 529 college savings plans, with tax-deferred earnings and qualified withdrawals taxed as long-term capital gains. Some experts criticize the accounts as overly complicated, while others see them as a way to introduce more Americans to wealth-building opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

The Endeavour, used by Cook for his voyages across the Pacific, was later used to transport British troops and detain prisoners during the American Revolutionary War. The ship was deliberately sunk in Newport Harbor in 1778. Efforts are underway to protect the wreck site due to its historical and cultural significance. </p>
