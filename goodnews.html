          <p>Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari expressed confidence for the British Grand Prix after a competitive showing in Friday's practice sessions at Silverstone. He finished third, closely behind McLaren's Lando Norris and his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc, despite McLaren and Red Bull introducing new upgrades. Hamilton noted he is feeling more comfortable with the car and believes a strong weekend is possible, especially with rain forecasted for qualifying and the race. The strong pace from Ferrari has positioned them as serious contenders against the championship-leading McLaren team for the upcoming race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An interventional cardiologist with over two decades of experience has outlined five types of food he avoids feeding his children to promote long-term heart health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, citing their role in inflammation and blood sugar issues. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>England staged a dramatic fightback on the third day of the second Test against India, led by Jamie Smith's spectacular unbeaten 184. After an early collapse left England in a precarious position, Smith and Harry Brook (158) formed a massive 303-run partnership to pull their team back into the match. However, India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj's six wickets, stormed back with the second new ball, causing a swift collapse of England's lower order. India ended the day with a commanding overall lead of 244, setting the stage for an exciting conclusion to the match.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the nation's 250th birthday, acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most pivotal events in world history. He argued that its greatest impact was the creation of the "citizen," a concept that replaced the universal status of being a subject under a ruler. Burns emphasized that while the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality did not initially include women, the poor, or non-white people, its inspirational words set in motion a global movement for rights and self-governance. He stressed the importance of embracing America's complex stories to fully understand its history.</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to combat the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, scientists are transplanting crossbred coral fragments onto a reef in Miami. The project, a collaboration between the University of Miami and other partners, uses corals crossbred from Florida and a warmer reef in Honduras. The goal is to introduce more heat-tolerant genetic diversity into Florida's iconic Elkhorn coral populations, which have been devastated by bleaching events caused by rising ocean temperatures. This marks the first time international crossbreeding has been permitted for planting on wild reefs, offering hope for their survival.</p>

He recounts the extensive forensic and oceanographic work required to locate wrecks and the powerful experience of exploring sites like the Titanic. Delgado reflected on the eerie moment of seeing his own reflection in a porthole 2.5 miles below the surface, on a ship he describes as a stage for powerful human drama.</p>

          <p>Germany's decision to significantly increase its defense spending has sparked a debate among economists about its potential impact on the broader economy. While arms manufacturers like Rheinmetall have seen their stock prices and order backlogs soar, some economists are skeptical that this will translate into substantial overall growth. A study suggests that military spending has a lower economic multiplier effect compared to investments in infrastructure or education. Critics warn that the spending may primarily boost arms companies' profits rather than Germany's defense capabilities or overall economic output. (not investment advice)</p>
