          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded to a personal letter she sent concerning Ukrainian children displaced by the war. She stated that her communication resulted in eight children being reunited with their families, a fact she says the U.S. government has confirmed. The "peace letter" was part of her BE BEST initiative, which focuses on the well-being of children globally. This development marks a rare point of direct, publicly acknowledged communication between the First Lady and the Russian leader on a humanitarian issue.</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. These changes are designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets even if their real income hasn't increased. The adjustments will affect millions of Americans, altering how much they owe in taxes. The announcement also included updated figures for the Earned Income Tax Credit and other provisions, providing clarity for financial planning ahead of the next tax season.

          <p>The White House expressed disappointment after President Trump was not awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, accusing the committee of prioritizing politics over peace. In a notable turn, the 2025 laureate, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, publicly thanked President Trump for his "decisive support" for her cause, dedicating the prize in part to him. The president, who has long maintained he deserves the award for his foreign policy actions, reportedly called Machado to congratulate her. This created a unique situation where the prize winner acknowledged the very person whose administration was criticizing the committee's choice.</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially begun, with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirming that its troops are repositioning along newly agreed-upon lines within the Gaza Strip. This initial phase is a critical step in a broader agreement that includes the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. The successful redeployment of IDF forces, who will still control over half of Gaza, triggers a 72-hour countdown for the hostage and prisoner exchange to be completed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a climate of falling interest rates, the monthly cost of a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. A $200,000 HELOC currently carries an average interest rate of 7.84%, resulting in estimated monthly payments between roughly $1,890 and $2,410, depending on the repayment term. This represents a significant decrease in cost compared to the previous year. The article notes that while variable rates introduce uncertainty, the Federal Reserve's current rate-cutting trend suggests these costs could decline further for borrowers.
