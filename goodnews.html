          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 19:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has been temporarily spared from President Donald Trump's executive order doubling tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%. The exemption is contingent on the US-UK Economic Prosperity Deal (ECD) signed in May, which aims to eliminate these tariffs. However, the UK could face the increased tariff if the ECD is not implemented or if the US determines the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the agreement. Uncertainty remains regarding the timing and final tariff rates, potentially impacting UK steel exports to the US. </p>

Despite other contenders, Smith was the obvious choice, embodying the team's "Bazball" approach. Smith's ability to put pressure on the best balls was evident in his high strike-rate and run-scoring. England's fascination with Smith comes with the knowledge that at his best he can seemingly do it all in the sport of cricket. </p>
