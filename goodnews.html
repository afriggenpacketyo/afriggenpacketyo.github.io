          <p>A recent Fidelity Investments report indicates that the average 401(k) balance decreased by 3% in the first quarter of 2025, settling at $127,100, while IRA balances also fell by 4% to $121,983 due to market volatility. Despite these declines, both 401(k) and IRA balances showed year-over-year growth, with the majority of retirement savers continuing to contribute. The average 401(k) contribution rate rose to 14.3%, nearing Fidelity's suggested 15% savings rate, as experts advise maintaining a long-term investment strategy to weather market fluctuations and avoid short-term reactions. According to financial advisors, trying to time the market often leads to losses, and investors should focus on the long-term benefits of staying invested in volatile assets.

          <p>Vietnam has officially ended its two-child policy, which had been in place since 2009 to prevent overpopulation, due to concerns about declining birth rates and a shrinking working-age population. The new amendments to the Population Law give families the freedom to decide how many children they wish to have. The Ministry of Health estimates Vietnam's population to be just over 100 million, but the national fertility rate dropped to 1.91 per woman in 2024, below the replacement level. Lawmakers are also addressing sex imbalances caused by prenatal gender selection, proposing increased fines for pre-birth sex selection.</p>

          <p>While making on-time debt payments is crucial for your credit score, it is not the only factor that determines a high score, as not all debt payments are reported to credit bureaus. Payments such as rent-to-own, private school tuition, utilities, and some buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans may not influence your credit score, as they are not always reported. Checking your credit report can help identify which payments are affecting your score. Maintaining low credit utilization and having a mix of credit accounts are also important for improving your credit score. (not investment advice)</p>

McCook was credited with saving the life of Sgt. John Boyd, who survived the crash after McCook maneuvered the damaged plane to allow Boyd to parachute out. McCook's remains were not recovered until 1947, and were interred as "Unknowns" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific until recently. Through dental, anthropological, and DNA analyses, the DPAA identified one of the sets of remains as belonging to McCook, and he will be buried in his hometown in August 2025.</p>

          <p>The average 401(k) savings rate has reached a new record high, with the combined employee and company contributions rising to 14.3% in the first quarter of 2025, according to Fidelity's quarterly analysis. Employees deferred a milestone 9.5% into 401(k) plans, and companies contributed 4.8%, bringing the rate closer to Fidelity's recommended 15% savings target. The increased employee deferrals were largely driven by "auto-escalations," which automatically boost savings rates over time, and advisors suggest saving at least enough to get the full employer 401(k) matching contribution. While experts recommend saving at least 15% of pre-tax income each year, the ideal percentage depends on individual circumstances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has indicated that a trade deal struck with the US last month could be implemented soon, as the White House signaled that the UK would be spared from the 50% steel and aluminum tariffs. Donald Trump decided to "provide different treatment" to the UK after the deal was agreed upon, though it is yet to be signed, and Starmer hopes it will be implemented quickly. While levies will remain at 25% for imports from Britain, the higher 50% could be imposed if the US administration determines that the UK has not complied with relevant aspects of the deal. Industry bodies have welcomed the decision to keep tariffs at 25% but emphasize the need for the UK government to finalize the trade deal to remove tariffs altogether.</p>

Senator James Risch addressed these reports, stating that conflicts are common for those who own land within publicly owned areas. Boren said he feels some of the disagreements have been "oppressive" but that resolutions were reached, and he is committed to making forest management more resilient and healthy.</p>

The star, TOI-6894, is a small red dwarf with only 20% of the mass of our sun, and it was not thought possible for such a small star to host a giant planet. The planet, TOI-6894b, has a slightly larger radius than Saturn but only half its mass, orbiting its star in a little over three days. Scientists are intrigued by the planet's unusually cold temperature and are planning to use the James Webb space telescope to uncover more mysteries.</p>
