          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 20:40:17 EDT</div>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to his Scottish golf courses provided UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer with significant, informal access to the U.S. leader. The trip, though notionally private, involved public appearances and a lengthy, wide-ranging press conference covering topics from Gaza to trade. This direct engagement is viewed by Downing Street as invaluable for strengthening the UK-US relationship, despite the unpredictable nature of the president's public statements. For Starmer, the visit offered a chance to align on key issues like the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to burnish a crucial diplomatic relationship ahead of a formal state visit.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, Waymo, has announced plans to expand its robotaxi service to Dallas, Texas, starting in 2026. The company has partnered with Avis Budget Group, which will manage the fleet of driverless vehicles in the new market. Waymo is already conducting tests with its Jaguar I-PACE electric vehicles in downtown Dallas, and the service will be accessible to passengers through the Waymo app. This expansion marks another step in Waymo's growth, as it already operates in cities like Los Angeles and Phoenix and plans further rollouts in Miami and Washington, D.C., solidifying its lead in the U.S. autonomous vehicle market.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders has revealed he was diagnosed with bladder cancer but is now considered cancer-free following treatment. During a press conference with his medical team, his doctor confirmed that the high-grade tumor required the removal of his bladder and the creation of a new one. An emotional Sanders expressed his gratitude and stated he never questioned "why me," hoping his journey would encourage others to schedule health checkups. The announcement clarified speculation about his health after a prolonged public absence, and he confirmed he will continue coaching the team.</p>

          <p>To improve access to some of its most popular camping spots, California State Parks is introducing a lottery-style drawing system for reservations at Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls state parks. The new system aims to level the playing field for coveted campsites that previously would be booked within minutes of becoming available. Would-be campers can enter a drawing for free, with unsuccessful applicants receiving points to increase their chances in future lotteries. This change is part of a broader effort to reduce no-shows and make the state's most sought-after outdoor destinations more accessible to the public.</p>

          <h2>Market Analyst Explains Lack of Rally Following New US Trade Deals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 19:35:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's muted reaction to the new U.S.-EU trade deal is due to investors being preoccupied with more immediate concerns. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on upcoming Big Tech earnings reports, a pivotal Federal Reserve meeting, and forthcoming employment data, which overshadow the tariff announcements. Cramer also points to a sense of "tariff ennui," as investors have seen this pattern before where high tariff threats are negotiated down, and major trade deals with other partners like China are still pending. The market is not expected to react significantly to trade policy until these other major economic events have passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a July slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire an outfielder who can provide a significant defensive upgrade, with Minnesota Twins' Harrison Bader emerging as a prime target. While the Dodgers' offense has struggled, the team's priority may be shifting to run prevention to support a potentially dominant playoff pitching staff. Bader, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, could anchor the outfield defense and allow other players to move to more suitable positions. This potential move signals the team's focus on shoring up all facets of their game ahead of the trade deadline for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>Roy Cooper, the former two-term Democratic governor of North Carolina, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in 2026. He is seeking to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis. In his announcement video, Cooper framed his campaign as a fight to preserve the American middle class, criticizing D.C. politicians for favoring corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working families. His campaign reported raising $1 million within hours of the launch, and his entry into the race is seen by national Democrats as a strong opportunity to flip the Senate seat.</p>
