          <p>Chinese tech firm Honor has launched its new Magic V5 foldable smartphone, notable for being one of the thinnest on the market.

          <p>Australia has revoked the entry visa for the American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, due to his pro-Nazi song titled "Heil Hitler." Immigration Minister Tony Burke confirmed the decision, stating that Australia does not need to import bigotry and hatred, especially Nazism. The song, which contains antisemitic lyrics and samples a Hitler speech, has already been banned on several platforms. This action follows a history of antisemitic remarks from Ye, and while the ban is not permanent, any future visa applications will be reassessed by officials.</p>

          <p>There has been a significant increase in U.S. citizens applying for New Zealand's Active Investor Plus visa, often called a "golden visa," following a relaxation of its rules. In less than three months, 189 applications were received, with nearly half from Americans, a stark increase from the 116 applications over the previous two and a half years. Experts attribute this trend to global uncertainty, including political polarization in the U.S., positioning New Zealand as a safe haven. The country's appeal is enhanced by its stable banking system and lack of certain wealth taxes.</p>

This focus highlights the sector's growing role in China's overall economic strategy. The government aims to accelerate growth in various marine industries, which are now considered to be entering a pre-boom phase of development.</p>

The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, prompting more homeowners, particularly those with larger loans, to seek savings.

Her food truck, which was her entire livelihood, was illegally towed in 2022 from an empty lot with no warning signs. Instead of paying the company's demands, she filed a complaint with the Attorney General, leading to a jury awarding her $6.9 million in punitive damages and $200,000 in compensatory damages. The verdict sends a strong message of accountability to the towing industry, and the company involved appears to have since shut down.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. While Israel has not officially confirmed the agreement, its foreign minister indicated majority government support for a framework to release hostages. A Hamas official stated the group is ready to agree if the proposal leads to a complete end to the war. The announcement puts pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has long insisted on "complete victory" before ending hostilities.</p>
