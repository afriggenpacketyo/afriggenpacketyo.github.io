          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the men's doubles title at Wimbledon in 89 years. They secured a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) victory over Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in the final. The win marks the first time two Britons have been crowned men's doubles champions at any Grand Slam since 1936. This achievement was a stated goal for the pair, who only teamed up less than a year ago after their previous partners won the same title in 2024.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. This dominant performance, known as a "double bagel," was the first in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911. While the 24-year-old Swiatek drew on her Grand Slam experience to master the grass court, Anisimova struggled with nerves in her first major final appearance. The win marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman to win majors on all three surfaces since Serena Williams.</p>

          <p>A new solar-powered robot is being deployed in California cotton fields to combat weeds without using chemical herbicides. Developed by Aigen, the Element robot uses artificial intelligence and cameras to identify and mechanically remove weeds while leaving crops unharmed. The technology aims to provide a sustainable alternative for farmers facing labor shortages and growing herbicide resistance in weeds. By running entirely on solar power, the robot reduces both environmental impact and fuel costs, and it is also being adapted for use in soy and sugar beet fields.</p>

          <p>An Avro Lancaster bomber from the RAF's Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) experienced an engine problem during a families' day event at RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire. The crew of the iconic World War II aircraft diagnosed unusual engine behavior and safely returned to its base at RAF Coningsby as a precautionary measure. No one was injured in the incident, and the RAF has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the issue. This specific aircraft, PA474, is one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world, making its preservation a high priority.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada, the U.S. stock market has shown surprising stability, with major indices remaining near record highs. Analysts suggest that investors have become more accustomed to the administration's negotiation tactics, leading to less panic compared to previous tariff announcements earlier in the year. The market's focus appears to be on long-term growth drivers like artificial intelligence and deregulation, which are seen as offsetting the immediate risks posed by the escalating trade disputes.</p>

They have formally notified the Education Secretary of their intent to seek a judicial review.

          <p>Amid rising trade war uncertainty, U.S. companies are increasingly using government-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce tariff payments. These zones allow businesses to import components and assemble products in a duty-free bubble, with taxes only collected when the final goods enter U.S. commerce. This strategy helps preserve cash flow, a critical concern for companies impacted by tariffs. However, a recent executive order has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, which allowed companies to pay a lower duty on the finished product, creating new challenges for manufacturers.</p>
