          <p>Following a talismanic performance in a World Cup qualifying win against Slovakia, Northern Ireland's captain Conor Bradley will miss the upcoming crucial match against Germany. The Liverpool defender received what his manager described as a harsh yellow card, leading to a suspension. This absence creates a significant challenge for manager Michael O'Neill, who must now find a way to compensate for the loss of his most influential player against the group favorites. The team faces the difficult task of adapting its strategy without its key driving force.</p>

          <p>World football's governing body, FIFA, is actively redrafting its regulations and seeking legal advice on whether it can ban domestic league games from being staged in foreign countries. This review was prompted by recent decisions to allow top-tier Spanish and Italian league matches to be played in the United States and Australia. The current rules, written in 2014, are seen as inadequate for the modern globalized game, and FIFA aims to establish a more robust and clear-cut framework despite potential legal challenges related to anti-trust laws.</p>

The directive encourages the use of AI for beneficial public services like online consultations, infrastructure monitoring, and administrative assistance to improve efficiency. However, it mandates that all models undergo a complete safety evaluation before deployment, reflecting Beijing's strategy to harness AI technology while maintaining strict control over government information security.</p>

          <p>As part of its 'health silk road' initiative, China is increasing its investment in Africa's pharmaceutical sector to help the continent reduce its reliance on imported medicines. Chinese companies are set to build an insulin production plant in Nigeria and are constructing a facility in the Ivory Coast to manufacture antimalarial and antibacterial drugs. These projects are designed to fill critical gaps in local manufacturing capabilities, addressing Africa's significant disease burden while simultaneously strengthening economic and diplomatic ties between China and African nations.</p>

          <p>A political debate is underway in Germany regarding the potential criminalization of verbal sexual harassment, often referred to as 'catcalling.'

While some European neighbors have already passed similar laws, the proposal has met resistance from coalition partners who question its practicality, leading to a wider national discussion on how to legally address street harassment.</p>
