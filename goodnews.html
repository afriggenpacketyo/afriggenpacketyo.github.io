          <p>A powerful 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The event initially triggered a tsunami advisory for Alaska's Aleutian Islands, which was later canceled. Russian officials in the Kamchatka region also issued a local tsunami warning, urging residents to be aware of the danger. Fortunately, there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the seismic event, and authorities confirmed no tsunami threat to Hawaii or Canada.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, joined by seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation Entertainment, alleging illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies have tacitly collaborated with scalpers, allowing them to unlawfully acquire large quantities of tickets, which drives up prices for consumers. The FTC accuses Ticketmaster of "triple dipping" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets, costing fans millions. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson stated the goal is to secure an injunction to stop these practices and protect consumers from unfair pricing.</p>

          <p>Leading chipmaker Nvidia has announced a landmark $5 billion investment in Intel, coupled with a strategic collaboration to develop products for AI data centers and personal computers. This partnership follows the Trump administration's recent acquisition of a 10% stake in the struggling semiconductor giant. The collaboration will see the two companies work to seamlessly connect their respective technologies, with Intel producing custom chips for Nvidia's AI platforms. The move is seen as a significant lifeline for Intel, which has fallen behind in the AI era, and aims to strengthen the US semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK suggests that while the personal relationship between the president and Prime Minister Keir Starmer appears warm, Britain's ability to influence U.S. policy remains minimal. Trump was reportedly more impressed by the royal pageantry at Windsor Castle than the political talks at Chequers. Despite an amicable joint news conference where major disagreements were downplayed, key policy differences on issues like Palestinian statehood remain unchanged. According to the White House chief of staff, the visit will have "none at all" impact on US policy, indicating that cordiality has not translated into increased diplomatic leverage for the UK.</p>
