          <p>South Korean AI chip developer Rebellions has secured a new investment from Samsung as it pursues a larger funding round of up to $200 million. The startup, which resulted from a merger with Sapeon, aims to challenge Nvidia in the AI inference chip market. This funding will support the development and large-scale production of its next-generation 'Rebel' chip, which Samsung will manufacture using its advanced 4-nanometer process. The move is part of Rebellions' broader strategy to go public and expand its global presence, representing a potential strategic win for Samsung's foundry business.</p>

          <p>In the first half of 2025, passenger volumes at Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport and Shenzhen's Baoan Airport surpassed their pre-pandemic highs, indicating a strong recovery in the region. Guangzhou handled over 40 million passengers, a 9.2% year-on-year increase, while Shenzhen served nearly 32.6 million, up 10.8%. This growth, attributed to vibrant business activity and tourism, contrasts with Hong Kong International Airport, which remains below its 2019 traffic levels despite a significant year-on-year increase. The trend highlights shifting aviation dynamics within China's Greater Bay Area.</p>

          <h2>Public Displays of Affection by Film Co-Stars Analyzed as a Movie Promotion Tactic</h2>

          <p>The recent handsy and flirtatious behavior between 'Fantastic Four' stars Pedro Pascal and Vanessa Kirby is part of a common Hollywood trend where co-stars use public displays of affection to generate buzz for their films. While Pascal has attributed his physical touch to a coping mechanism for anxiety, public relations experts suggest such actions are often a calculated tactic to build interest and drive ticket sales. This strategy has been employed by other famous pairs, including Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Bailey. Experts note that while it can be effective, the tactic risks backfiring if the behavior is perceived as inappropriate or inauthentic.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has announced plans to tighten oversight of key manufacturing sectors, including electric vehicles and solar power, to address excessive competition. The ministry intends to use upgraded standards to phase out outdated production capacity and regulate what it calls 'neijuan,' or cut-throat internal competition. This move is part of a broader government effort to stabilize key industries that have been struggling with overcapacity and price wars. The initiative aims to promote healthier development and focus on hi-tech consumer goods to help revive domestic demand.</p>

          <p>World Rugby's chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has rejected claims by Australia coach Joe Schmidt that a crucial refereeing decision in the second Test against the British and Irish Lions undermined player welfare. The controversy surrounds a clearout by flanker Jac Morgan in the build-up to the Lions' match-winning try, which Schmidt argued was dangerous. Gilpin defended the on-field officials, stating they followed the correct process and that the organization is heavily invested in balancing the game's physicality with player safety. He emphasized that while officials don't get every call right, they must be supported.</p>

          <p>Google is rolling out its new 'AI Mode' search feature in the UK, marking a significant change for its search engine. This optional tool will provide users with conversational, AI-generated answers instead of the traditional list of blue links. The feature, powered by Google's Gemini platform, aims to handle more complex, natural language queries. However, the shift is raising concerns among publishers and businesses who rely on search traffic for revenue, as AI-generated summaries may reduce the need for users to click through to external websites. The new model's impact on advertising revenue is still being finalized.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent EU-US trade agreement, which sets a 15% tariff on EU goods imported to the US, could inadvertently benefit the United Kingdom. With the UK facing a lower 10% tariff rate, its exports to the US become relatively cheaper, potentially boosting trade as American firms and consumers may favor British products over those from the EU. Some experts suggest this could incentivize EU companies to shift manufacturing to the UK to avoid the higher levy. While the actual impact remains to be seen, the tariff differential presents a potential competitive advantage for the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to a report from Canalys. In the second quarter of 2025, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% a year prior, with shipment volumes soaring by 240%. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties. In contrast, China's share of U.S. smartphone imports fell to 25% from 61% a year earlier, reflecting a significant realignment of global technology supply chains.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays exceeded second-quarter profit expectations, reporting a pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, and announced a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was driven by its investment banking division, where income rose 10% year-on-year to £3.3 billion. Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from increased market volatility related to U.S. tariff policies, which boosted trading income. The results come as the bank continues to implement a three-year strategic plan under CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan, which includes cost reductions and a focus on improving returns for investors.</p>

The club acknowledges the need to sell some current players first to fund any new arrivals. Securing either player presents challenges, as Aston Villa is reluctant to sell the 29-year-old Watkins, and United faces competition from Newcastle for the 22-year-old Slovenian, Sesko. The club feels Villa's stance on Watkins might soften closer to the transfer deadline, though his reported £60m price tag is considered high.</p>
