          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit as a car manufacturer in Argentina, signaling a potential move into vehicle production in the South American market. The legal filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina S.A.U. to manufacture, import, and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts. This development follows the company's previous investment in an electric bus plant in 2017 and its stated plans for regional expansion. If production begins, this would mark BYD's second vehicle factory in Latin America, further solidifying its presence in the global EV market.</p>

The outbreak primarily impacted school-aged children, leading to 99 hospitalizations and two deaths. While the immediate crisis is over, health authorities urge continued vigilance and vaccination, as the threat of reintroduction from ongoing global outbreaks remains a significant concern for public health.</p>

          <p>Major food service chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new beverage offerings to attract customers, particularly from Gen Z. Driven by a demand for customized, cold, and flavorful drinks, companies are expanding their menus with items ranging from sweet refreshers to protein-infused cold foams. Market data indicates a shift where consumers are increasingly visiting establishments specifically for a beverage, rather than as a food add-on. As chains face a challenging consumer environment, these innovative and often higher-margin drink options are seen as a key strategy to reverse sales slumps and drive growth.</p>

          <p>In a well-attended match at the US Open, the high-profile mixed doubles team of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz were defeated by Jessica Pegula and Jack Draper. The event, part of a reimagined mixed doubles format with a shortened structure and a $1 million prize, took place in a festive atmosphere on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Despite being the crowd favorites, Raducanu and Alcaraz lost 4-2 4-2 to their more experienced doubles opponents. The new format aims to attract top singles players by scheduling the tournament before the main draws begin, though it has drawn some criticism from doubles specialists.</p>

          <p>Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban advises that aggressively investing money is a more effective strategy for building wealth than simply saving it. He points out that the wealthiest individuals do not let their money sit in savings accounts but actively invest in assets like real estate and alternative investments. While maintaining an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses is crucial, long-term financial goals are better served by investing in the stock market. The article illustrates that historical market returns significantly outpace the yields from savings accounts, potentially leading to millions in missed gains over time. (not investment advice)</p>

The announcement comes as the White House is reportedly discussing a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Lutnick suggested that similar equity arrangements could be pursued with other recipients of CHIPS Act funding to ensure taxpayers benefit from the investment in domestic manufacturing.
