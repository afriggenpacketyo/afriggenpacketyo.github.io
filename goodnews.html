          <p>General Motors has announced plans to expand its production of popular gasoline-powered vehicles, shifting manufacturing of the Cadillac Escalade SUV to its Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. The facility will also begin producing Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks in early 2027 to meet strong consumer demand. This move represents a significant investment in GM's traditional vehicle lineup, notably at a plant that was previously expected to be dedicated exclusively to electric vehicle production.</p>

          <p>In a notable collaboration between rivals, Amazon is set to launch its next group of Project Kuiper internet satellites aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. This partnership highlights the intense pressure Amazon faces to deploy its satellite constellation, as it must have roughly 1,600 satellites in orbit by July 2026 to meet FCC requirements. The mission underscores the competitive landscape of the satellite internet market, dominated by SpaceX's Starlink, and the broader space-related rivalry between billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia, reportedly reducing planned U.S. tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19%. In exchange, President Trump stated that the U.S. will gain "full access" to Indonesian markets and that the country has committed to purchasing billions in American energy and agricultural products, as well as 50 Boeing jets. This deal is the latest in a series of negotiations following widespread tariff threats issued by the White House, although Indonesian officials have not immediately confirmed the terms.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices announced it will soon resume exporting its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, pending the approval of license applications by the U.S. Commerce Department. The news, which caused AMD's stock to rise, follows similar developments from competitor Nvidia and indicates a shift in the Trump administration's policy on AI chip exports. This change comes after lobbying from the chip industry to ease restrictions, which had been implemented over national security concerns and had impacted revenues for major U.S. tech firms.

In a key speech, she argued that the focus has been too heavily on risks rather than potential benefits, and that a complex guidance system prevents savers from getting proper support. The government is now consulting with regulators to introduce new targeted support for consumers, aiming to encourage more people to invest their savings, including some of the £300 billion currently held in cash ISAs.</p>
