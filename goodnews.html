          <p>Philadelphia Phillies slugger Kyle Schwarber achieved a rare feat in baseball history by hitting four home runs in a single game against Atlanta. His performance, which included a team-record nine RBIs, makes him the 21st player in MLB history to accomplish this and the first Phillie to do so since Mike Schmidt in 1976. The impressive display of power also propelled Schwarber into the lead for the National League home run title with 49 and brought him to the top of the MLB for RBIs with 119.</p>

The meeting with President Xi Jinping comes as both nations face economic pressure from U.S. tariffs, potentially pushing them toward reluctant cooperation despite deep-seated suspicions and ongoing border disputes. While experts do not foresee a long-term friendship, the visit signals a willingness to find common ground, driven by mutual economic interests and complex dependencies in sectors like pharmaceuticals and electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists in the UK are analyzing the DNA of ancient oak trees, some as old as 800 years, to understand the genetic basis for their remarkable longevity and resilience to threats like climate change and disease. The project, led by charities The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association, aims to identify genetic markers associated with survival. This knowledge could be crucial for selecting the most robust saplings for future planting, helping to restore Britain's depleted woodlands and support the vast ecosystems that depend on these iconic trees.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service will begin offering a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England and Wales starting in January 2026. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab, and a catch-up program is planned for slightly older children. Previously available only through private payment, this move is expected to protect children from rare but severe complications of the virus. It also aims to reduce the economic impact on families by preventing parents from needing to take time off work to care for sick children.</p>

Cramer suggested that trading in and out of such foundational stocks leads to missed opportunities, and that trusting the market and the long-term vision of innovative companies is crucial for significant financial gains.
