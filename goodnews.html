          <p>HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced that faith is integral to government operations at the agency's first faith-based disaster recovery event on the National Mall. This event, featuring worship leader Sean Feucht, signals a significant shift in how the federal government engages with Christian organizations, acknowledging their critical role in post-disaster recovery efforts. Turner highlighted that these groups are often the first responders, breathing new life into devastated communities by building homes, converting places of worship into emergency centers, and supporting small businesses. For Feucht, whose "Let Us Worship" movement previously clashed with left-leaning governments over restrictions, this federally recognized gathering marked a dramatic transformation, symbolizing a new era of collaboration between faith-based initiatives and national leadership.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka clinched her second consecutive US Open title by defeating Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) in a hard-fought final at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The world No. 1 showcased remarkable composure, overcoming moments of self-doubt and the pressure of previous Grand Slam final losses earlier in 2025. This victory marks her fourth major trophy, all achieved on hard courts, making her the first woman since Serena Williams (2012-14) to secure back-to-back Flushing Meadows titles. Despite a strong challenge from the American eighth seed, Anisimova, and an enthusiastic home crowd, Sabalenka maintained a steadier level, dominating the tie-break to seal her triumph and cement her status as a dominant force in women's tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Schools across the United States are increasingly adopting Yondr locked magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans, aiming to reduce classroom distractions and enhance student engagement. This system, now used by millions of students in 35 states, requires students to secure their phones in a pouch that can only be unlocked at designated school exits. While some students initially resisted or tried to circumvent the pouches, many educators, like Yonkers Middle High School principal Dr. Sandy Hattar, report positive outcomes, including more active student participation and face-to-face conversations. The initiative seeks to create a culture change, allowing students to experience life outside a constant digital realm, despite debates over the cost and implementation challenges.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.8 billion for Saturday night's drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This colossal sum, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million before taxes, now ranks as the second-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the world-record $2.04 billion jackpot won in November 2022. This drawing marks the 42nd consecutive one without a jackpot winner, tying the game's record for the longest streak. With odds of 1 in 292.2 million, a single winner could choose between the annuity option or a substantial lump sum payment, fueling widespread excitement across the 45 participating states.

          <p>The recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin marked a significant diplomatic triumph for President Xi Jinping, as China leveraged the platform to articulate its vision for a multipolar international order. Beijing aimed to burnish its geopolitical profile as a reliable interlocutor and an alternative voice for stability in global governance, particularly amidst perceived US credibility issues under President Trump. The China-led SCO, a Eurasian institution comprising 10 members including Russia, India, Iran, and Belarus, prioritizes counter-terrorism and economic integration, notably China’s Belt and Road Initiative. A key moment, capturing Xi in bonhomie with Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, underscored a symbolic challenge to Western dominance and hinted at evolving international alignments.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received a special gift package and met outfielder Harrison Bader after an adult fan controversially took a home run ball from him during a game. Video footage showed a woman, dubbed "Phillies Karen," berating the boy's father, who had initially given his son the ball, and claiming it was hers before taking it. Although it's unclear if the ball was truly in her possession, the incident went viral. The Marlins and Phillies organizations responded by gifting the boy team swag and arranging a meet-and-greet with Bader, who also gave him an autographed bat, turning a disappointing moment into a memorable one.</p>

At its recent conference, the party highlighted hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with their old party. Reform UK seeks to gain more seats in councils and parliaments, with national opinion polls suggesting this ambition is not unrealistic. Farage called for 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections, signaling a rigorous selection process to build a "people's army" and avoid past campaign scandals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former British Army officer who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to provide support and recognition for female military veterans, particularly those working in healthcare. She highlights that women veterans often face unique challenges, including isolation and misconceptions about their front-line roles, leading them to avoid traditional veterans' spaces. The community interest company, with 160 members, offers a "cathartic" network through meetings and activities, helping women discuss shared experiences and overcome the mental load of military service and demanding civilian roles. This initiative aims to break down barriers and encourage women to seek the support they need.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with a canonization ceremony led by Pope Leo on Sunday. Baptized in London in 1991, Acutis, who later lived in Milan, was known for his love of technology and video games. He earned the nickname "God's influencer" for creating websites that documented "miracles" to spread Catholic teaching before his untimely death from leukemia at age 15. His path to sainthood involved the attribution of two miracles, including a woman's breast cancer remission. The Vatican fast-tracked his canonization, aiming to inspire and energize faith among young people who can relate to his modern life.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, though she will remain global editorial director, raising questions about the magazine's future relevance in a rapidly changing media landscape. Wintour, known for her intuitive understanding of the zeitgeist and expanding cover subjects to include pop stars and politicians, transformed Vogue into a cultural arbiter during her nearly 40-year tenure. Her successor, Chloe Malle, plans to shift towards less frequent, theme-based issues to make print editions collectible. Critics debate Vogue's current influence against the backdrop of digital platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and Wintour's own controversies, including accusations of selling out and slow progress on diversity.</p>

This system will replace manual passport stamping, requiring travelers to register biometric information, including fingerprints and photos, at kiosks or with border officers. While intended to make travel smoother, concerns persist about potential long queues, especially at busy hubs like Dover and Eurostar terminals, during the initial registration phase. The EES registration will be valid for three years, with details verified on subsequent trips.</p>

San Diego is the prime suspect for a series of bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, linked to animal rights extremist groups. Former FBI agents recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him, including a high-speed chase and the discovery of a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car.

Australia, ranked seventh, unsettled England with their intensity and strategic kicks, even leading early in the game. However, England's defense proved outstanding, keeping Australia scoreless in the second half.
