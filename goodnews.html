          <h2>CyberArk Stock Surges on Reports of Acquisition Talks with Palo Alto Networks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 14:11:11 EDT</div>

          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk soared after a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks for a deal valued at over $20 billion. This potential acquisition highlights the growing importance of cloud security, especially with the rise of AI-related threats and ransomware attacks. If completed, it would be by far the largest acquisition for Palo Alto Networks, which has been actively consolidating the cybersecurity industry under CEO Nikesh Arora. The news caused CyberArk's stock to hit a record high, while Palo Alto's shares saw a slight decline.</p>

          <p>Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are reissuing 'Buckingham Nicks,' their sole studio album as a duo, originally released in 1973. The album, which was a commercial failure at the time, has become a sought-after collector's item and is credited with leading to their invitation to join Fleetwood Mac. Despite its initial lukewarm reception, the record is considered a crucial piece of evidence of their early folk-rock sound and musical partnership. The remastered version will be released on multiple formats, making it widely available to fans for the first time in half a century.</p>

          <p>A CNBC Fed Survey indicates a tight three-way race to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as the leading candidates. The survey of economists and fund managers also reveals that while most do not expect President Trump to fire Powell before his term ends, they believe the political pressure is compromising the Fed's independence. Despite this, 65% of respondents anticipate a rate cut in September, with further cuts expected by year-end and into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Value of a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit Account in August</h2>

          <p>This article explores the viability of opening a high-value Certificate of Deposit (CD) account in the current economic climate. While interest rates are not at their recent peaks, they remain relatively high, offering consistent returns in the 4% to 4.5% range. The absence of a Federal Reserve meeting in August provides a stable period for savers to lock in these rates. However, with potential rate cuts anticipated in September, the article suggests that now may be the last opportunity to secure a high-yield CD before rates potentially decline further.

          <p>Manchester City has re-signed goalkeeper James Trafford, a product of its own academy, from Burnley in a deal worth £27 million plus add-ons. The 22-year-old, who impressed during Burnley's promotion-winning season, returns to City on a five-year contract. The club exercised a buy-back clause to secure the player after Newcastle made a competing bid. Trafford's return adds significant competition for the number one spot, currently held by Ederson, and marks City's sixth signing of the current transfer window as they continue to strengthen their squad.</p>

          <p>The recently signed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' (OBBBA) is set to deliver a significant financial windfall to Big Tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The law restores key tax provisions, including immediate expensing for R&D and 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures, which had been phased out. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate this could unlock billions in free cash flow for these companies, which are heavily investing in AI data centers and infrastructure. This extra liquidity will provide greater flexibility for reinvestment, deepening their competitive advantages in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI has introduced 'study mode,' a new feature within ChatGPT designed to help students learn by guiding them through problems rather than providing direct answers. The tool aims to address educators' concerns about AI being used for cheating by instead promoting critical thinking and step-by-step problem-solving. Developed in collaboration with teachers and students, study mode will prompt users with guiding questions when they seek help with homework or test preparation. The feature is being rolled out to all ChatGPT users and will be available in the university-focused ChatGPT Edu version soon.</p>

          <p>Actor Paul Wesley, who portrays a younger James T. Kirk in 'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,' revealed he made a conscious choice not to imitate William Shatner's iconic performance. Wesley explained that he rewatched the original series but decided to develop his own interpretation, reasoning that his character is a pre-captain version of Kirk who is still developing. He noted that he received Shatner's blessing for the role, who told him to 'take care of my crew and my ship.' Wesley praised the show's optimism and inclusivity, calling it an 'escapist playground.'</p>

          <p>During his four-day visit to Scotland, President Donald Trump met with First Minister John Swinney, discussing the potential exemption of Scotch whisky from U.S. tariffs and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Swinney urged Trump to use his influence to secure a ceasefire, while also appealing for relief from the 10% tariff on Scotch, which is costing the industry millions weekly. The meeting occurred as Trump opened a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort. A Scottish government source described a 'window of opportunity' to make progress on the tariff issue before Trump's next UK visit.</p>
