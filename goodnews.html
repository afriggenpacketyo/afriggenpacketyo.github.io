          <h2>UK Government Pledges to Halve Sewage Discharges into Waterways by 2030</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:16:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's environment secretary has announced a "water revolution" plan to halve the number of sewage discharges into English and Welsh waterways by 2030. Citing the water sector as "broken" and its regulator, Ofwat, as "failing," the government aims to implement tougher measures, including potential prison sentences for non-compliant water company executives. This new target addresses widespread public outrage over river and coastal pollution, though critics note the pledge is political and not legally binding. The plan also includes a UK-wide ban on wet wipes containing plastic.</p>

          <p>China and Vietnam are scheduled to hold their first joint army training exercise this month in China's Guangxi region, which shares a border with Vietnam. The Chinese defence ministry stated the drill's theme is "joint border patrol training" and aims to deepen practical cooperation between the two militaries. This move comes as the two nations mark their 75th year of diplomatic relations and follows a visit by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who encouraged cooperation to counter "unilateral bullying." The closer military ties reflect strengthening economic relations, with China being Vietnam's largest trading partner.</p>

          <h2>Bear That Fatally Attacked Jogger in Italy is Relocated to German Sanctuary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:01:00 EDT</div>

          <p>A brown bear known as JJ4, which killed a 26-year-old jogger in Italy last year, has been moved to a wildlife sanctuary in Germany's Black Forest. The relocation follows a protracted legal battle where animal rights groups successfully protested an initial order to euthanize the bear. The incident had sparked a significant debate in Italy over human-wildlife conflict as the region's bear population has grown. The bear, which arrived safely, will now live in a specially constructed, secure enclosure at the German park, where her mother has resided since 2010.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Find in China Suggests Some Pterosaurs May Have Been Herbivores</h2>

          <p>A rare pterosaur fossil discovered in northeastern China is challenging long-held beliefs about the diet of these ancient flying reptiles. The fossil of a Sinopterus atavismus, a type of pterodactyloid, contained the first-ever evidence of stomach contents for its kind. Researchers found phytoliths, microscopic mineral deposits from plants, and small quartz crystals, which were likely ingested as gastroliths to help grind tough plant matter. This discovery, published in Science Bulletin, provides the first direct confirmation of herbivory in this group of pterosaurs, shedding new light on the diverse ecosystems of the dinosaur era.</p>

          <h2>An Opinion on the Pressures of Summer Parenting and the Flawed "Wild Summer" Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the modern pressures of parenting during the summer, contrasting the author's choice for an unscheduled summer with the necessity for other working parents to use expensive, logistically complex camps. The author argues that recent media trends romanticizing unstructured "'90s summers" often ignore the financial realities and immense mental load placed on parents, particularly mothers. The piece suggests that the debate over summer activities is a symptom of a larger societal failure to support families with affordable childcare and flexible work structures. The desire for a "wild summer" is less about child development and more about parents' desperate need for a reprieve.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have captured the first direct evidence of rocky planet formation around a very young, sun-like star named HOPS-315. Located 1,370 light-years away, the infant star is only 100,000 to 200,000 years old. Researchers detected silicate minerals and silicon monoxide gas condensing in the star's surrounding disk, the fundamental building blocks of planets like Earth. This groundbreaking observation provides an unprecedented glimpse into the dawn of our own solar system and suggests that the initial steps of planet formation may be a common process.</p>

          <p>South Africa is making a concerted effort to increase its exports to China to counter a growing trade deficit and mitigate the impact of a potential 30% US tariff hike. A high-level delegation visited Beijing to promote investment and diversify South Africa's export portfolio from raw commodities to higher-value goods like pharmaceuticals and green energy tech. The nation's trade deficit with China reached $9.71 billion in 2023, and officials are seeking to address market access barriers. While China presents a crucial alternative market, analysts caution that it is not a simple replacement for the US. (not investment advice)</p>
