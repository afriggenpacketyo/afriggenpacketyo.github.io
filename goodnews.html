          <h2>Justin Bieber's Surprise Album 'Swag' Delivers a Raw and Authentic R&B Sound</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 16:33:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise 21-track album titled "Swag," which critics are describing as a raw, improvisatory, and authentic return to his R&B roots. The album follows a tumultuous period for the artist, including health issues, a split with his longtime manager, and the birth of his first child. The music features murky, cooled-out grooves and includes demo-like tracks, reflecting a less polished and more personal creative process. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album embraces an idiosyncratic vibe that aligns with modern pop trends, showcasing a more instinctual and vulnerable side of Bieber's artistry and personal life.</p>

          <p>The latest "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, has launched with an impressive $122 million in ticket sales across the U.S. and Canada, marking a significant success for DC Studios and Warner Bros. This opening represents a crucial new beginning for the DC cinematic universe, which has recently seen a string of underperforming films. The debut is the third-largest of 2025 and the first DC title to exceed the $100 million opening weekend mark since "Wonder Woman" in 2017. While the domestic performance was strong, international box office sales were more modest, totaling $95 million across 78 markets.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are championing a bipartisan sanctions bill designed to give President Trump a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation, which has 85 cosponsors, would allow the president to impose tariffs up to 500% on countries that support Russia's war effort, such as China, India, and Brazil. This push comes as Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and considers sending more defensive weapons to Ukraine. The senators, who recently met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, believe this strong, unified pressure is essential to force Putin to the negotiating table and end the war.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been lovingly transformed into a unique public art gallery by its owner, Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt undertook an eight-year renovation to create the Cookie Factory gallery, which opened to the public free of charge in May. The mission behind the privately funded space is to provide a place for community connection and healing through art, a cause deeply personal to Precourt. The inaugural exhibition features nature-inspired works by artist Sam Falls, with plans to rotate to new artists and continue serving as a gift to the city.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is emphasizing that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is urging for a significant, bipartisan investment in the country's forecasting infrastructure. She plans to recommend upgrades to Doppler radar, ocean buoys, and data analytics capabilities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Cantwell argues that such investments are crucial for providing more advanced warnings for floods, tornadoes, and fires, ultimately saving lives and preventing future tragedies on the scale of what occurred in Kerr County.</p>
