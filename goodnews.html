          <p>In a recent interview, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan emphasized the Trump administration's support for developing the state's natural resources, contrasting it with what he described as restrictive policies under the Biden administration. He highlighted the strategic importance of the Alaska LNG Project for both the local economy and U.S. allies in Asia, noting significant progress has been made. Sullivan also addressed national security, discussing the military buildup in the Arctic to counter Russian and Chinese activities and the state's central role in the nation's missile defense system, known as the Golden Dome initiative. The senator defended provisions beneficial to Alaska in recent legislation as necessary to address the state's unique challenges.</p>

The presence of these leaders aims to prevent a repeat of a previous tense encounter between Trump and Zelenskyy and to counter concerns that Ukraine might be pressured into an unfavorable deal following Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the nature of peace, contrasting the world's conditional tranquility with the steady peace offered by faith in God. The author recounts an experience during a flight cancellation at a chaotic airport, where the calmest individual was an infant being held by its mother. This scene is used as a metaphor for the security and comfort that belief can provide amid life's turmoil, suggesting that one can have the peace of Jesus just as the baby had the peace of its mother. The piece encourages readers to exchange anxiety for a deeper, more resilient sense of calm rooted in divine presence.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after a brief but disruptive strike by over 10,000 flight attendants was halted by the Canadian government. Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu intervened less than 12 hours after the strike began, ordering the union and the airline into binding arbitration to resolve their contract dispute, citing the need to protect the economy and supply chains. The union, which is seeking higher wages and pay for on-the-ground work, accused the government of violating workers' rights. The airline has warned that while flights will resume, it may take up to 10 days to fully stabilize its schedule.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a unique £3 million party and event space after a challenging five-year renovation. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned, off-grid property in 2017 and undertook the massive project of making it habitable, which included installing basic utilities like water and electricity for the first time in years. Originally built in the 1850s to defend against French naval attacks, the historic fort now features 40 beds and its own nightclub. The renovation highlights the potential for preserving historic buildings while adapting them for modern use.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key part of her mental and emotional recovery from a torn ACL that sidelined her for 13 months. The practice, suggested by a teammate, helped her maintain a positive outlook and visualize her goals, such as returning to the court and competing at a high level. Brink focused on manifesting a "wonderful life" beyond just basketball, including her relationships and personal well-being. This mental rehearsal is credited by both Brink and the team's psychotherapist as crucial for managing the anxiety of a long rehabilitation and enabling her strong return to the WNBA.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man, Ryan Wardwell, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. Wardwell was rappelling down a series of falls known as the Seven Teacups when the river's strong hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into the cavern. After an extensive search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries in what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the total cost of attending some U.S. colleges approaches $100,000 per year, this article highlights nine institutions that offer a completely tuition-free education to all admitted students. These schools, which include Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have rigorous academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for free tuition, students at non-military schools often participate in mandatory work programs, while service academy graduates must commit to several years of active duty. These colleges provide a distinct alternative for students seeking higher education without incurring substantial debt.</p>

          <p>A program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas has enabled a small group of elderly parents to obtain temporary visas to visit their undocumented children in the United States, facilitating emotional reunions after decades apart. The article follows José Antonio Rodríguez, who had not seen his parents in 24 years since he left home to find work in California. The reunion, hosted in East Los Angeles, highlights the profound personal cost of immigration policies that separate families for generations. While a joyous moment for the few whose visas were approved, it also underscores the heartbreak for many others who remain separated.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to discover that his trail camera had captured footage of a brown bear, a species once considered extinct in the country. The sighting in the Šalčininkai district is one of several recent appearances that suggest the large predators are returning to the region's ecosystem. Brown bears play a vital ecological role, and their reappearance is seen by conservationists as a positive sign of a healthy environment. This event, occurring shortly after a bear cub was spotted elsewhere in the country, has prompted calls for the species to be added to Lithuania's official list of protected animals.</p>

          <p>This article profiles the "NoMa" (North of Massachusetts Avenue) neighborhood in Washington, D.C., as a prime example of the "Yes In My Back Yard" (YIMBY) urban development philosophy. Formerly an industrial area known as "Swampoodle," the district has undergone significant redevelopment since the 1990s, transforming into a dense, transit-oriented hub of residential and commercial buildings. The success of NoMa in adding substantial new housing and amenities near the city's main train station showcases the potential of pro-growth policies to revitalize urban areas. It stands in contrast to the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) sentiment that often stalls development in other cities.</p>

          <p>Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong, has been granted asylum in Australia. Hui fled Hong Kong in 2020 after being charged with criminal offenses related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was one of several activists targeted with a police bounty in 2023. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for its protection but also conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return home. He urged Australia to do more to help other activists who remain imprisoned in Hong Kong for their political beliefs.</p>
