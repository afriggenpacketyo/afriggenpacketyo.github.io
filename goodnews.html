          <p>The U.S. Air Force has commenced ground tests of its new AI-driven combat drones, marking an intensification of its technological competition with China in the development of unmanned weapons systems. The YFQ-42A and YFQ-44A drones, created by General Atomics and Anduril, are the first unmanned aircraft to receive fighter designations in U.S. military history. This initiative reflects a strategic move towards autonomous aerial warfare, with these next-generation uncrewed aircraft designed to operate alongside crewed fighter jets.</p>
