          <p>A framework deal between the U.S. and China for TikTok's American operations is nearing finalization, with technology giant Oracle and private equity firm Silver Lake expected to be major investors. The precise structure, including ByteDance's continued involvement and control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm, remains under active negotiation. This agreement follows years of U.S. national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to user data and content manipulation, which led to a congressional bill requiring divestment or a ban. President Trump has delayed enforcement, but a new deadline looms, as he seeks to ensure a favorable deal for the popular platform, citing its importance to younger voters.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's Tmall merchants are strategically expanding into Southeast Asia through its subsidiary, Lazada, streamlining cross-border e-commerce for invited sellers. This innovative initiative eliminates the need for merchants to establish new stores, hire local teams, or manage logistics, as Lazada will handle everything from warehousing to localized customer service. Global brands like audio electronics firm Harman International and sports equipment company Spalding have already joined the invite-only program. This strategic move reflects Alibaba's commitment to diversifying product offerings in Southeast Asia's rapidly growing internet economy, which is projected to exceed $330 billion this year, aiming to capture a larger market share.</p>

          <p>King Charles and other senior royals attended the funeral of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, at Westminster Cathedral. However, Queen Camilla was notably absent from the historic service, sending her 'deep regrets' as she recovers from acute sinusitis, though she plans to participate in President Trump's state visit. The funeral marked the first Catholic service for a member of the Royal Family in modern times, with a message from Pope Leo read during the Requiem Mass. The Duchess, who passed away at 92, was fondly remembered for her kindness, dedication to charities, and deep love of music, having volunteered at a homeless charity and taught music.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has appointed Mike Liberatore, formerly the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its new business finance officer, tasked with overseeing significant infrastructure spending. Liberatore's move further intensifies the escalating rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were once co-founders of OpenAI before a public falling out. This hiring follows Musk's lawsuit against Altman and OpenAI for alleged breach of contract, and OpenAI's recent valuation at $500 billion, with a substantial $300 billion deal with Oracle for compute commitments. Liberatore's departure from xAI, after just three months, was part of a series of high-profile exits from Musk's AI startup.</p>

          <p>Despite 62% of U.S. adults aspiring to be their own boss, many are held back by financial concerns, fear of failure, and a perceived lack of business knowledge. Experts advise against waiting for 'perfect' savings, suggesting a 2-6 month expense safety net and testing business ideas as side hustles. For minimizing startup costs, service-based businesses are recommended for their lower overhead and ability to capitalize on existing skills. To address knowledge gaps, entrepreneurs should clarify their offer, build customer rapport, and actively seek mentors. Overcoming fear of failure requires resilience and proactive engagement, as preparation and networking are crucial for long-term success.</p>

          <p>Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek has conducted internal evaluations concerning the 'frontier risks' of its AI models, according to a source familiar with the matter. Frontier risks refer to potential significant threats to public safety and social stability posed by advanced AI systems. This development aligns with Beijing's broader push to raise awareness and promote safety within China's burgeoning AI industry. Unlike many U.S. AI firms such as Anthropic and OpenAI, which regularly publish the findings of their frontier risk evaluations, Chinese companies have not typically publicized such details, keeping DeepSeek's specific results and involved models undisclosed for now.</p>

While an industry-wide oversupply of flights forced many airlines to cut fares and scale back growth plans, United is notably outpacing rivals with a projected 5.7% domestic U.S. capacity increase in 2025. Kirby believes this strategic approach demonstrates resilience during economic downturns and positions United for significant upside when the economy ultimately recovers, emphasizing the airline's brand loyalty in a market often treating air travel as a commodity.</p>

          <p>Europe's gas reserves are currently at 80%, providing a solid buffer for the upcoming winter, largely due to diversified supplies from Norway, the U.S., and Qatar, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. While global supply is up and demand weaker, the bloc's energy stability is threatened by U.S. President Trump's pressure on Brussels to impose tariffs on Russian energy buyers like China and India. Trump's administration is considering imposing 100% tariffs, with 50% already applied to India. The expiration of the Ukraine-Russia gas transit deal had limited market impact due to prior diversification. The EU aims for complete Russian gas independence by 2027, but Trump's actions add significant geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

This market reaction indicates investor response to economic data suggesting robust consumer activity, which could influence future monetary policy decisions. Dow futures saw a slight dip, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures edged up, reflecting a mixed but generally positive market sentiment.

This ancient practice, believed to have been common among hunter-gatherer communities, allowed for sustained physical and spiritual connections with ancestors, bridging time and memory.
