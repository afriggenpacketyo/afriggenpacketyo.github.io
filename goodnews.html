          <h2>China's Panda Diplomacy Faces Uncertainty as Japan Nears Zero Panda Status</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan approaches its first giant panda-free period in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. relations strained, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize ties with Tokyo. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship and brought economic benefits to Japan as tourist attractions. Experts speculate that China will likely loan new pandas to Japan, possibly during a high-level visit, especially after agreeing to resume importing Japanese marine products. However, historical and territorial disputes, along with political factors like the pro-Taiwan mayor of Shirahama, could complicate matters.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Identifies Phrases That Hinder Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five phrases that parents should avoid using to encourage children to listen. These phrases, such as "Because I said so" and "Stop crying, you're fine," often trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, hindering communication. Instead, Raouda suggests alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, such as "I know you don't like this decision, I'll explain, and then we're moving forward." By shifting to language that fosters respect and emotional safety, parents can create conditions where cooperation feels natural.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro injections, a weight loss medication, will now be available at GP surgeries in England for individuals meeting strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to ensure that the jabs reach those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources. The first group of patients eligible for Mounjaro includes those with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and four out of five specific health conditions. Patients will also receive wrap-around care, including support with exercise and healthy eating, although some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria against booking appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This transformation was driven by government subsidies, long-term planning, and a focus on dominating future technologies. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EV production. The country now has the world's largest public charging network and dominates critical supply chains in battery production. This has resulted in a thriving EV start-up sector and fierce competition, making EVs more affordable for the mass market.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a clinic offering ketamine as a treatment for severe depression, providing an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that offers ketamine-assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a recreational drug, is being explored for its potential to treat depression, with some patients reporting positive experiences. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is set to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, which will include updated information on ketamine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Florida Republican congresswoman, Kat Cammack, attributes the reluctance of hospital staff to administer the necessary medication for her ectopic pregnancy to fearmongering by pro-abortion groups. Cammack, who opposes abortion, experienced delays in receiving treatment due to concerns about violating Florida‚Äôs six-week abortion ban, despite the procedure being exempt from the law. She believes that messaging from pro-abortion groups has created a climate of fear among medical staff, while abortion rights activists argue that the restrictive law itself caused the problem. Cammack hopes that sharing her experience will help bridge the political divide on healthcare access for women.</p>
