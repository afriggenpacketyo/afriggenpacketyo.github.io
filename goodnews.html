          <p>Seventeen family members of Sinaloa Cartel leaders, including the ex-wife of El Chapo, have reportedly crossed into the United States, suggesting a potential deal with the Trump administration. Mexico's security secretary confirmed the reports, indicating that the family members of Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez, one of El Chapo‚Äôs sons, surrendered to American authorities as part of a negotiation or plea bargain. Ovidio Guzm√°n L√≥pez plans to plead guilty to federal drug charges, making him the first of El Chapo‚Äôs sons to acknowledge guilt in a U.S. federal courthouse, potentially implicating others in the organization. The U.S. Department of Justice has also announced new charges against men accused of being Sinaloa Cartel leaders, the first since President Trump designated it a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Apple will pay $95 million to settle allegations that its voice assistant, Siri, eavesdropped on users' private conversations and shared them with third-party businesses. The lawsuit claimed that Siri-enabled devices, including iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple TVs, unintentionally recorded confidential communications, leading to targeted advertising. Consumers who owned these devices between September 2014 and December 2024 and experienced unintended Siri activations during private conversations are eligible to file a claim. Eligible users can file claims for up to five devices, with a maximum payout of $100, with payments expected to be distributed later this year pending final approval.</p>

          <p>A new Republican tax bill proposes raising the child tax credit to $2,500 per child but could exclude an estimated 17 million children whose parents do not earn enough to qualify. The bill also requires a US citizen child‚Äôs parent or guardian to possess a social security number, making undocumented immigrants and other immigrants who lack work authorization ineligible to claim the credit on behalf of their children. Critics argue that the bill penalizes children who are United States citizens, while Republicans defend the measure as fiscally responsible, though it contradicts pronatalist goals.</p>

Mahmood warned that despite promised new prisons, it would not be possible to "build our way out of this crisis," but the changes will not apply to those who commit a serious further offense or are deemed to pose a high risk.</p>

The sanctions had effectively cut Syria out of the international banking system and isolated it from the global economy. Trump also met with Syria‚Äôs president, Ahmed al-Shara, a former rebel leader who spearheaded the campaign that toppled Bashar al-Assad, marking the first time in 25 years the leaders of the two countries had met.
