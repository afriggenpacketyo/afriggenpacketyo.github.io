          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement, with both countries aiming to strike a deal by mid-June despite persistent disagreements. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's chief tariff negotiator, noted that progress has been made after talks with U.S. officials, but significant hurdles remain. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which currently amount to a 24 percent duty on Japanese goods. Japan has presented a comprehensive package of proposals, including cooperation in supply chains, shipbuilding, and increased imports of U.S. farm products, to address U.S. concerns about non-tariff barriers. No decision has been made on whether there will be another round of tariff talks next week or beyond. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former Arkansas police chief who escaped from prison while serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, has been recaptured after nearly two weeks on the run. Hardin was found approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit, where he escaped by impersonating a corrections officer. Law enforcement officials, including a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit, located Hardin near Moccasin Creek, and he was taken into custody. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders expressed gratitude for the collaborative effort of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies in bringing the search to a peaceful conclusion. The FBI and U.S. Marshals had offered a combined $25,000 reward for information leading to his capture.</p>

          <p>Japanese securities firms are donating shareholder perks, such as food and beverages, to nonprofit organizations supporting children living in poverty. The Japan Securities Dealers Association initiated the program in 2020, facilitating around 2,300 donations by March of this year. Participating companies present a list of shareholder perks to registered organizations, who then request specific items for recipients. The program has resulted in donations of approximately 11 tons of rice and 8,600 liters of beverages, benefiting single-mother households and children's gatherings. The initiative reflects a commitment to addressing poverty amid rising inflation.</p>
