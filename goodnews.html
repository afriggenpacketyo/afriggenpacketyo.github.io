          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, to power his team to a formidable total of 587. Following this dominant batting display, India's bowlers quickly dismantled England's top order, leaving them struggling at 77-3 by the close of day two. The performance gives India total control of the match as they seek to level the series, presenting a significant challenge to England's renowned aggressive strategy under captain Ben Stokes.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for homeowners considering borrowing $150,000 against their home's equity. It breaks down the differences between a fixed-rate home equity loan and a variable-rate home equity line of credit (HELOC). While current average rates make their initial monthly payments nearly identical, the article stresses that a HELOC's cost can fluctuate with market conditions, making it potentially cheaper or more expensive over the loan's lifetime compared to the stability of a traditional home equity loan.

          <p>This article highlights five critical errors consumers make that can significantly increase the cost of their credit card debt, especially in a high-interest-rate environment. It warns against the pitfalls of making only minimum payments, which prolongs debt, and ignoring the expiration dates of 0% APR promotional offers.

          <p>A recent survey in Germany reveals strong public support for tightening regulations on underage drinking. Nearly two-thirds of Germans believe 14-year-olds should be barred from drinking alcohol, even with parental supervision, and over half support raising the legal purchase age for beer and wine from 16 to 18. These findings align with long-standing calls from German medical associations to implement stricter health policies to mitigate the risks associated with early alcohol consumption among young people.</p>

          <p>Budget airline Ryanair has announced it will increase its free personal cabin bag size allowance by 20 percent, to new dimensions of 40cm x 30cm x 20cm. The change aligns with a broader EU initiative to standardize minimum hand luggage sizes across airlines, aiming to reduce passenger confusion and unexpected fees at the gate. While Ryanair's new size is more generous than the new EU minimum, it still differs from the allowances of some of its low-cost competitors.</p>
