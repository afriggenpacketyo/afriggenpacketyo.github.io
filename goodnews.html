          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' predictions but decelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The data reflects underlying fragility, with key indicators like retail sales and fixed asset investment showing weakness, while industrial output proved stronger than expected. Despite resilient exports and government stimulus measures aimed at offsetting US trade tensions, economists remain cautious, pointing to insufficient domestic demand and calling for further fiscal support to ensure sustainable growth.

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries is set to be released, but an analysis highlights that many of its highest-paid personalities do not appear on the list. This is because stars employed by independent production companies or the BBC's commercial arm, BBC Studios, are not included, creating an incomplete picture of talent earnings. High-profile figures like Claudia Winkleman, Graham Norton, and the stars of shows like "The Apprentice" are among those whose significant earnings are not publicly disclosed.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the United States. The block comes in response to an emergency motion filed by an immigration advocacy group challenging the administration's decision to end the protections. The Department of Homeland Security had argued that conditions in Afghanistan no longer warranted the special status, which was granted to many following the Taliban's takeover in 2021.</p>
