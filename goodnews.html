          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the New York Stock Exchange. This move follows the collapse of a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe due to regulatory hurdles, which resulted in Figma receiving a $1 billion termination fee. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and rising profits. In a letter to investors, CEO Dylan Field stated it was time for the company to go public to allow the community to share in its ownership and to enable "big swings," including future acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's new four-year, $285-million contract extension with the Oklahoma City Thunder gives him the richest annual salary in NBA history at $71.25 million. This article places his deal in the context of other major sports, noting that while MLB contracts like Shohei Ohtani's and Juan Soto's have higher total values, top NBA players earn more per year due to smaller roster sizes. The analysis contrasts these with the NFL, where the highest-paid players are exclusively quarterbacks, and highlights the risks of long-term, high-value contracts, citing both successful and disappointing examples across different leagues.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks, including NextEra Energy and AES, experienced a significant jump after a punitive tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." The proposed tax, which would have targeted projects using components from China, could have cost the industry up to $7 billion. While its removal provided relief, industry associations caution that the overall legislation remains detrimental to renewable energy, as it still phases out crucial investment and production tax credits. The bill now moves to the House for further consideration of the Senate's amendments. (not investment advice)</p>

FBI Director Kash Patel stated the move is a cost-effective solution that provides a safer workplace for agents and keeps the headquarters near the Department of Justice.

          <p>The biotech company ZymoChem is tackling the environmental impact of disposable diapers by creating a biodegradable super absorbent polymer (SAP). Using a fermentation process similar to brewing beer, the company converts corn sugar into a bio-based material that can replace the fossil-fuel-based plastics making up a large portion of typical diapers. This innovative drop-in solution is nearing cost parity with its petroleum-based counterparts. With investors like Toyota Ventures and Lululemon, ZymoChem's technology is also being applied to other products, including bio-based nylon for athletic apparel, signaling a broader shift toward a circular, non-petroleum-derived supply chain.</p>

          <p>A bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of genetic testing company 23andMe's assets to a nonprofit led by its co-founder, Anne Wojcicki, for $305 million. The decision comes after the company's financial collapse raised significant privacy concerns over the fate of its 13 million customers' genetic data, prompting several states to sue to block any sale without user consent. The judge ruled that the sale to Wojcicki's nonprofit was the best path forward, as it would honor customers' rights and improve privacy practices. 23andMe, once valued at $6 billion, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March amid struggles with revenue and a major data breach.</p>

The ship's crew broadcast a "man overboard" alert, stopped the vessel, and deployed a rescue boat to retrieve them, earning praise for their swift and effective actions.

While the script can be heavy-handed and its historical allusions confusing, the film succeeds as a tense portrait of a family's struggle.

Cloudflare argues that AI crawlers have been taking content without limit, depriving creators of traffic and revenue.

The push has included a major investment in Scale AI and hiring its CEO, along with poaching top researchers from competitors.
