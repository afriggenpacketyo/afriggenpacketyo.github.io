          <p>This article argues in favor of a proposed $20 billion U.S. loan to support Argentina's currency and President Javier Milei's free-market reforms. Despite contradicting the "America First" rhetoric and facing political opposition, the author contends the bailout is a wise strategic investment in regional democracy and economic stability. The piece highlights Milei's significant achievements in reducing inflation and deregulating the economy but notes a misstep in managing the peso's devaluation created the current currency crisis. The author concludes that supporting Milei's agenda is crucial to demonstrating the success of market-oriented policies in a hemisphere where authoritarianism is gaining ground.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock value increased by 7% following reports that the company is in preliminary discussions to manufacture chips for its primary competitor, AMD. Securing AMD as a client would represent a major victory for Intel's burgeoning foundry business, which aims to produce chips for other companies. Such a partnership would not only provide a significant revenue stream but also signal to the market that Intel's manufacturing capabilities are trusted even by its biggest rival. AMD, which currently relies on manufacturer TSMC, has not confirmed the talks, and Intel has declined to comment on the speculation.</p>

          <p>A new bilingual special series from NPR, titled "Cumbia Across Latin America," embarks on a visual exploration of the cumbia music genre. Once the sound of the working class, cumbia originated on the Colombian coast from a blend of African, Indigenous, and European influences. The series documents how its infectious rhythm has evolved and spread across the continent, from rural villages to major cities like Los Angeles, becoming a symbol of Latin American identity. Supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, photographers spent years documenting the people and cultures that have kept the genre vibrant across six different countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the origins of cumbia music in Colombia, tracing its birth to the cultural fusion of enslaved Africans, Indigenous peoples, and European colonizers along the Caribbean coast. The music's percussive heart comes from African drums, while its melodic elements are derived from Indigenous flutes, known as gaitas, which became symbols of peace during the country's long civil war. The feature highlights the crucial role of Afro-descendant women in preserving and transmitting these musical traditions through generations. It also explores how the genre, initially dismissed by the upper classes, was eventually embraced and popularized by iconic musicians like Jose Benito Barros.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a temporary ruling allowing Lisa Cook to continue serving as a Federal Reserve governor, denying President Trump's request for her immediate removal. The president had moved to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Cook sued to block the firing, arguing it was an illegal attempt at political interference with the independent central bank. The court's decision puts a hold on her removal and sets the case for arguments in January, allowing her to participate in at least two more interest rate decisions.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has confirmed that all benefit payments, including retirement, disability, and SSI, will continue to be issued on schedule during the federal government shutdown. While local offices will remain open, they will operate with reduced services, as about 6,000 of the agency's employees will be furloughed. Core functions like applying for benefits and filing appeals will continue, but services such as obtaining proof of income letters, correcting earnings records, and replacing Medicare cards will be suspended. The shutdown could, however, delay the October release of inflation data needed to calculate the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment.</p>

          <p>A popular tech YouTuber from the channel Phone Repair Guru purchased two refurbished iPhone 14 Pros from the e-commerce platform Temu to assess their quality. Despite Temu's reputation for scams, a detailed teardown revealed both phones were in excellent condition with original, untampered internal components and minimal cosmetic wear. The batteries were still within Apple's normal health range, and all functions worked correctly. However, the YouTuber still cautioned against buying phones from the platform, noting that the price he paid was significantly higher than the used market rate and that the site is rife with listings for fake iPhones.</p>

          <p>Following the news of her death, this article republishes a 2019 interview with Jane Goodall where she discussed her philosophy on conservation and hope. She identified greed as the biggest problem facing the planet, driving a wedge between the "haves and the have-nots" and fueling environmental destruction. Goodall explained that her conservation work evolved to include lifting people out of poverty, realizing that communities would not protect wildlife if their own survival was at stake. She emphasized that individuals can create change through small, ethical daily choices, and found hope in youth activism and the resilience of nature.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly payment on a $70,000 home equity loan is now slightly lower, ranging from approximately $677 to $862 depending on the loan term. The article compares current costs to those from earlier in the year and last fall, noting that while rates are more favorable now, the differences are marginal. With cumulative home equity levels at a new national record, homeowners have significant borrowing power.

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an 8% increase in third-quarter U.S. vehicle sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. Consumers rushed to purchase EVs before a $7,500 federal tax incentive expired at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's increased by 30%. Industry analysts expect a record for quarterly EV sales, capturing an estimated 10% market share, but anticipate a drop in the coming months now that the incentive program has ended. In response, some automakers are introducing new pricing and cash incentives to maintain sales momentum.</p>
