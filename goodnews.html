          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei's party experienced a significant setback in Buenos Aires provincial elections, losing to the opposition Peronist party. The Peronist candidate, Axel Kicillof, secured 46.8% of the vote, while Milei's La Libertad Avanza party garnered 33.8%. Milei acknowledged the defeat and pledged to accelerate his libertarian reforms, focusing on fiscal balance, economic openness, and inflation control. The election results are a wake-up call for Milei, who faces criticism over a bribery scandal and concerns about public spending cuts, as Buenos Aires contributes significantly to Argentina's GDP. The article highlights the potential shift in Argentina's political landscape. </p>

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is scheduled to meet with her counterparts from the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand in London to discuss strategies for combating people-smuggling. This marks Mahmood's first major engagement as home secretary, following a recent cabinet reshuffle. The talks occur amidst a surge in small boat arrivals to the UK, with over 30,000 people arriving this year alone. The government is exploring the expansion of military sites to house asylum seekers, a plan that has drawn criticism from refugee advocacy groups. The meeting will also address tackling child sexual abuse online and the spread of synthetic opioids. </p>
