          <p>During his visit to Scotland, Donald Trump held a meeting with First Minister John Swinney at his Balmedie Estate to discuss several key issues. The conversation covered the impact of U.S. tariffs on Scotch whisky, with Swinney advocating for an exemption for the crucial Scottish export. They also touched upon the taxation of North Sea oil and gas and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Swinney urging Trump to use his influence to push for a ceasefire. The meeting was part of a broader trip that combined business promotions with political discussions.</p>

          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk jumped as much as 18% following a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks. The potential deal is valued at over $20 billion, which would be Palo Alto Networks' largest acquisition to date. This move highlights the growing importance of cloud security, especially with the rise of AI-related threats, and signals further consolidation within the cybersecurity industry. The potential acquisition caused Palo Alto Networks' shares to slide slightly on the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, a move that would solidify its position as the largest U.S. credit card issuer. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the business marks a strategic retreat from its consumer banking ambitions, which faced challenges with rising loan loss provisions. The deal would provide Apple with a stable, experienced partner in JPMorgan, which is expected to bring a more disciplined approach to managing the high-growth credit card program after Goldman's tenure was marked by regulatory scrutiny.

          <p>A wildlife park in Pembrokeshire, Wales, is celebrating the birth of four critically endangered Sumatran tiger cubs, the largest such litter ever born in the United Kingdom. The arrival of the cubs to their 11-year-old mother, Terima, is a significant event for the global breeding program aimed at preserving the species, of which fewer than 400 remain in the wild. Officials at Manor House Wildlife Park expressed their excitement, highlighting the rarity of a four-cub litter and the new hope it brings for the genetic diversity of Sumatran tigers.</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are finding that affordable housing projects could soon become more profitable, driven by new government incentives and strong investor demand. A recently passed bill expanded the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, a key tool for financing such developments, which is expected to help create over a million new affordable rental homes. Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, firms are successfully raising large impact funds dedicated to affordable housing. The sector's growth is seen as a key opportunity to address the nation's severe housing shortage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Royal Collection Trust has received an insurance payment of over £3 million following the theft of two royal artifacts from a Paris museum last year.

The trust's annual report, which revealed the payout amount, states the funds will be used for the enhancement of the collection. The report also highlighted record visitor numbers at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, contributing to a profitable year for the charity.</p>

          <p>A painting by Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, purchased for just £150 at a house clearance sale in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. The piece, titled 'Vecchio Sultano,' was authenticated after an art dealer discovered it had previously been attributed to Dalí at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s. The mixed-media work is part of a series illustrating 'The Arabian Nights' that Dalí was commissioned to create. This rediscovery is considered significant for Dalí scholars, as it likely comes from a batch of works that were thought to be lost.</p>

The merger aims to connect Union Pacific's extensive network in the West with Norfolk Southern's routes across the East, streamlining national deliveries. The proposal will face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators, who have set a high bar for railroad consolidation after past mergers led to significant service disruptions. If approved, the deal could trigger further consolidation among the remaining major North American railroads. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the organization warned that this boost from front-loading trade is temporary and that significant uncertainty remains.
