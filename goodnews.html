          <h2>Maine Lawmaker Laurel Libby Regains Speaking Rights After Trans Athlete Censure</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Maine Representative Laurel Libby had her speaking rights restored after being censured for identifying a trans athlete in a social media post. The resolution to restore her rights passed with bipartisan support, surprising Libby, who believes it was due to her lawsuit's momentum and growing opposition to trans athletes in girls' sports. Libby has been a vocal critic of policies enabling trans inclusion and has challenged the governor's refusal to comply with President Trump's executive order. The issue of trans athletes' participation in sports remains contentious, with surveys showing public support for restricting women's sports to biological women. The restoration of Libby's rights reflects a shift in the political landscape surrounding this issue. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to a new defense spending goal of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%. President Trump praised the agreement as a win for the U.S., emphasizing the need for allies to increase their defense spending. In 2024, member countries spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with Poland, Estonia, and Latvia leading the way. The increased spending reflects growing concerns over global security and the need for a stronger collective defense. The agreement underscores the alliance's commitment to maintaining stability and deterring aggression. (not investment advice) Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Executives at the World Economic Forum in Tianjin urged Chinese companies to relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems overseas to strengthen their global expansions. With rising global trade uncertainty, particularly in the event of a second Trump term, Chinese companies are looking to build factories in new markets for both export and local sales. This strategy aims to enhance supply chain resilience and avoid tariffs. China's manufacturers began relocating supply chains during Trump's first term, expanding their presence in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and Morocco.

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states.
