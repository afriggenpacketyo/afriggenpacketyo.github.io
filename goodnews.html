          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and individuals aged 12-64 with health conditions increasing their risk from the virus, offering a lower dose alternative to their existing vaccine, Spikevax. This approval arrives with limitations, distinguishing it from Moderna's original vaccine, which is available for anyone six months and older. The decision follows a study involving 11,400 participants, demonstrating the new vaccine's safety and effectiveness comparable to its predecessor. This announcement coincides with the Trump administration's cancellation of Moderna's funding for a pandemic flu vaccine and changes in CDC recommendations for children's COVID-19 vaccinations, sparking controversy and debate among health officials. The new approval adds a new tool to help protect those at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match that was interrupted by fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium. Norrie, the former British number two, won 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-2, maintaining his focus despite the distractions. He described managing the fireworks as the toughest part of the match for both players, but ultimately used his experience to control the game. Fearnley acknowledged the noise was not ideal but not a reason for his loss, with Norrie now advancing to the last 16 of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, prompting authorities to close the area. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue efforts, aiming to save as many bees as possible, with hive boxes recovered and restored. Officials initially reported 250 million bees escaped, but corrected the number after consulting a beekeeper, emphasizing the importance of accurate information. The public was advised to avoid the area, particularly those allergic to bee stings, as authorities worked to manage the situation and ensure public safety. By morning, most bees had returned to their hives and the responsible parties took charge of their delivery.</p>

          <h2>Medicare Enrollment Delay: What to Consider</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life; however, individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan with 20 or more employees can typically delay enrollment without penalty. Delaying enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are disallowed upon Medicare enrollment. Medicare advises confirming appropriate coverage with the employer's benefits department before delaying application, to ensure you are appropriately covered and can delay your application. It is important to understand the rules and potential consequences of delaying Medicare enrollment to make informed decisions about healthcare coverage.</p>

          <p>The cost of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at El Vacilon Grocery in Brooklyn due to soaring egg prices. Owners Freddy and Yovanna Melo increased the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, to maintain a profit margin of 20 to 30 percent. The pandemic has elevated the costs of various items, and the couple relies on rent from apartments above the store to sustain their business. The sandwich remains a popular choice among neighborhood regulars, with the store preparing up to 60 before lunch on a busy day.</p>

However, experts say the increase in US autism rates is mostly explained by the expanding definitions of the condition, as well as more awareness and more screening for it. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes that are associated with autism, building a convincing case that genetics are the most important driver of autism‚Äôs development.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are widely disliked, often seen as dense and lacking genuine meaning, yet they persist in workplace communication. Studies suggest that using jargon can impede trust, with Gen Zers and lower-status employees being particularly susceptible to their use. Buzzwords are often employed to distract from the primary goal of making money, serving as metaphors rather than clear and direct language. The author advocates for speaking in real-human-people words, suggesting that individuals should focus on genuine communication rather than relying on overused corporate jargon.</p>
