          <p>Mexico has initiated a lawsuit against Google following the tech giant's decision to label the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America' on its maps platform after an executive order from the Trump administration. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit, highlighting Mexico's Foreign Relations Ministry's prior attempts to persuade Google against the name change. The dispute centers on the application of the 'Gulf of America' label, which Mexico argues should only apply to the portion over the U.S. continental shelf, while Google defends its policy of aligning with official local names, as the legislation now heads to the Senate. This article describes the events which led to the filing of the lawsuit.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is expected to introduce new immigration policies aimed at reducing the UK's net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The anticipated changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, potentially targeting the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions may be imposed on nationalities with higher rates of overstaying and asylum claims, while migrants may need to wait longer for permanent residency. Additionally, the white paper is expected to include tougher English language requirements for immigrants, and will highlight rules on the recruitment of international care workers.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recent UK-US trade deal as a 'platform for going further' in opening up trade opportunities between the two nations. The agreement has reduced or eliminated tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on certain UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions on the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) are ongoing, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the current deal. He also noted the positive reception from other ambassadors in Washington and highlighted the strong working relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump.</p>
