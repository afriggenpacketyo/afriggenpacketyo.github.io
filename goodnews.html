          <p>Joe McCallen, a 63-year-old from Tampa Bay, has driven 100,000 miles in three years for Google Street View, capturing panoramic images of Midwest and East Coast roads. This New York Times article details McCallen's experiences, from encountering moose to unexpected Northern Lights sightings. The initial Street View model in 2007 used socks to prevent condensation on cameras, but now planes, satellites, and user-submitted images contribute to the platform. Google is also working on AI to glean business information from Street View images, and McCallen plans to continue his work, embracing the flexibility and unique experiences it offers.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how U.S. inflation cooled slightly in April, but economists predict a surge in consumer prices due to President Trump's trade war. The Consumer Price Index rose 2.3 percent annually, the slowest pace since early 2021, but experts believe this is a temporary lull. Tariffs on imports are expected to drive prices up, although the full impact may take months to materialize as companies deplete existing inventories. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the situation to ensure long-term inflation expectations remain stable.</p>

          <p>This DW article explores how the Czech Republic's arms production is surging, potentially replacing the automotive industry as the country's main economic driver. While car manufacturing experienced a 7.1% decline in early 2025 due to decreased Western demand, the arms industry is thriving, with 90% of its output exported. The Ukraine war has fueled this growth, leading to increased production of ammunition, military vehicles, and other defense equipment. The arms industry is creating new jobs for automotive employees, with minimal retraining needed.</p>

          <p>This CBS News article reports that a tariff truce between the U.S. and China will provide some economic relief but prolongs uncertainty for businesses. Beginning May 14, the U.S. will lower its maximum tariff rate on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, and China will reduce its tariff on American goods to 10%. Experts warn that clinching a long-term trade deal will be challenging, and the reduced tariff rate could still lead to consumer price hikes. The truce is expected to improve consumer confidence and contain U.S. inflation, reducing the odds of a recession this year.</p>

However, the scale of the spending puts Germany on a potential collision course with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.
