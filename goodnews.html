        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to break the impasse in nuclear negotiations, Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments. The proposal, presented to U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, suggests Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with international oversight. This plan aims to offer a permanent solution, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and address concerns about Iran's nuclear program while allowing President Trump to claim a more substantial agreement. While the feasibility of such a venture remains uncertain given the strained relations between Iran and its regional rivals, it represents a potential path toward de-escalation and a diplomatic resolution.

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has reinstated Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, making them eligible for the Hall of Fame after their careers were marred by gambling scandals. The decision comes after Manfred changed the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, stating that bans would expire at death. Rose, who agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, died in September, while Jackson was banned for his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The earliest Rose or Jackson could be inducted into the Hall of Fame is 2028. Optimism score is 70.</p>
