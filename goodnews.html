          <p>The NHS is launching a national investigation into maternity care in England, prompted by a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. Health Secretary Wes Streeting apologized to families who suffered avoidable harm, emphasizing the need to ensure no parent or baby is ever let down again. The inquiry will urgently examine the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, including those in Leeds, Sussex, Gloucester, and Mid and South Essex. The investigation will consist of two parts: an urgent review of concerning units and a system-wide look at maternity and neonatal care to improve services across the NHS.</p>

          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, discovered a 1,000-year-old mummy of a child while installing pipes. The mummy, believed to be a boy between 10 and 15 years old, was found in a sitting position with arms and legs bent, wrapped in a shroud. The burial and associated objects are characteristic of the pre-Inca Chancay culture, which inhabited the Lima area between the 11th and 15th centuries. The discovery highlights the prevalence of archaeological sites in Lima, where utility companies are required to hire archaeologists during excavation work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A university teaching assistant grapples with the ethical implications of students using AI to complete assignments in humanities courses, questioning the enforcement of institutional rules that students don't take seriously. The real value of a humanities education lies in the formation of human persons, cultivating virtues like honesty and practical wisdom, rather than merely producing literary interpretations or cultural criticisms. Generative AI threatens to short-circuit this process by removing cognitive friction, which is essential for developing reasoning skills and making wise choices. Instead of strictly banning AI, the author suggests allowing students to use it but requiring them to reflect on how it changes their thinking and learning process.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that the vast majority of California voters support expanding access to translated ballots for people with limited English proficiency. The poll, conducted by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, found that about 70% of registered voters agree that eligible voters should receive ballots translated into their preferred language. The survey also indicated that most California voters favored a proposal that would allow all limited-English-speaking communities meeting a minimum threshold in a county to receive translated versions of voting materials. Providing translated ballots could increase voter turnout and make the voting process more accessible, said Rosalind Gold of the National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.</p>

          <p>Okinawa pledged to preserve and pass on the lessons of history at a ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki attended the ceremony, which comes amid rising global tensions and controversy over portrayals of civilian deaths at a local museum. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the reality of the battle and its lessons, while Ishiba pledged to reduce the burden of U.S. bases in Okinawa. The Battle of Okinawa claimed more than 200,000 military and civilian lives.</p>
