          <p>Families are campaigning for peas and lentils to be added to the UK's list of 14 legally required food allergens after children experienced life-threatening anaphylactic shock from unexpected pea protein in common foods like hot cross buns and ice cream. Parents express frustration over the increasing hidden presence of pea protein in products, making it a "game of roulette" for those with severe allergies. Experts support expanding the allergen list to include items like peas, pine nuts, and buckwheat, emphasizing the need for greater public awareness and more stringent labeling to ensure consumer safety and prevent serious health incidents.</p>

Melbourne, Australia, secured the second position, earning high marks for its diverse and inclusive atmosphere, along with a vibrant arts and culture scene, with 91% of Gen Z respondents praising its quality of life. New York City, the sole US representative at fourth place, was lauded for its walkability, extensive food scene, and rich cultural offerings, though its affordability remains a significant concern.

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system, celebrating its 10th anniversary, continues to be a popular avenue for public engagement, though its effectiveness in driving legislative change is debated. While historical petitions led to major civil rights advances, modern campaigns often include humorous or less serious topics alongside significant issues. Petitions gaining over 100,000 signatures can trigger parliamentary debates, offering a platform for backbenchers to pressure ministers. A notable success was Finn's Law, which granted police service animals greater legal protection after a petition garnered widespread support, demonstrating the system's potential for tangible impact despite its limitations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend sees individuals in their early 20s, like Sydney Brown, opting for "preventative botox" to pre-empt wrinkles, influenced by family and a desire for confidence. This practice, where small amounts of botulinum toxin are injected to relax muscles and reduce future static lines, is becoming increasingly popular among 18-34 year olds. However, medical experts like Nora Nugent caution against starting too young, arguing it's a waste of money with minimal immediate benefit and raising concerns about potential long-term muscle atrophy and the psychological pressure on young people. The article explores the debate between early intervention and the industry's ethical responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Patrick Cantlay delivered a stunning back-nine performance, including four birdies in his final five holes, to shoot a 64 and tie Tommy Fleetwood for the lead at the Tour Championship. Fleetwood, who had built momentum with four consecutive birdies, faced a setback with a double bogey but recovered with late birdies to finish with a 67. Both golfers are now 16 under par, setting up a thrilling final day at East Lake. Keegan Bradley also made a significant move with a 63, bolstering his case for a Ryder Cup captain's pick, as the tournament heads towards a dramatic conclusion.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Tamil Nadu, India, in collaboration with the UK's Face Lab, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from the ancient burial site of Kondagai. This groundbreaking work aims to understand the ancestry and migration routes of early inhabitants of the region, which is now a political flashpoint due to evidence of an independent urban civilization dating back to 580BC. The reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, highlighting the diverse origins of the subcontinent's population and challenging existing historical narratives.</p>

          <p>Bayern Munich's commanding 6-0 victory over RB Leipzig, featuring a Harry Kane hat-trick, underscored their continued dominance in the Bundesliga, raising concerns about the league's competitiveness. This consistent top-level success, with Bayern winning 13 of the last 14 titles, is seen as hindering the Bundesliga's global sporting and commercial appeal compared to leagues like the Premier League. In response, the DFL is implementing a new strategy, including granting live streaming rights to YouTube content creators for some matches, aiming to attract a younger, global audience and address the league's financial gap with other top European competitions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing significant reforms to sentencing rules, which would empower courts to impose new non-custodial penalties, including bans from pubs, concerts, and travel, or mandates for offenders to remain within specific geographical zones. These measures are designed to "toughen up community punishments" and reduce reoffending, aligning with recommendations to decrease prison overcrowding by utilizing fewer custodial sentences for less serious crimes. The planned legislation would allow such restrictions for any offense, with non-compliance resulting in further court action. This initiative represents a notable shift in the justice system's strategy towards community-based rehabilitation and deterrence.</p>
