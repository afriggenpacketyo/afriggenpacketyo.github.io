        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. The article details four key strategies: credit counseling for structured debt management, debt forgiveness for negotiating lower lump-sum settlements, and creditor hardship programs for temporary relief. For those with overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy offers legal protection and the potential to discharge or restructure what is owed, making them viable solutions for severe financial distress.

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," his first in four years, but it has been met with lukewarm reviews from music critics. While some reviews noted moments of brilliance and a nostalgic R&B sound, others described it as an "unfiltered cry for help" and artistically lethargic. The album features collaborations with several rappers and includes spoken-word tracks that address the media scrutiny of his personal life, contributing to a mixed and somewhat critical consensus on his comeback.</p>

          <p>Reform MP Rupert Lowe has been cleared by Parliament's standards commissioner following an investigation into a complaint about his failure to register donations in a timely manner. The complaint related to a crowdfunder for his independent "Rape Gang Inquiry." Lowe provided evidence that the 28-day window for registering the funds had not expired, leading the commissioner to conclude that no rules were breached. Lowe described the complaint as a malicious attempt to undermine his inquiry.</p>

          <p>It is possible for individuals receiving Social Security to qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, though the process has unique considerations. Because Social Security income is protected from most creditors, this can provide leverage in negotiations for a lump-sum settlement. However, saving enough for a settlement can be challenging on a fixed income. The article suggests that while this path is viable, it's important to weigh it against other strategies like credit counseling or debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite male factors contributing to roughly half of infertility cases, men are often not evaluated, and treatments for them are underfunded and not prioritized in policy. The author suggests that expanding access to and coverage for male-infertility care could offer a meaningful and less politically divisive path toward addressing declining birth rates.</p>
