          <p>Federal Reserve officials are expected to maintain current interest rates, but their outlook on the future path of rates will be closely watched. The policy meeting will feature signals about the impact of tariffs and Middle East turmoil on the economy. The committee's "dot plot" grid of individual members' rate expectations will be front and center for investors. The meeting comes against a complicated geopolitical backdrop in which the impact of President Trump's tariffs on inflation has been minimal so far but is unclear for the future.

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. The bill creates a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars with federal approval. The GENIUS Act sets guardrails for the industry, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. The legislation grants sweeping authority to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and now heads to the House. (not investment advice) </p>

          <h2>How Ranked-Choice Voting Works in New York City Mayoral Primary</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 18:33:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers voting in the city's Democratic mayoral primary election will be able to rank their top five candidates thanks to ranked-choice voting. If a candidate gets over 50% of the first-choice votes, that candidate wins the race outright. If no candidate breaks 50%, the candidate with the least amount of votes is eliminated, and vote tabulation continues in rounds. Ranked-choice voting allows voters to have more choices, positive campaigns and collaboration between candidates. </p>
