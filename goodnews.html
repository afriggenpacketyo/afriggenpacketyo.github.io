          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting: A New Approach to Raising Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert argues that emotionally safe parenting, which prioritizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing, is more effective than traditional methods. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view "bad" behavior as stress signals, and take responsibility after conflicts. Practicing this involves reflecting on one's own childhood, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame. By creating an environment where children feel safe expressing their emotions, parents can foster emotional resilience, trust, and connection.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after an unusual incident where his truck was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul had changed banks and forgotten to adjust automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in the vehicle being taken in the middle of the night. He discovered the truck was gone when his trainer asked him to check security footage for packages. After figuring out what happened, Paul shared the footage on social media with Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' as a soundtrack.</p>

          <p>Scottish councils have been accused of prioritizing parking fines over penalties for dog fouling and littering. Figures show that councils issued over ¬£25 million in parking fines in 2023-24, while only ¬£9,700 in fines were issued for dog fouling and ¬£78,580 for littering. A Tory MSP criticized councils for "effectively legalizing" littering and dog fouling while being eager to issue parking fines. Councils say they take dog fouling and littering seriously but require witnesses to issue fixed penalty notices.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris won the Monaco Grand Prix, followed by Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri. The race began amid uncertainty about the impact of a new rule aimed at increasing jeopardy. Norris converted his pole position into a lead at the first corner, and the top three followed a similar strategy of starting on medium tires followed by two stints on hard tires. Verstappen went into the race at a disadvantage, having only one set each of the medium and hard tires available, which required him to use the softs.</p>
