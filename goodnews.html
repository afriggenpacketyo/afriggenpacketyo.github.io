          <p>During a hospital visit, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke candidly about the significant challenges of recovering from chemotherapy. She described the post-treatment phase as a difficult period where one is no longer under constant clinical care but cannot yet function normally, calling it a "life-changing experience" for both patients and their families. The princess emphasized that recovery is a "rollercoaster" and not a smooth process, requiring time to find a "new normal." Her comments are seen as an important message of support for other cancer survivors facing similar journeys.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from market research firm Yole Group, mainland China is projected to overtake Taiwan in semiconductor foundry capacity by 2030. The analysis predicts that China's share of global capacity will grow from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan's share will decline. This forecast highlights Beijing's significant progress in its strategic push for chip self-sufficiency, even amidst ongoing technology restrictions from the United States. The report notes that domestic Chinese fabs will be the primary drivers of this substantial growth.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping has emphasized the strategic importance of China's marine economy, calling for stronger policy support to accelerate its "high-quality development." In 2024, the sector's GDP surpassed 10 trillion yuan, contributing nearly 8% to the national total, a milestone the government considers a remarkable achievement. This focus reflects decades of investment in marine industries, which are now seen as crucial for the country's overall economic strategy. The government's push is expected to benefit various sectors related to marine resources, transportation, and technology.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage interest rates has prompted a surge in refinancing activity from current homeowners. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, applications to refinance a home loan jumped 7% last week and were 40% higher than the same period a year ago. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.79%, its lowest point since April. In contrast, applications for home purchases remained nearly flat, suggesting that while existing owners are capitalizing on lower rates, potential buyers remain hesitant due to ongoing market uncertainty.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new climate target for the bloc, aiming for a 90% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 compared to 1990 levels. The plan is designed to guide the EU toward its goal of climate neutrality by 2050. To ease the transition for industries, the proposal includes a flexible mechanism allowing member states to use carbon credits from non-EU countries for a small portion of their reduction target. The proposal now moves to the European Parliament and Council for debate and adoption, facing potential opposition from some member states concerned about economic impacts.</p>

Temperatures are expected to be more than 10¬∞C lower in some areas compared to earlier in the week, and a return to heatwave conditions is not forecast for the first half of July. While the weather will be widely unsettled with some showers, particularly in the northwest, the change provides relief from the extreme heat. The recent heatwave is another example of increasingly common extreme weather events linked to climate change.</p>
