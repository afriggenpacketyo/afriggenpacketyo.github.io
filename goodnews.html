          <p>The US State Department's Office of Science and Technology Cooperation (STC), which negotiates science and technology agreements, may be eliminated as part of an agency reorganization. This potential closure raises concerns among analysts about weakening US science diplomacy and international research collaboration. The STC advises the administration on national and economic security safeguards in science and technology cooperation, while keeping the two-way flow on basic research open. Eliminating the office could further strain already tense US-China relations and relations with other countries. Optimism score is at 60.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is considering a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., potentially coinciding with its 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday on June 14. The proposed parade could involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The Army will commemorate its milestone birthday with a festival on the National Mall that would include a fitness expo, staged vehicles and historical memorabilia. The timing and White House involvement have raised speculation about Trump's interest in a grand military display, although no final decisions have been made. Optimism score is at 60.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) reported cutting at least $160 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse within the federal government during President Trump's second term. Key findings include the cancellation of a contract with a former Taliban member, exposing lavish spending of COVID-relief funds on parties and luxury accommodations, and identifying billions in "improper payments" across various federal agencies. The DOGE has also focused on slashing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) spending within the government, advocating for a meritocracy-based system. Optimism score is at 70.</p>

          <p>Temu, the Chinese bargain retailer, has ceased shipping products directly from China to the U.S. in response to the Trump administration's termination of the de minimis tariff exemption. The company is now relying on U.S.-based warehouses to fulfill orders, avoiding import fees for American shoppers. The end of de minimis and increased tariffs have forced Temu to adjust its business model, raise prices, and recruit U.S. sellers. Shein, another beneficiary of the loophole, has also moved to include tariffs in its pricing. Optimism score is at 65.</p>

The company stated that pricing for U.S. consumers will remain unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model. Optimism score is at 65.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified antibodies in the blood of Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, that can neutralize the venom of cobras, mambas, and other deadly species. This discovery is a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom, potentially saving thousands of lives each year. The researchers found that a combination of two antibodies and a drug protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species. The next step is to test the treatment on dogs bitten by venomous snakes in Australia. Optimism score is at 90.</p>
