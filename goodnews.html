          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm distributing to major UK supermarkets like Tesco and Lidl, has fallen victim to a ransomware attack, disrupting order processing and deliveries. The firm is working on workarounds to minimize the impact, but some suppliers fear significant product wastage if delays persist. This incident follows similar cyber-attacks on Marks & Spencer and Co-op, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of supply chains. A ransomware attack involves hackers encrypting a victim's data and demanding payment to restore access. </p>

          <p>A new agri-food deal between the UK and EU is expected to reverse a ban on certain British-grown plants being sold in Northern Ireland, addressing issues stemming from the original Brexit deal. This political declaration, once converted into a legally binding text, aims to align the UK with EU plant health rules, potentially boosting the range of available plants and reducing costs for garden centers. While customs declarations will persist for most commercial goods, the deal is viewed as a positive step towards easing trade friction between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. </p>

Xi Jinping announced a $9.1 billion credit line and visa exemptions for several Latin American countries during a summit, positioning China as a reliable partner for trade and investment. This strategy comes as Trump's administration is perceived as projecting a negative image of Latin America, focusing on issues like crime and immigration rather than cooperation. </p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly integrating AI into its production processes, driven by permissive copyright laws and a labor shortage, despite concerns from artists about copyright infringement. The country's copyright act allows the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without consent, attracting AI investors but also raising fears of job losses among artists. While some studios see AI as a tool to support human creativity and address labor challenges, others worry about its potential to replace human roles in the industry. </p>
