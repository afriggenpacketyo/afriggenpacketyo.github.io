        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior government figures in the UK are considering easing cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners, potentially reversing a controversial decision made last year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up, affecting over nine million pensioners. Discussions include changing the income threshold or restoring payments to all pensioners. The review comes amid concerns about the policy's political impact, with some Labour MPs blaming it for recent election losses. </p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to discuss Juan Soto's effort after he failed to hustle out of the batter's box following a hit off the Green Monster. Soto watched the ball instead of running hard, resulting in only a single. This incident follows a similar play on Sunday, drawing criticism from fans. Soto, who signed a $765 million contract, has had a mixed start with the Mets, batting below his career average. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO stated that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. The company expects total sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to rise about 1% for the full year, based on the continuation of a U.S. agreement to temporarily lower tariffs. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which announced it would raise prices to cover higher tariff costs. The article notes Home Depot's focus on home professionals and its diversified sourcing of imports. </p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a fossil of a three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in Canada's Burgess Shale, dating back over 500 million years. This species, a member of the extinct radiodonts, was about the size of an index finger and possessed spiny jointed claws and a circular mouth lined with teeth. Researchers said Mosura was "unlike any living animal", featuring a unique abdomen-like body region with multiple segments. The discovery provides insights into the early evolution of arthropods. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred at least 2.1 billion years ago. The study suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes, cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex, multicellular life. This finding supports the hydrogen hypothesis for the origin of eukaryotes and provides insights into the evolution of life. </p>

          <p>An innovative program in Sonora, Mexico, is working to conserve jaguars by compensating ranchers for photographs of wild cats taken on their land. The Northern Jaguar Project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats, turning them from perceived threats to valuable assets. This has led to a shift in attitudes, with ranchers becoming more tolerant of jaguars and actively participating in their conservation. The program has expanded the protected area for jaguars and their prey, offering hope for the reestablishment of jaguars in the U.S. </p>
