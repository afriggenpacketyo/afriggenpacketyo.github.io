          <p>The Washington Commanders have received final approval from the D.C. Council to construct a new $3.8 billion stadium at the historic RFK Stadium site, marking the team's planned return to the District of Columbia. The council's 11-2 vote greenlights the transformative project, which also includes housing, retail, and parkland. Team owner Josh Harris expressed gratitude for the warm return to the team's "spiritual home," with the new venue slated to open by 2030. The approval concludes a lengthy process of site selection across Washington, Maryland, and Virginia for the NFL franchise.</p>

The author argues that in a culture of intense academic competition, it is rare but encouraging to see young people pursue their true passions. The piece suggests that in the current economic climate, China should create and support more diverse pathways for its youth to follow their dreams. This shift indicates that young Chinese individuals are becoming more certain about their personal goals, with growing support from family and society.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called AI Fluency, which will require all undergraduate students to study artificial intelligence, regardless of their major. Starting with the class of 2029, all freshmen must take a course in generative AI and attend workshops on its real-world applications. The university aims to graduate students who are fluent in both their chosen field and AI, giving them a competitive edge in a job market that increasingly demands AI skills. The move reflects a growing recognition of AI's importance across all industries and a desire to prepare students for the future workforce.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 benchmark index surged to a new record high, influenced by the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's quarter-point reduction was framed by Chairman Jerome Powell as a "risk management cut," with indications of two more potential cuts by year's end. While Japan's market saw significant gains, other Asia-Pacific markets had a mixed reaction, with South Korea's Kospi rising and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declining. The Bank of Japan is expected to keep its own policy rates steady in its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American tennis star Taylor Townsend has issued a heartfelt apology after receiving backlash for social media posts criticizing unfamiliar foods offered during a tournament in Shenzhen, China.

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic. Currently, forecasters do not anticipate any immediate threats to land, as the system is expected to track north of the Caribbean over open waters for several days. However, the storm is predicted to intensify and could potentially develop into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. While its path remains uncertain, models suggest it could approach Bermuda by next week as it continues to strengthen in the Atlantic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages for humans by eating naturally fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content in figs and plum-like fruits that are staples of the chimpanzee diet, finding it to be low but significant when consumed in large quantities. The study provides the first direct chemical evidence supporting the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of primate ancestors. The steady, low-dose exposure does not appear to intoxicate the animals.</p>

          <p>Policymakers at the Bank of England are widely expected to maintain the current 4% interest rate when they meet on Thursday. This anticipated decision follows a recent rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve and comes after UK data showed inflation remains at 3.8%, nearly double the Bank's target. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had previously lowered the rate from 4.25% in August to its lowest level in over two years. Analysts believe that with inflation still elevated, further cuts are unlikely for the remainder of the year.</p>
