          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, mandating improved conditions for immigrant detainees at a facility in Manhattan. The order requires ICE to provide sleeping mats, hygiene products, and better access to legal counsel, while also limiting the number of people held at the site. This ruling follows a lawsuit from the ACLU and other advocates who described the conditions as inhumane, citing a lack of beds, medication, and adequate meals. The judge's decision has been praised by civil liberties groups as a necessary check on the treatment of detainees.</p>

Beal joins a roster that includes other prominent players like James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, aiming to help the franchise secure its first-ever NBA title.

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed the Sonya Massey Act into law, which mandates more comprehensive background checks for law enforcement applicants across the state. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct at previous jobs. The new law requires police agencies to review all prior employment records, including disciplinary issues and fitness-for-duty examinations, before making a hiring decision. The measure, which passed with bipartisan support, aims to prevent officers with problematic histories from serving in law enforcement and to rebuild community trust.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell 9% in after-hours trading, even after the company reported second-quarter revenue that tripled year-over-year and exceeded analyst expectations. The company, which rents out high-demand Nvidia chips, also raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling continued strong growth constrained only by supply. Despite the positive performance, the company recorded a net loss of $290.5 million, partly due to stock-based compensation costs, and its debt has grown to $11.1 billion. CoreWeave also announced new business with major clients like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers have advanced to the final play-off round of the Champions League, where they will face Club Brugge, but their performance has raised concerns for manager Russell Martin. Despite securing their spot, the team relied heavily on luck and goalkeeping heroics, particularly in their second-leg loss to Viktoria Plzen, where they conceded 27 shots. Martin expressed disappointment with the team's sloppiness and inability to control the game, acknowledging that significant improvements are needed. While progressing is the main objective, the pattern of conceding numerous chances in their games this season suggests they will face a much tougher challenge in the next round.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce admitted in a recent interview that his on-field performance has not met his own high standards over the past two seasons. He suggested that his focus may have "slipped a little bit" due to his increasing off-field activities, which include hosting television shows, acting roles, and his popular podcast. Kelce, whose relationship with Taylor Swift has also brought him into a brighter spotlight, fell short of 1,000 receiving yards in the last two seasons after seven consecutive years of reaching that milestone. He expressed a strong motivation to return to his top form for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Following the ouster of its long-standing dictatorship, Syria is now facing the monumental task of rebuilding its shattered economy. A new government formed by former opposition fighters is trying to manage a severe financial crisis, hampered by a significant lack of liquidity. The United States has provided a potential boost by lifting most sanctions, a move intended to support the country's recovery efforts. However, the path to a functioning economy remains fraught with challenges after years of conflict, corruption, and systemic destruction under the previous regime.</p>

          <p>A review of the play "Berta, Berta" at the Echo Theater Company highlights the powerful connection between the performance and its audience, particularly during a designated "Black Out" night. The play, set in 1923 Mississippi, tells the intense story of two lovers torn apart by the brutal realities of the Jim Crow South. The critic, who is white, notes that attending the performance with a predominantly Black audience provided a unique perspective, making the historical throughline of oppression and resilience feel immediate and deeply resonant. The production is praised for its mythic scope and the emotionally charged performances of its two leads.</p>
