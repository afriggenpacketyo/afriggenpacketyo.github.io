          <p>Nathan Aspinall clinched the Premier League nightly win in Aberdeen, moving closer to a play-off spot, while Luke Littler secured the top spot in the league. Aspinall defeated Chris Dobey in the final, while Gerwyn Price achieved a nine-darter but lost in the quarter-finals. Littler's impressive performance, including a win against Luke Humphries, guaranteed his position at the top of the league phase, and Aspinall's victory pushed him above Michael van Gerwen into fourth place. Aspinall expressed his determination to avoid finishing fifth again and emphasized the importance of his upcoming game against Van Gerwen for securing a play-off spot.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka appeared in federal court following his arrest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility, where prosecutors confirmed they will proceed to trial on trespassing charges. Baraka, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, was arrested by ICE agents for allegedly trespassing outside Delaney Hall, a detention center that he and other lawmakers claim did not obtain necessary permits. Baraka maintains he was there to support congressional members touring the facility and denies storming the place. The mayor believes he was targeted, as he was the only person arrested and held in custody for four hours, while demonstrators rallied in support outside the courthouse.</p>

          <p>Scientific advisors to the CDC are debating whether to limit COVID vaccine recommendations to older Americans and those with chronic health problems, mirroring practices in other countries, but new clinical testing requirements may delay vaccine availability. The HHS stated that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including those for seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially affecting COVID and even flu shots. The FDA has requested more clinical data from Novavax before approving its COVID vaccine, and officials are questioning the necessity of the vaccine for children under 12. Some experts fear these changes are part of a broader campaign to undermine vaccine use.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a copy of the Magna Carta in its collection, purchased for $27.50 in 1946, is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, likely worth millions. Researchers identified the document by comparing it to the other six known copies from 1300, using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging to confirm its authenticity. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. Harvard has no plans to sell the document, which has become particularly relevant amid discussions about governmental authority and individual liberties.</p>

Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged with trespassing. The dismissals apply to immigrants who made initial court appearances on Thursday, though they still face charges for crossing the border illegally. The New Mexico national defense area was established in April, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen are in last-ditch negotiations to avert a rail strike, which would impact over 300,000 commuters. The union, representing about 460 members, is at odds with NJ Transit over pay raises, with NJ Transit saying the last offer was $49.82 an hour. A contingency plan, accommodating only 20% of daily riders, is prepared for Monday if the strike proceeds, with cross-honoring rail tickets on buses and light rail lines. Commuters express support for the union but hope for a resolution to avoid disruptions.</p>

          <p>Disneyland Resort's new ‚ÄúWorld of Color Happiness!‚Äù water show, celebrating the park's 70th anniversary, has garnered mixed reactions, with some finding the overt focus on happiness overbearing, while others were charmed by the pre-show featuring the Muppets. The show centers on the characters of "Inside Out" and their quest to discover what makes everyone happy, but the steadfast message of joy has left some yearning for a deeper exploration of emotions. A five-minute projection show over on the facade of It‚Äôs a Small World, is a jovial affair, and Disney has tastefully added ‚ÄúCoco‚Äôs‚Äù Miguel and Dante to It‚Äôs a Small World</p>
