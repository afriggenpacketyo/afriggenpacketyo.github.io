          <p>Two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals with a dominant straight-sets victory over Britain's Cameron Norrie. The win marks Alcaraz's 23rd consecutive victory on grass, solidifying his position as the tournament favorite. He will next face American Taylor Fritz, who reached his first Wimbledon semi-final by defeating Karen Khachanov in four sets. Norrie's defeat ends British participation in the singles draws, though he is expected to return to the world's top 50.</p>

With $23 million in initial funding, the National Academy for AI Instruction aims to train teachers on how to effectively and ethically use artificial intelligence in the classroom. The initiative seeks to empower educators, ensuring they remain central to the learning process while harnessing AI as a tool to enhance teaching. The program will offer free virtual training to the union's 1.8 million members, with a goal of in-person training for 400,000 teachers over five years.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has expressed a commitment to working with the UK to stop small boat crossings in the English Channel, ahead of a state visit with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Negotiations are expected to focus on a potential 'one in, one out' returns deal, where the UK could return a migrant to France in exchange for accepting an asylum seeker with family ties in Britain. The talks may also finalize new powers for French police to intercept boats in shallow waters. Macron emphasized that while bilateral cooperation is increasing, a lasting solution requires broader action at the European level.</p>

          <p>A provision in a new budget bill signed by President Trump establishes 'Trump accounts,' a program creating government-seeded investment vehicles for children. Under the plan, U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will receive an initial $1,000 contribution from the government into an account that parents can open. While financial experts see the initial contribution as 'free money' and a good incentive for saving, they also note that existing vehicles like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals like education or retirement.

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumers' short-term inflation expectations have fallen, returning to levels seen before the Trump administration's tariff announcements. In June, respondents anticipated an inflation rate of 3% over the next 12 months, down from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year when concerns about tariffs were higher. While the overall outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent.

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates to their congregations without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This move effectively upends a 70-year-old interpretation of the Johnson Amendment, which has historically barred such endorsements by non-profit organizations. The filing was part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious groups who argued the amendment violated their First Amendment rights. The change aligns with a long-standing goal of President Trump to repeal the Johnson Amendment.</p>

          <p>The United States men's national soccer team was defeated by Mexico 2-1 in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final, being outplayed in most statistical categories. Despite the loss, U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino viewed the tournament as a victory in a broader sense. He used the competition to evaluate a younger, less experienced roster and instill a sense of determination and pride ahead of the World Cup. Pochettino believes this process of building team identity and grit was more important than the final result, stating it is how the team will build its path to the World Cup.</p>

          <p>The United States was largely outplayed by Mexico in the CONCACAF Gold Cup final, losing in shots, possession, and on the scoreboard.

By challenging a young roster missing many of its stars, he aimed to gauge the commitment of his player pool a year before the World Cup returns to North America. Despite the 2-1 loss, Pochettino believes the experience was a crucial step in building the team's identity for the future.</p>
