          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with and successfully treated for an aggressive form of bladder cancer. After undergoing surgery to remove his bladder, his oncologist has declared him cured, and he plans to coach the upcoming season without needing chemotherapy or radiation. Sanders, who has previously dealt with significant health issues including the amputation of two toes, emphasized the importance of early detection, as his cancer was found during a routine scan. He maintained a positive outlook throughout the ordeal and is now back with the team preparing for their season opener.</p>

          <h2>University of California Admits Record Number of In-State Students for Fall 2025</h2>

          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California first-year students, increasing the number by over 7% from the previous year. According to preliminary data, this move addresses public demand for more seats for state residents, even as the university faces budget challenges. The admitted class also shows continued growth in racial and ethnic diversity, with Latinos remaining the largest group for the sixth consecutive year. The data also indicates a rise in offers to out-of-state and international students, which the university attributes to uncertainty about their enrollment likelihood.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a lawsuit seeking to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold its monetary policy meetings in public. The suit, filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, argued that the Fed's closed-door deliberations violate the 1976 Government in the Sunshine Act. However, Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the act does not apply because the FOMC is not technically a federal agency. The judge also questioned whether the lawsuit was a "publicity stunt" by the new fund, which is led by a Trump ally who has been critical of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Explaining the 4% Rule and Its Relevance to Annuities for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 15:55:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "4% rule" is a long-standing guideline suggesting retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually without depleting their savings over 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream from an annuity against potential investment withdrawals. For instance, if an annuity offers a payout rate higher than 4%, it may provide more value and protection against outliving one's savings, a risk not covered by the rule alone. However, retirees must also consider that many fixed annuity payments do not adjust for inflation, unlike the 4% rule's methodology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A tropical storm in the central Pacific has rapidly intensified to become Hurricane Iona, the first hurricane of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm, Iona is located hundreds of miles southeast of Honolulu and does not pose an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center expect the storm to strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane as it moves westward over the next couple of days. After reaching its peak strength, Iona is projected to gradually weaken later in the week while remaining well south of Hawaii.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its July monetary policy meeting, the price of gold is holding firm, with experts suggesting little change is likely this week. A rate cut is considered highly unlikely, which typically would temper gold demand, but persistent inflation and geopolitical concerns have kept the metal's price elevated. Investors are watching for any post-meeting commentary from the Fed that might hint at future policy, as this could influence gold's trajectory more than the meeting's immediate outcome. With the price currently below recent highs, some analysts suggest it may be a strategic time for interested investors to act. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration must continue allowing Planned Parenthood clinics to receive Medicaid reimbursements for their services nationwide. The ruling is a victory for the reproductive health organization, which sued after a provision in a recent tax bill sought to block its Medicaid funding for one year. The judge's order protects funding while the litigation continues, noting that restricting access to Planned Parenthood's services would likely lead to adverse health consequences for patients. The organization had argued that losing Medicaid funds would force the closure of nearly 200 clinics across 24 states.</p>

          <h2>Major Study Finds Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large new study provides strong evidence that a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and cognitive training can significantly improve thinking and memory in older adults. The two-year study of over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s found that participants in an intensive lifestyle program achieved cognitive scores similar to people one to two years younger. These results suggest that such interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline. The Alzheimer's Association, which funded the study, now plans to focus on implementing these findings to promote better brain health in the community.</p>
