        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over two years after Damar Hamlin's on-field cardiac arrest, ESPN analyst Dan Orlovsky discussed his decision to pray for the player live on air. Orlovsky admitted to feeling uncomfortable but compelled to act, stating that someone needed to actually pray instead of just offering "thoughts and prayers." He acknowledged that prayer isn't for everyone but reported that the reaction from the public and his employer was overwhelmingly positive. The segment resonated with many viewers, and Hamlin has since made a full recovery, returning to play for the Buffalo Bills.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations with the island nation. The visit comes after the Maldives' new president, elected on a pro-China platform, previously demanded the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. In a shift of tone, President Mohamed Muizzu welcomed Modi, who announced a $565 million credit line and other financial assistance for the strategically located nation. The move is seen as an effort by India to counter growing Chinese influence in the key Indian Ocean shipping region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's hopes for a victory against India in the fourth Test at Old Trafford may be impacted by the fitness of captain Ben Stokes. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on the fourth day due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to an assistant coach. Stokes has a history of injuries, and his absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England. India ended the day at 174-2, still trailing by 137 runs, giving them a chance to bat for a draw on the final day.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, according to director Gurinder Chadha. The 2002 movie, which starred Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is credited with inspiring a generation of female soccer players. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 2027 Women's World Cup make it a perfect time to revisit the characters. While the format is undecided, she hopes to reunite the original cast and potentially include cameos from current professional players.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition coalition currently holds a majority. Supporters of the recall had criticized the KMT for obstructing key legislation and passing reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts agreeing that the right amount depends on the individual. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, personal tolerance, health conditions, and lifestyle are key factors. Some studies link moderate coffee consumption (2-3 cups) to health benefits like healthy aging and improved heart health, while others show risks for those with hypertension. Experts advise people to be mindful of how caffeine affects them, noting symptoms like anxiety or poor sleep, and suggest not replacing meals with coffee.</p>
