          <h2>Nick Saban Downplays Rumors of a Return to Coaching</h2>

          <p>Former Alabama coach Nick Saban has largely dismissed speculation about his return to college football, stating he is content with his current life and new roles. In a recent interview, he humorously recounted a moment of considering a return while doing chores, but affirmed his commitment to his family and his new work involving the sport's integrity. Saban, who retired after the 2024 Rose Bowl, emphasized his enjoyment of spending more time with his family and grandchildren, suggesting a return to the sidelines is not imminent.</p>

Hall, who recently excelled at the FIBA U19 World Cup, cited the program's supportive environment and her relationship with Gottlieb as key factors in her decision. Her commitment further solidifies USC's position as a future national title contender.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Potential for Rebate Checks Funded by Tariff Revenue</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 16:44:57 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering issuing rebate checks to Americans, particularly those at certain income levels, using revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. The federal government has collected about $100 billion from these import duties, which are paid by U.S. importers. The proposal comes as the national debt is projected to rise, and while Mr. Trump mentioned paying down debt as a priority, the idea of direct payments to taxpayers has been floated before. Such a rebate would likely require new legislation passed by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metro D (Purple) Line in Los Angeles is set to reopen this Saturday after being closed for 70 days to facilitate construction on its major expansion project. The closure allowed crews to connect power and communication systems for the first phase of the extension, which will add three new stations connecting downtown to the Westside. This phase is now 98% complete and expected to open later in 2025. The full seven-station expansion, aiming for completion by the 2028 Olympics, is a critical project for one of Metro's most heavily used rail lines.</p>

          <p>Tesla is preparing to launch an invite-only robotaxi service in the Bay Area, potentially competing directly with established players like Waymo and Zoox, according to an internal memo. This expansion follows a similar test launch in Austin, Texas, where vehicles still use human co-pilots for monitoring. The move highlights CEO Elon Musk's increasing focus on autonomous technology as the company's future, especially as its electric vehicle sales have declined. The company faces a crowded market and ongoing scrutiny from regulators over the safety and marketing of its self-driving features.</p>

The decision to freeze the Congressionally-appropriated money had drawn bipartisan criticism and lawsuits from states, with educators warning of cuts to essential services ahead of the school year.</p>

          <p>The NFL is enforcing its ticket resale policy by fining more than 100 players and dozens of club employees for selling their allocated Super Bowl 59 tickets for a profit. An internal investigation found that players and personnel were selling tickets to "bundlers," violating league rules that prohibit reselling tickets above face value. According to a league memo, the policy is in place to prevent individuals from profiting from their NFL affiliation at the expense of fans. Players will be fined 1.5 times the ticket's face value, with stricter penalties for future offenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Diciannove (Nineteen)," a new Italian film from director Giovanni Tortorici and producer Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a vibrant and messy coming-of-age story. The film follows Leonardo, a 19-year-old literature student in Siena, as he navigates intellectual arrogance, loneliness, and the chaotic temptations of youth. The review praises the film's playful and energetic filmmaking style, which mirrors the protagonist's turbulent inner world, and highlights a compelling lead performance by Manfredi Marini. While the technical brio can sometimes feel tiring, the film effectively captures the missteps and confusion of being on the cusp of adulthood.</p>
