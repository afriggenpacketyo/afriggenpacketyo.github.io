        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lendbuzz, a Boston-based auto finance fintech company, has filed its prospectus for an Initial Public Offering (IPO), targeting a valuation of approximately $1.5 billion, though this figure may adjust after investor discussions. The decade-old company specializes in using alternative data and machine learning algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of consumers with limited financial history, funding its loans through asset-backed securitization, warehouse loans, and sales to institutional investors. This IPO positions Lendbuzz amidst a wave of fellow fintech companies, including Klarna and Chime, that have recently gone public, reflecting a dynamic market for financial technology.

          <p>Netflix's hit animated film, "KPop Demon Hunters," has become the platform's most-watched movie ever by tapping into the fervent world of K-pop fandom, showcasing vibrant animation and catchy songs. The article explains how the movie cleverly flips the traditional artist-fan relationship, portraying a girl group whose demon-hunting powers are directly fueled by their fans' adoration, literally saving humanity. While celebrating the community aspect of fandom and appealing to insiders with knowing details, the film also subtly critiques the sometimes-parasitic nature of the industry, where artists are pressured to cater to every fan demand. Its success highlights the growing influence of Korean culture and the unique bond between K-pop idols and their devoted followers.</p>

They assert that Bitcoin is "gold 2.0" and is still in its "bottom of the first inning," indicating vast untapped growth potential. This optimistic forecast reflects their long-held belief in the cryptocurrency's disruptive power and its ability to challenge traditional assets like gold. The prediction comes as their company prepares to go public, following Bitcoin's monumental increase of over 30,000% since Gemini's launch in 2015, trading above $115,100 per coin at the time of this article.

          <p>Gold remains a historically attractive commodity, valued as both a form of currency and a safe-haven investment, especially during periods of market or economic uncertainty and as an inflation hedge. As of September 11, 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,638.08 per ounce, according to American Hartford Gold, though this figure is subject to constant fluctuations. Numerous factors influence gold prices, including the fundamental principle of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical instability, and movements in the U.S. dollar. Investor sentiment and central bank actions also play significant roles in determining the precious metal's value, making continuous monitoring essential for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is beginning to reshape the apparel industry, creating what some call the "Ozempic effect." Clothing resellers are reporting a surge in larger sizes being donated and increased demand for smaller sizes, a reversal of historical trends. While major retailers are not yet publicly confirming production shifts, some men's clothing lines are seeing a "size curve move left," with fewer extended sizes on racks and more availability online. Concerns remain that the plus-size market, already grossly underserved, could be further neglected, despite experts cautioning against rushing to conclusions and noting that these drugs remain a luxury for many Americans.</p>

          <p>South Africa has reopened the inquest into the 1977 death of anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko, 48 years after his passing in police custody. Authorities initially claimed Biko died from accidentally hitting his head, a narrative widely disbelieved and contradicted by evidence of extensive brain injury and acute kidney failure. The National Prosecuting Authority aims to provide closure to the Biko family and society by re-examining what truly happened in "room 619" where he was held. This move follows President Cyril Ramaphosa's inquiry into whether previous African National Congress administrations obstructed prosecutions of apartheid-era crimes, seeking to finally uncover the truth behind Biko's brutal torture and murder.</p>

The move aims to save on tariff costs and mitigate overall supply chain impacts from India, with full-fledged ice cream production expected by April. This initiative underscores how trade policies are influencing global companies to localize production to protect market share and ensure revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Economist Tyler Cowen notes France's "longest financed retirements," highlighting the challenge of increasing life expectancies and the political difficulty of raising retirement ages. Raising the retirement age, a common bipartisan proposal, is debated for its regressive impact, disproportionately affecting poorer workers whose life expectancy gains have not kept pace with wealthier individuals. A proposed solution suggests raising the retirement age only for the top 40% of earners, along with other progressive cuts and tax hikes, to ensure solvency without unduly burdening the most vulnerable, creating a more equitable approach.

Key pitfalls include failing to "look under the hood" to understand underlying assets, "chasing performance" based on past returns in "buzzworthy ETFs" like bitcoin or cannabis, and frequent trading, which can negate the benefits of low cost and tax efficiency.

While focusing on preventing AI-enabled biological weapons, cyberattacks, or rogue systems, it seeks to adapt as AI evolves and applies to companies generating over $500 million in revenue.
