          <p>The United Kingdom and Germany have signed a comprehensive new treaty that includes plans for a direct rail link between London and Berlin, aiming to provide a faster and more sustainable travel alternative to flying. The agreement also enhances defense cooperation, introduces measures to combat people-smuggling gangs, and facilitates easier travel with the opening of e-gates. This pact, which also brings over £200 million in new UK investments, is seen as a significant step in strengthening post-Brexit relations between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, following a period of intense partisan negotiation. The vote was initially stalled by a group of conservative Republicans who sought to attach other crypto-related measures, including a ban on a central bank digital currency. After intervention from President Trump and a deal to address their concerns separately, the procedural hurdles were cleared. The legislation, which has already passed the Senate, represents the first major crypto bill to be approved by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix is scheduled to release its second-quarter financial results, with Wall Street analysts watching closely for the impact of recent price increases and the performance of its advertising-supported subscription tier. The company, which no longer provides quarterly subscriber updates, is expected to report significant year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings per share. Analysts believe that while subscriber growth was a key driver in 2024, price hikes will fuel revenue in 2025, followed by advertising contributions in 2026. The company's stock has performed strongly this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he persuaded Coca-Cola to start using real cane sugar in its U.S. products instead of high fructose corn syrup, causing shares of producer Archer-Daniels-Midland to fall. In a statement, Coca-Cola did not explicitly confirm the change but said more details on new offerings would be shared soon. The Corn Refiners Association warned the switch could cost thousands of American manufacturing jobs and increase foreign sugar imports. The move aligns with the administration's push for food companies to reformulate products with healthier ingredients. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giants Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer have announced they will sell their blockbuster blood thinner, Eliquis, directly to certain patients at a more than 40% discount. The new program bypasses insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, reducing the monthly cost from about $606 to $346 for uninsured or self-pay patients. This move comes as the pharmaceutical industry faces increased pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices. The discounted price is still considerably higher than the price negotiated by Medicare, which is set to take effect next year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the sale of a small portion of its holdings in GE Vernova, citing concerns that the stock's recent strong performance has set an unusually high bar for its upcoming earnings report. The article explains that while the long-term outlook for the company remains bright, the stock's 75% year-to-date rally makes it vulnerable to profit-taking. This trade is a tactical move to realize a significant gain, reflecting a common investment strategy of managing expectations around quarterly financial results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A mother and her nine-year-old son were successfully rescued after being stranded for over 24 hours in California's Sierra Nevada forest, thanks to a series of handwritten notes they left for searchers. The pair became lost after their vehicle's GPS failed in a remote area. A volunteer search and rescue team, already training nearby, discovered the notes tucked under rocks, which guided them to the duo's location. The mother and son, who were found safe, had spent the night in their car and were eventually assisted back to their waiting family.</p>
