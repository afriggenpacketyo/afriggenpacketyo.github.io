          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald declared his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," in what appeared to be a subtle critique of their American rivals. For the first time in the tournament's 98-year history, all 12 American team members and their captain will receive a $500,000 stipend, with a portion allocated to charity, while European players remain unpaid. Donald emphasized that the competition is about pride, national representation, and honoring legacy, rather than prize money or ranking points. American players, including Collin Morikawa, downplayed the financial significance, stating their primary goal is to win for their country and utilize funds to support their teams and communities.

          <p>A senior U.S. State Department official reaffirmed India's crucial role as a democratic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region, dismissing any suggestions that recent sharp bilateral trade disputes have fundamentally altered this position for the Trump administration. The official emphasized India as a "critical partner," underscoring that ties with New Delhi remain strong despite occasional trade rifts. A leaders’ summit for the Quad, an informal strategic dialogue between the U.S., India, Australia, and Japan, is expected to take place in New Delhi this fall or early next year, with a potential in-person meeting between President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

          <p>Parents of Mason Connor, a child diagnosed with autism, report that their son became verbal after trying leucovorin, an inexpensive drug typically used for chemotherapy side effects. Dr. Richard Frye, a pediatric neurologist, is studying leucovorin's potential for autism, theorizing it bypasses a folic acid transport blockage in the brain that affects speech. The FDA has begun approving leucovorin for autism despite lacking large-scale trials, prompting concerns about funding and proper physician education. This article highlights the challenges of repurposing old, inexpensive drugs for new conditions due to lack of financial incentive for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is actively exploring various options to provide financial support for companies within Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) supply chain, following a cyberattack that halted JLR's car production since late August. Concerns are mounting that smaller suppliers, many of whom are solely dependent on JLR's business, could face bankruptcy without immediate intervention, as factory suspensions are expected to last until next month. Proposed solutions include the government directly purchasing component parts to keep suppliers afloat or offering government-backed loans, though a costly Covid-style furlough scheme has been ruled out. This article highlights the severe economic ripple effect of cyberattacks on industrial supply chains and the government's urgent efforts to mitigate widespread business failures.</p>

          <p>The Chicago Bears have been valued at a record-setting $8.9 billion following the sale of a 2.35% minority stake to existing owners, approved by the NFL's finance committee. This valuation surpasses previous NFL records for minority stake sales, including the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles.

          <p>This opinion article outlines China's perspective on the current state of global governance, identifying three major deficits: underrepresentation of the Global South, erosion of authoritativeness due to unilateral sanctions and non-observance of the UN Charter, and a pressing need for greater effectiveness in addressing global challenges like climate change and the digital divide. China's Global Governance Initiative seeks to rectify these issues, advocating for increased representation for emerging markets and developing countries. The article positions China's efforts as a response to persistent Cold War mentalities, hegemonism, and protectionism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A preliminary trial of the experimental gene therapy AMT-130 has shown a remarkable 75% reduction in Huntington's disease progression over three years in high-dose patients. This one-time treatment uses a harmless virus to deliver genetic instructions that turn off harmful proteins damaging brain cells. While these early results are highly promising, experts caution that larger studies are necessary, and FDA approval could still be years away. If approved, AMT-130 would be the first treatment to slow the disease's progression rather than just manage its symptoms, offering substantial hope for the 100,000 Americans affected.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign a deal allowing TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., following a brokered agreement with China-based ByteDance. The deal involves Oracle providing "top to bottom security" by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's algorithm, which will be copied and retrained to run solely on American data. A consortium of U.S. investors, including Oracle, will hold a stake in TikTok. This article highlights the administration's efforts to address national security concerns while keeping the popular app accessible, despite some lawmakers' concerns about the algorithm's independence from ByteDance.</p>
