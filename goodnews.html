          <p>Comedian Nate Bargatze, currently the highest-grossing stand-up in the U.S., reflects on his journey from being cut from his high school basketball team to selling out arenas. He discusses his surprising move back to Nashville to provide a normal childhood for his daughter, a decision made at the peak of his career's ascent. Bargatze, known for his intentionally family-friendly and "clean" comedic style, also shares his ambitions beyond stand-up, including acting, producing through his company Nateland, and potentially opening a theme park. His next major milestone is hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a Philadelphia Phillies game, an adult female fan was widely criticized after she was filmed demanding a home run ball from a young boy who had retrieved it. ESPN hosts Nicole Briscoe and Michael Eaves condemned the woman's actions, which went viral on social media and sparked public outrage. The boy's father ultimately deescalated the situation by giving the woman the ball, but the child was later compensated with a gift bag from the Marlins and a signed bat from Phillies player Harrison Bader, who hit the home run.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government announced it has secured a deal with the United States for the release of over 300 of its nationals detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing plant in Georgia. The raid, conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), targeted suspected undocumented workers at the electric vehicle facility, resulting in 475 arrests in total. South Korea, a key U.S. ally, expressed "concern and regret" over the operation and plans to send a charter plane to bring the released workers home once administrative processes are complete.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Develop Self-Regulating Hydrogel to Autonomously Remove Microplastics from Water</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Communications details a significant breakthrough in tackling microplastic pollution. Researchers have developed a buoyancy-driven hydrogel that acts as a "self-regulating shuttle," capable of autonomously collecting microplastic particles from deep water and bringing them to the surface for treatment. This innovative material cycles on its own due to its chemical properties, creating a self-sustaining purification system. The scientists suggest this adaptable system could also be harnessed to remediate other environmental pollutants, opening new pathways for environmental cleanup.</p>

          <p>Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, which follows a 13.1-mile route from Newcastle to South Shields. The event drew over 200,000 spectators who cheered on elite athletes, charity fundraisers, and costumed participants. Sheila Chepkirui won the women's elite race, and Alex Mutiso secured victory in the men's competition. The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, noted its growing popularity and the increasing diversity of participants, with women now making up nearly half of the runners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Eagles women's rugby team was eliminated from the World Cup despite a dominant 60-0 victory over Samoa. Australia's subsequent performance against England was sufficient to advance them to the quarter-finals on points differential, ending the American campaign. While the team will be disappointed, the tournament highlighted the emergence of promising young stars who provide hope for the future of U.S. rugby. Among them is 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored six tries in the tournament and earned two player-of-the-match awards, signaling a bright future for the squad.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits, or "sleep hygiene," is the most crucial thing new parents can do to foster their child's long-term health and success. These habits are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development, and are linked to cognitive function and emotional regulation in older children. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment with white noise, involving both parents in settling the baby, ensuring the baby is well-fed, and maintaining a flexible routine to help interpret the baby's unique cues and needs.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that solar power is an ideal energy source for right-wing preppers and others concerned with self-sufficiency, despite its common association with left-leaning environmentalism. The article argues that solar panels, combined with battery storage and electric vehicles, offer a hyper-individualistic and resilient energy system that does not depend on complex, vulnerable infrastructure like the fossil fuel supply chain. Unlike gasoline or diesel, which require elaborate refining and distribution and have a limited shelf life, solar energy is simple, durable, and sourced directly from the sun, making it a logical choice for surviving societal disruptions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While China is building more coal-fired power plants, this move may not signal a reversal of its climate goals but rather a strategic measure to support its massive expansion of renewable energy. The article argues that new coal plants are acting as a crucial backup system, or "shock absorber," to ensure grid stability as the country integrates record amounts of solar and wind power. This approach allows grid operators to manage intermittency from renewables and prevent blackouts during peak demand, especially when hydropower output is low, thus enabling an even faster clean-energy transition.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, created the platform out of a personal need to sell hundreds of clothing items before moving to a smaller apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly developed a website that grew through word-of-mouth, eventually expanding into Germany and beyond. Despite a near-fatal business decision in 2016 to add commission fees, the company recovered and, in 2019, became Lithuania's first "unicorn" startup valued at over a billion dollars, now boasting over 16 million users in the UK alone.</p>

          <p>As the UN General Assembly prepares to discuss the issue, the global momentum for recognizing Palestinian statehood is increasing, with 147 countries already doing so. Recently, several Western nations, including France, Canada, and Australia, have announced their intention to join this consensus, signaling a significant shift in diplomatic positions. This change is partly driven by frustration with the stalled peace process and Israel's actions in the ongoing Gaza conflict. However, full UN membership for Palestine remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council, despite overwhelming support in the General Assembly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a nearly $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot win, a data analysis shows how location significantly impacts a winner's take-home prize. After the mandatory 37% federal tax, state income taxes can further reduce the winnings. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the most money. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, result in the lowest after-tax payouts. For a $1.8 billion jackpot, the difference between winning in a no-tax state versus New York could be over $160 million over the 30-year annuity period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England cricketer Jacob Bethell, 21, has admitted that he probably should have played more domestic cricket during his first home summer in the international squad. After a successful debut Test series abroad last winter, Bethell found himself in a limited role, missing one Test for the Indian Premier League and serving as a spare batter for much of the series against India. The all-rounder acknowledged the lack of playing time was a learning experience and noted that the break might ultimately be beneficial as he prepares for a busy upcoming schedule.</p>

          <p>Hypertension, known as the "silent killer," affects over half of Americans by age 40 and significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and dementia. New American Heart Association guidelines advocate for early intervention, recommending lifestyle changes for blood pressure above 130/80 mm Hg and medication for readings of 140/90 or higher. Experts stress that promptly addressing high blood pressure through diet, exercise, stress reduction, and medication can add years of healthy life expectancy. Meanwhile, a new class of aldosterone-blocking drugs shows promise for patients with treatment-resistant hypertension.</p>
