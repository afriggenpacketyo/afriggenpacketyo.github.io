          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace to sign England defender Marc Guehi, pending final clearance. The 25-year-old is set to become Liverpool's second major deadline-day signing after the club also secured striker Alexander Isak in a separate deal. The transfer, part of a record-breaking summer spending spree for the club totaling over £450 million, aims to bolster a defense that has appeared vulnerable early in the season. However, Crystal Palace has not yet formally sanctioned the transfer as they struggle to find a replacement.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned the U.S. team against expecting the same strategy used in their 2023 victory in Rome, despite naming a nearly identical team for the upcoming event at Bethpage. Donald's six wildcard picks were all members of the previous winning squad, creating a historic level of continuity with 11 of the 12 players returning. However, Donald emphasized that playing in the U.S. presents a "different challenge" that will require new pairings and tactics. He also urged his players to embrace the expected raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Monday, led by a surge in the aerospace and defense sector. The rally was sparked by the announcement of a £10 billion deal for Norway to purchase British-made Type 26 frigates, marking the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export agreement by value. Shares of BAE Systems, the manufacturer, rose significantly. In other market news, pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's stock also climbed after releasing new trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective than rivals in reducing heart disease risk, highlighting investor focus on the competitive pharmaceutical space.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has publicly supported his deputy, Angela Rayner, who is facing criticism from the Conservative party over her past property dealings. The controversy centers on whether she correctly paid stamp duty on a flat in Hove, with Tories accusing her of hypocrisy and calling for an investigation. Starmer dismissed the criticism as attempts to "talk her down," describing Rayner as a "great story of British success" from a humble background. A spokesperson for Rayner has maintained that she paid all relevant taxes on the property "entirely properly."</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Activities Caused Wild Animals to Shrink and Domesticated Ones to Grow</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals a significant divergence in the body size of wild and domestic animals starting in the Middle Ages, driven by human activity. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from the past 8,000 years in southern France. They found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like foxes and deer became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding, illustrating humanity's profound and lasting impact on the natural world.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a significant bilateral meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in China, reinforcing their countries' ties. The meeting comes as India faces steep new tariffs from the U.S. in retaliation for its continued purchase of discounted Russian oil. Modi called the partnership with Russia "special and privileged," while Putin hailed the friendly and trusting relationship. This display of camaraderie between India, Russia, and China at the summit is viewed by analysts as a strategic alignment to counter economic pressure from Washington.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 12:24:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the publicly-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, making travel during traditional commuter hours significantly cheaper. The move, intended to boost passenger numbers post-pandemic, has raised questions about whether the rest of the UK could implement a similar policy. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided on the potential consequences, with some warning of overcrowded trains on popular routes and others suggesting that overall ticket prices might have to rise to compensate for the lost revenue. The UK government has stated it is looking to reform the current "confusing" fare system as it nationalizes more rail services.</p>

          <p>Rome Ramirez, who for 15 years served as the frontman for the band Sublime with Rome, is launching a solo career with a new EP titled "Gemini." After stepping into the role of the late Bradley Nowell in 2009, Ramirez toured globally but found the position eventually felt more like a job. The pandemic provided a break and an opportunity to write personal music, leading to his decision to leave the band and forge his own path. His new sound blends the West Coast reggae and hip-hop influences of his past with a new focus on soul music, reflecting his journey from a teenage fan to a solo artist.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," showcases the unique democratic structure and artistic excellence of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB). Founded by music students in 1980, the orchestra operates with a grassroots approach where all musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions, from selecting conductors to choosing repertoire. The film follows the orchestra, led by conductor Paavo Järvi, as they tackle Joseph Haydn's London Symphonies, drawing a parallel between the composer's liberation as a freelance artist and the orchestra's own independent spirit. The DKB is presented as a successful model for combining artistic virtuosity with democratic principles.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has reached an improved agreement with Bayern Munich for the transfer of striker Nicolas Jackson. The deal is structured as an initial £14.3 million loan with a mandatory purchase obligation of £56.2 million, triggered by a minimum number of appearances, bringing the total value over £70 million. The 24-year-old Senegal forward, who joined Chelsea in 2023, is reported to have lost the trust of manager Enzo Maresca after receiving two red cards last season. To fill the gap in their attack, Chelsea has signed Argentine Facundo Buonanotte from Brighton on a season-long loan.</p>
