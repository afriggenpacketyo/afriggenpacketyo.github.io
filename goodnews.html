          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks experienced a surge after announcing a A$14 billion merger. The merged entity will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies and is projected to hold A$13.1 billion in real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to unwind a 56-year mutual ownership structure intended to prevent hostile takeovers, but which critics argued suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian steel producer BlueScope Steel experienced a significant jump after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans to double tariffs on imported steel. The proposed tariffs could potentially enhance steel prices in the U.S., benefiting BlueScope, which operates five businesses in North America. However, uncertainty regarding demand from China and fluctuating iron ore prices have previously weighed on the company's stock. North America accounted for 42% of BlueScope's underlying earnings in the six months leading up to December 31, 2024.</p>
