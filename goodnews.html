        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. investors are increasingly acquiring ownership stakes in Europe's top soccer clubs, driven by a 750% surge in league revenues over the past three decades. Four of England's "Big Six" Premier League teams now have American investment, with club valuations reaching unprecedented highs, such as Manchester United's recent £5 billion valuation. This trend is fueled by high wealth aggregation in the U.S. and the relative affordability of European teams compared to major American sports franchises. The rise of multi-club ownership models, however, is attracting regulatory scrutiny from soccer governing bodies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese animated film 'Nobody' has achieved a major box office milestone, surpassing Japanese hits like 'Suzume' to become the highest-grossing 2D animated movie in China's history. The film, which is based on a 2023 online series, has earned over 1 billion yuan and is being celebrated for its unique aesthetic that incorporates traditional ink-wash painting techniques. Its success marks a significant moment for China's domestic animation industry, breaking the long-standing box office dominance of Japanese anime films in the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent consumer research reveals a 6% decline in customer traffic at casual and fast-food restaurants over the summer compared to the previous year. This shift is attributed to persistently high grocery prices, which are influencing broader spending habits. While dining out less, shoppers are not necessarily trading down at the supermarket, with sales of branded grocery items growing faster than own-label alternatives. The data suggests consumers are opting for smaller, in-home treats, like brand-name coffee or snacks, as a more affordable substitute for restaurant meals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A four-day strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has ended after their union, CUPE, reached a tentative agreement with the airline. The walkout, which began Saturday, had disrupted travel for an estimated 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The strike had been declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, but the union had initially defied the back-to-work order. The dispute centered on issues of pay and compensation for work performed while planes are on the ground.</p>

          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are combating the dual climate threats of intense rainfall and prolonged drought by restoring natural wetlands. For centuries, human engineering reclaimed land from rivers for agriculture, but this increased flood risks by removing natural buffers. Now, projects are underway to "depolder" areas, giving rivers more space and creating flood zones that can absorb excess water during storms and release it slowly during dry periods. This nature-based solution, part of a broader regional strategy, aims to make the densely populated area more resilient to extreme weather.</p>

          <p>In an effort to reverse declining sales, Best Buy has launched an online third-party marketplace on its website and app. The platform will allow other vendors to sell products directly to Best Buy's customers, expanding the retailer's assortment to include more accessories, complementary items like furniture, and niche tech products. This move follows a trend set by other major retailers and creates a new revenue stream through commissions on sales. It also supports the company's advertising business, as sellers can pay for better placement, a strategy that is particularly important in the current sluggish consumer electronics market.

          <p>Actress Michelle Williams, nominated for an Emmy for her role in the FX series "Dying for Sex," reflects on what drew her to the project. The series is based on a true story of a woman with terminal cancer who explores her sexuality while leaning on the support of her best friend. Williams was moved by the show's depiction of a passionate, platonic love story between two women, which she feels mirrors the importance of her own female friendships. She also appreciated the script's ability to blend humor and absurdity with the profound themes of grief, trauma, and the pursuit of pleasure.</p>

          <p>Cinematographer Jacques Jouffret explains that the visual approach for the series "American Primeval" was designed to reflect the harsh, sparse environment of 1857 Utah. To connect the audience with the characters' struggle for survival, the crew used a straightforward, often handheld camera style without extensive equipment. Jouffret aimed to find beauty within the frame naturally rather than constructing beautiful shots, using wide and close perspectives to convey information. The frequent use of Dutch angles was a deliberate choice to reinforce the unsettling, "shaky ground" of the American frontier, where violence and uncertainty were constant.</p>

The relocation of the landmark church is the most symbolic part of a wider project to move the city's center to safer ground.
