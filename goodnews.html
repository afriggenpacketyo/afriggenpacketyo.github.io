          <p>The state banquet held at Windsor Castle for President Donald Trump's U.K. visit featured a guest list heavy on political figures and technology executives, with a notable absence of entertainment celebrities. Key attendees included Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and media executive Rupert Murdoch, seated among prominent British politicians like Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves. The event, a key element of diplomatic hospitality, placed President Trump between King Charles and Catherine, the Princess of Wales, at the grand dining table in St George's Hall.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan proposal, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is advancing in Congress with the aim of providing financial institutions more tools to protect seniors and vulnerable adults from abuse. The legislation would allow firms like mutual funds to delay transactions if they suspect financial exploitation, which costs older Americans an estimated $28.3 billion annually. With versions of the bill moving through both the House and Senate, lawmakers are seeking to create stronger safeguards against theft, which is most often perpetrated by someone known to the victim.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling nearly 164,000 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue where door trim pieces can detach while driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the detached trim could create a road hazard and increase the risk of a crash for other vehicles. The issue is attributed to a vehicle assembly problem rather than a parts defect, and the company has stated it is not aware of any related accidents or injuries. Dealers will inspect and replace the trim free of charge.</p>

          <h2>WTO Director-General Sees Opportunity for 'Reglobalisation' Amid Trump's Trade Policies</h2>

          <p>World Trade Organization Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala offered a surprisingly optimistic perspective on the trade disruptions caused by President Donald Trump's unilateral tariffs. She framed the challenges as a unique opportunity to rebalance supply chains, open new markets, and foster a new era of "reglobalisation." Speaking at a WTO forum, Okonjo-Iweala pushed back against claims that the organization is irrelevant, arguing that despite trade battles, the majority of global commerce still operates under its rules. She suggested the current climate is a chance to approach global trade differently.</p>

          <p>With Bitcoin's value nearly doubling over the past year and new investment vehicles becoming available, more Americans are considering adding cryptocurrency to their retirement accounts. Financial experts remain divided on the strategy, with some emphasizing the inherent volatility and risk, while others see potential for high returns if managed carefully. Advisors who support the inclusion of crypto recommend it only for investors with a high risk tolerance and suggest limiting allocations to a small portion of the overall portfolio, typically between 5% and 15%.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years, sparking a surge in loan and refinancing applications. This significant decline is largely driven by the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate cut and a corresponding dip in 10-year Treasury yields. For prospective homebuyers who were sidelined by higher borrowing costs, this new rate environment presents a valuable opportunity. Experts advise buyers to get preapproved quickly and compare lenders to lock in the best possible rate before the market potentially shifts again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, financial experts are advising savers to consider opening long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to lock in currently available rates. With the possibility of further rate reductions in October and December, a long-term CD can protect savings from the declining yields expected for other accounts like high-yield savings. Even with the recent cut, rates on 3-year and 5-year CDs can still provide significant, guaranteed returns, offering a stable investment option in an unpredictable economic climate.

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume a daily amount of alcohol equivalent to nearly two human cocktails by eating naturally fermented figs and plums. Scientists measured the ethanol content in the fruits and calculated the primates' intake, which results in a steady, low-dose exposure rather than intoxication. The findings lend support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors, who were drawn to the scent of ethanol as a sign of ripe, calorie-rich food.</p>
