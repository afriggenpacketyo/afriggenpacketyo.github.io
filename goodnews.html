          <p>This week's "CBS Sunday Morning" features a segment remembering Julie Moore, an Army spouse who spearheaded changes to military protocol for notifying families of service member deaths. Moore's efforts led to service members delivering the news in person with additional support, a significant shift from the impersonal telegrams used previously. The broadcast also includes segments on journalist Steve Rosenberg's reporting from Russia, a food-as-art feature, and an interview with novelist Anne Tyler. Other segments cover Delta Air Lines' 100th anniversary and the cartoon art of Barbara Shermund.</p>

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region, leading to a noticeable decrease in Israeli airstrikes on Syria. Previously, Israel had conducted numerous attacks to prevent weapons from falling into hostile hands. However, Trump's recent meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have shifted the dynamic. This has raised concerns among Israeli officials about the potential rise of another anti-Israel neighbor.</p>

          <p>Hikers in the Czech Republic's Krkono≈°e Mountains discovered a mysterious stash of gold bracelets, cigar cases, a powder compact, and hundreds of coins hidden in an aluminum box. The items, none of which are of local origin, are being studied by experts at the Museum of Eastern Bohemia. Hypotheses range from connections to pre-World War II departures of Czech and Jewish populations to the post-war German exodus in 1945. The most recent coin is dated 1921, adding to the enigma surrounding the find.</p>
