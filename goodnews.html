          <p>Uber has entered a six-year partnership with electric vehicle maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup Nuro to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis. As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid, whose stock surged 37% following the news. Nuro will provide the Level 4 self-driving technology, enabling the vehicles to operate without a human driver under normal conditions. The collaboration aims to launch a robotaxi service in a major U.S. city next year, marking a significant step in making autonomous ride-hailing a widespread reality and expanding Lucid into a new market.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, following an evaluation for mild leg swelling. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that comprehensive vascular studies ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. This official disclosure came after public speculation arose from photographs showing the president with swollen ankles and bruised hands. The bruising was attributed to frequent handshaking combined with aspirin use as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen, with officials affirming the president remains in excellent overall health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned six key members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its leader Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, also known as 'Niño Guerrero.' These sanctions are part of a broader U.S. effort to dismantle the criminal organization, which President Trump recently designated a foreign terrorist group. The gang, which originated in a Venezuelan prison, is implicated in a wide range of violent crimes across the Western Hemisphere, including murder, human trafficking, sexual assault, and kidnapping. The sanctions block all U.S.-based assets and transactions involving the designated individuals, aiming to disrupt the group's destabilizing influence.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved Yulia Svyrydenko as the new prime minister, replacing Denys Shmyhal in a significant government reshuffle during the ongoing war with Russia. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated the changes are necessary to implement agreements with international partners. Svyrydenko, 39, the former economy minister, is seen as a tough negotiator and a confidante of the president. While the opposition has raised questions about the legitimacy of a reshuffle under martial law, analysts suggest the move is intended to address management issues and inject new credibility into the government without fundamentally altering its policy direction.</p>

          <p>Resident doctors in the UK have engaged in 'constructive discussions' with Health Secretary Wes Streeting in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike over pay. While the government maintains it cannot increase its 5.4% pay offer, it is reportedly exploring other 'creative solutions' to improve doctors' working conditions. The British Medical Association (BMA) argues that doctors' pay has been eroded by inflation over the past 17 years and the current offer is insufficient. Both sides have agreed to continue talks, creating a 'window of opportunity' to find a resolution and avoid further disruption to the NHS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, with some Republican support, is reintroducing legislation to classify extreme heat as a major disaster under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for heat-related emergencies, such as providing cooling centers, air conditioning, and water infrastructure. The proposal follows a record-breaking heat dome in June that affected nearly half the country but was not eligible for a disaster declaration. While proponents argue this is crucial for public health, some, including a former FEMA administrator, believe existing hazard mitigation grants can already address these needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move ministers say will strengthen democracy by engaging young people. Critics, however, suggest the change is politically motivated to benefit the Labour Party, which polls show is more popular among younger demographics. While polls indicate a left-leaning tendency in young voters, experts note that 16 and 17-year-olds represent a small fraction of the electorate, and their impact could be negligible, especially given historically lower turnout in younger age groups. The political landscape is also fracturing, with other parties potentially appealing to this new group of voters.</p>

          <p>A new book by New York Times correspondent Michael Grynbaum, titled 'Empire of the Elite,' examines the rise and fall of Condé Nast, the media dynasty that once dictated American taste through magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker. The book details how the company, known for its lavish spending and authoritative voice, struggled to adapt to the digital age and the rise of social media influencers. It explores how editors like Anna Wintour and Tina Brown shaped culture by blending high and low, but ultimately, the company's insular, top-down model failed to keep pace with a decentralized media landscape.</p>

          <p>An Idaho judge has lifted the comprehensive gag order in the Bryan Kohberger quadruple murder case, a decision that follows Kohberger's guilty plea to the 2022 stabbing deaths of four university students. A coalition of news organizations had argued for the order to be lifted, and the judge agreed that with no trial planned, the public's First Amendment rights were paramount. The defense had expressed concerns about fueling publicity ahead of sentencing on July 23. The judge denied a separate motion to unseal case documents for now but plans to review them for potential release after sentencing.</p>

          <p>The six largest U.S. banks reported combined profits of approximately $39 billion for the second quarter, significantly exceeding analyst expectations and signaling considerable economic strength. This robust performance was driven by a boom in stock and bond trading, a pickup in corporate mergers, and continued strong consumer spending and borrowing, despite initial market fears over new tariff policies. Bank executives noted that the corporate community has adapted to the uncertainty, contributing to a surprisingly profitable environment. The results suggest both Wall Street and Main Street are demonstrating resilience in the current economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's announcement about Coca-Cola potentially switching to cane sugar, health experts have weighed in on whether it is healthier than high-fructose corn syrup. While there are minor chemical differences, experts state that both sweeteners have similar negative health impacts when consumed in excess, contributing to conditions like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Both are considered empty calories and have a high glycemic index. Some experts express concern over the higher fructose content in corn syrup and its potential link to inflammation, but the general consensus is that limiting intake of all added sugars is key for good health.</p>
