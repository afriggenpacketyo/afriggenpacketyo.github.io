          <p>Former President Joe Biden spoke at a Memorial Day event in Delaware, marking his first public remarks since announcing his diagnosis of an aggressive form of prostate cancer. During the event, Biden remembered his son, Beau Biden, who passed away 10 years prior after battling brain cancer. Biden shared that being with the attendees made the difficult day a little easier and acknowledged the pain of grief, reminding those present that they are not alone in their experiences. Biden's office previously disclosed his cancer diagnosis, noting a Gleason score of 9, the most severe category, and that he was never previously diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p>

          <p>A paraglider in China survived an accidental ascent to 28,208 feet without oxygen after being caught in a powerful updraft, according to Chinese Central Television (CCTV). Peng Yujiang, an experienced paraglider, was conducting a routine equipment test when he became trapped inside a cumulonimbus cloud system, experiencing a phenomenon known as "cloud suck." Footage from the flight shows Peng flying through thick clouds as ice formed around his face and equipment, and he was later handed a six-month flight suspension because the flight site and airspace had not been approved in advance. Despite the terrifying experience, Peng survived, though he expressed reluctance to fly again in the near future.</p>

          <p>British universities are preparing to attract international Chinese students following the Trump administration's tightened visa policies for Chinese students in the U.S. The U.S. plans to revoke visas for Chinese students with ties to the Chinese Communist Party and has blocked Harvard University's ability to enroll or retain international students. U.K. universities are poised to capitalize on this shift, offering shorter degree durations, affordable living costs, and globally recognized qualifications to prospective students.

The findings contradict claims made in a recent report led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who advocates for ending water fluoridation.</p>
