          <h2>Fortnite Resubmitted to Apple App Store Following Court Ruling</h2>

          <p>Epic Games has resubmitted Fortnite to Apple's App Store after a judge ruled in their favor regarding link-outs and commissions. This follows Fortnite's removal from the App Store in 2020 due to Epic Games bypassing Apple's payment system. The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple still has the option to reject the submission and is appealing the ruling, but developers like Amazon and Spotify have already updated their apps to avoid Apple's commissions. The game has been available in Europe through Epic Games' store due to the Digital Markets Act.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an alternative to Pap smears. The test, developed by Teal Health, involves vaginal swabbing and mail-in HPV testing. This approval stems from the understanding that HPV causes almost all cervical cancer cases. The at-home test is considered as accurate as Pap smears and aims to improve screening rates, particularly for women who face barriers to in-person appointments. If the test is positive, a follow-up appointment is required.</p>

          <p>Randy Carr, CEO of World Emblem, faces challenges due to on-again-off-again tariffs. His company, which produces embroidered patches, initially saw an opportunity when tariffs were imposed on competitors in China. However, the benefits were short-lived as tariffs on raw materials and potential economic recession threatened the company's success. Carr also faces rising labor costs in Mexico, leading him to consider opening a factory in the Dominican Republic.

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, stating that her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens. Ozturk was detained by ICE agents after co-authoring an essay critical of Israel. The judge found no evidence that Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests and cited First Amendment concerns. Ozturk, who suffers from chronic asthma, testified about the poor conditions at the detention center. The judge's decision marks another defeat for the government's efforts to deport international students involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to unveil a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices. The administration previously sought to implement this idea, tying prices to the lowest prices in other countries, but it was blocked by court orders during Trump's first term. The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for the blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, to be released from immigration custody on bail. The judge cited concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was detained after her student visa was revoked. Ozturk's lawyers argued that she was detained for her role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia. The Trump administration claimed that she made antisemitic statements and threatening rhetoric, which Ozturk denied.</p>
