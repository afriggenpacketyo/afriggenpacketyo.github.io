          <p>China has tested core components of quantum communication technology in a space flight, marking a step toward building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were launched on a rocket to test their robustness against the stresses of space travel. This test is part of China's effort to transition from experimental validation to a fully integrated quantum secure direct communication network. Quantum secure direct communication is considered a highly secure method of transmitting messages without encryption keys.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) is warning residents about a fake online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The deceptive ad, circulating on social media, asks for personal information and payment through unofficial channels like Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never requests personal information or payment through social media or transaction applications. Residents are advised to renew their vehicle registration directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by making an appointment at a DMV office.</p>
