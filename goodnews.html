          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it will slow the pace of government bond purchases from April of next year, maintaining its benchmark rate at 0.5% amid rising growth risks. The BOJ plans to reduce its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by about 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, aiming for about 3 trillion yen monthly. Starting April 2026, the cuts will slow to 200 billion yen per quarter until March 2027, targeting a monthly purchase amount of about 2 trillion yen. This adjustment aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets and support market stability, with another assessment scheduled for June 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan, traditionally known for its pacifist constitution, is increasingly focusing on the global arms exports market, driven by security concerns rather than solely for profit. The primary motivation is to deepen ties and improve interoperability with allies and partners, achieved through standardized maintenance and joint training. Exporting arms will also help develop Japan's defense industrial base, which has suffered from limited domestic demand and reliance on U.S. weapons purchases. Veteran investor David Roche suggests that a more transactional approach from the U.S. necessitates Japan to invest more in its own defense.</p>
