          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has abandoned a proposed rule that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, faced strong opposition from airlines who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider extra-statutory requirements while still implementing consumer protections mandated by Congress, such as ticket refunds. Airline industry groups praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from overly burdensome regulations.</p>

          <p>Joseph McNeil, one of the four Black college students who initiated the landmark 1960 Greensboro lunch counter sit-ins, has passed away at the age of 83. McNeil, along with his three classmates from North Carolina A&T State University, sparked a wave of nonviolent civil rights protests across the South by refusing to leave a "whites only" Woolworth's counter. Their courageous act led to the desegregation of the Greensboro counter within six months and inspired the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. McNeil later served in the Air Force, retiring as a two-star major general.</p>

          <p>Bryan Hooper Sr. has been released from a Minnesota prison after his murder conviction was vacated, having spent nearly 27 years incarcerated for a crime he did not commit. His 1998 conviction was based largely on the testimony of a woman who has since confessed to the murder. The Hennepin County Attorney's office supported Hooper's release after this key witness recanted her testimony, and jailhouse informants had also previously recanted. The case highlights the profound and lasting damage of wrongful convictions and the crucial work of innocence projects in seeking justice.</p>

The confirmation came after Biden was seen with a bandage on his head in Delaware. This is not his first encounter with skin cancer; in 2023, a basal cell carcinoma lesion was removed from his chest, and he has had several non-melanoma skin cancers removed previously. The news follows a May announcement that the former president was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, has suggested that enterprises are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. In an interview, Arora explained that while these autonomous AI agents—which can perform tasks like booking flights—are appealing to consumers, they pose a significant security risk to businesses. He argued that because these agents require user credentials to operate, their autonomy is "at odds with the enterprise," which must protect its most sensitive data. Arora predicted that without built-in security oriented around credentials, such browsers would not be permitted in corporate environments.</p>

          <p>New York City has opened a unique high school, the HBCU Early College Prep, designed to create a direct pipeline for students to Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Located in Queens, the school is the first of its kind in a major U.S. city and aims to increase exposure to HBCUs, which are predominantly located in the South. Students at the new school can earn up to 64 college credits for an associate's degree from Delaware State University (DSU) and are guaranteed admission there upon graduation. The initiative is seen as a way to bolster the role HBCUs play in building the Black middle class.</p>

Taccone shattered his pelvis and detached his sacrum after falling 20 feet from a ladder at his Connecticut farmhouse while trying to hang lights for a mural. Recounting the incident on a podcast, he said he had enough time while falling to think he was going to die. Doctors expect him to be able to walk again within three to six months, and his podcast co-hosts expressed their relief that his injuries were not fatal.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released a new memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which offers a raw and unflinching look at her relationship with her formidable mother, Mary Roy. The article describes Mary Roy as a complex figure: a feminist icon and educator who also could be a bully, creating a bond with her daughter that was both a "shelter and a storm." The memoir is not a hagiography but a deeply personal account of a turbulent, often brutal, yet ultimately life-affirming relationship. Roy reflects on how this intense upbringing shaped her as a writer, calling the book a "reportage of the heart."</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was based on financial logic and "mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the high salary commitment to one player could instead be used to pay for several top-tier players, which also mitigates the risk of injury to a single star. He emphasized the move was not personal and was about maximizing the number of high-quality players on the field.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is considering a new measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased deaths and hospitalizations, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. The measure faces opposition from landlord associations, who warn it will drive up housing costs.</p>

While maintaining a relatively private profile, she has been instrumental in initiatives like the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, and a new task force on AI in education. This approach builds on her first-term "Be Best" campaign but takes a more business- and legislative-oriented tack.

          <p>With home equity at record highs and an anticipated interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve, this article advises homeowners to ask critical questions before borrowing. Homeowners should first determine exactly how much equity they can access and assess if their financial needs are truly urgent enough to warrant a loan at current rates. It also suggests weighing the benefits of borrowing now versus waiting for potentially lower rates later in the year, while acknowledging that loans can be refinanced.

Over 99% of these stablecoins are backed by the U.S. dollar, which far exceeds the greenback's share of traditional global payments and reserves. This dominance effectively extends U.S. financial influence into the digital currency space, a trend that could undermine China's efforts to promote the yuan and reduce its reliance on the dollar.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure at Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the club's ownership made the decision, believing a change in leadership would lead to greater on-field success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and transformed the club into a financially profitable entity, but he also faced consistent criticism from fans over a lack of trophies. The departure marks the end of an era for the club, which is now looking toward a new leadership structure.</p>
