        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index reveals that national home prices rose by only 2.7% in April compared to the previous year, marking the smallest gain in nearly two years. This deceleration is attributed to rising housing supply and slowing demand, with some previously hot markets like Tampa and Dallas experiencing price declines. Higher mortgage rates are pricing out potential buyers, particularly first-timers, contributing to the weakening market. While prices are weakening, they are not at risk of major declines due to constrained housing supply, as existing homeowners are reluctant to surrender their sub-4% pandemic-era rates, and new construction is failing to meet demand.

          <p>NATO leaders are convening to discuss increasing defense spending, but nearly a third of the alliance's members have not met the existing target of 2% of GDP. The new target is set to be 5% of GDP on core defense and related areas, with President Trump criticizing low-spending nations like Spain. While the 2% target is not legally binding, political pressure is being applied to encourage increased spending, and most members have increased their spending since 2014. Spain, the lowest spender, aims to reach 2.1% by the end of the year, while Canada, Belgium, Portugal and Italy have also pledged to meet the target soon.
