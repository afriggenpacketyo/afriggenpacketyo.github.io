        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newspapers across the UK are covering Prime Minister Keir Starmer's new trade deal with the EU, which aims to secure cheaper food and energy. The Times highlights the deal's promise to boost the economy by ¬£9 billion a year, while critics label it a "sell-out on fishing rights." The Guardian emphasizes the PM's claim that the deal puts Britain back on the world stage, granting unprecedented access to the EU market, but also notes Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch's concerns about concessions on youth visas and fishing. The papers also cover Britain, France, and Canada's warning to Netanyahu regarding Gaza.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the growing electric vehicle market. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to allocate 90% of the raised funds to construct its factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients, including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a revenue drop in 2024 due to intense competition, the company's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union and the United States, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners. However, these deals required concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished position post-Brexit. The agreement with the EU will generate nearly 9 billion pounds annually by 2040, but will add only 0.2 percent to Britain's GDP, while Brexit cost the country 5.5 percent of its GDP. To secure these deals, Britain made concessions on fishing rights and access to American agricultural products.</p>

Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while still being available on PBS. Earlier this month, President Trump issued an executive order to block federal funding for PBS and radio network NPR, alleging they engaged in "biased and partisan news coverage." Netflix has been increasing its focus on children's content, which accounts for 15% of viewing on its service.</p>

          <p>China cut its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction in rates since October. The People's Bank of China trimmed the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. The rate cuts came as a slew of state-backed commercial lenders moved to reduce their deposit rates by as much as 25 basis points earlier Tuesday in an effort to protect their net interest margin, paving the way to lower key lending rates. The bundle of rate cuts came as part of a package of stimulus measures announced by Beijing earlier this month. (not investment advice)</p>

The self-imposed guardrails of the government limited its room for maneuver in post-Brexit negotiations. The Prime Minister claimed the deal has dramatically improved trading ties with the EU, but some Brexiteers say it has crossed a crucial rubicon: the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" in some areas. The government calls it a "reset" but in reality resetting, in one direction or another, is probably permanent or semi-permanent.</p>
