          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the military flight team responsible for the recent strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities will be honored at the White House on Independence Day. Speaking at a rally, Trump praised the pilots and crew for their precision, stating they executed one of the greatest military maneuvers in U.S. history and that their actions resulted in the complete obliteration of the targets. He criticized early media reports that downplayed the mission's success, viewing it as an insult to the military personnel involved. The entire flight crew, including mechanics, will be celebrated for their efforts.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of a devastating wildfire in Los Angeles's Pacific Palisades, a non-profit initiative called Project Chimney is working to save the last remnants of architecturally significant homes: their chimneys. Led by artist Evan Hall, the group is salvaging these structures, designed by modernists like Richard Neutra, from the charred ruins before cleanup crews demolish them. The goal is to use the salvaged chimneys to create a community memorial, preserving the memory of the homes and the history lost in the fire. The project faces significant logistical and financial challenges under a tight deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers.</p>

          <p>China's national medical products regulator has officially unveiled its support for the development and medical application of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The agency plans to strengthen research and standardization for related biomedical materials, such as flexible electrodes, and promote new evaluation methods for the safety and efficacy of BCI-based medical devices. This initiative aims to accelerate the use of BCI to help individuals with impairments from conditions like stroke, spinal cord injuries, and ALS. The technology holds promise for restoring motor functions, sight, and hearing for affected patients.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to hydration multipliers, but medical experts advise caution and emphasize that plain water remains the best option for general hydration. These powdered supplements can be beneficial for replenishing electrolytes lost through heavy sweating, particularly during strenuous exercise lasting over an hour. However, doctors warn consumers to check product labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. They stress that these products are supplements, not replacements for water, and recommend consulting a doctor before use.</p>

The Pike, which operated from 1902 to 1979, developed a reputation as a gritty, sometimes unsavory destination for sailors and thrill-seekers but endured for decades. In contrast, POP, which opened in 1958 as a clean-cut, futuristic competitor to Disneyland, lasted less than ten years due to high maintenance costs and competition. The article reflects on their different fates and the legacy of L.A.'s bygone beachfront entertainment.</p>

          <p>As concerns about the stability of U.S. democracy grow, this article revisits the intellectual arguments in its defense, particularly the concept of 'value pluralism' championed by philosopher Isaiah Berlin. Berlin argued against 'monism'—the belief in a single, perfect societal vision—by asserting that human values are diverse, often incompatible, and cannot be perfectly harmonized. This inherent tension means trade-offs are necessary, making freedom of choice essential. The article suggests that remembering this defense is crucial for upholding a liberal democracy that respects differing perspectives and guards against the dangers of totalitarian thinking, which promises an unattainable utopia.</p>

Felize describes the extra planning required for a night out and the challenges of navigating spaces not designed for wheelchairs, as well as the uninformed behavior of other club-goers.

Its success is attributed to SpaceX's reusable rocket technology, which dramatically lowers launch costs, and its first-mover advantage in building a massive satellite constellation.

          <p>A new short film, 'Final Finishers,' shifts the focus of the New York City Marathon from elite winners to the amateur runners who cross the finish line long after dark. The film highlights the extraordinary and relatable stories of those at the back of the pack, who often face immense personal challenges to complete the 26.2-mile race. By celebrating these everyday heroes, the film aims to inspire a broader audience who may not see themselves in professional athletes. It argues that the most compelling stories of perseverance and triumph are not always found at the front of the race.</p>
