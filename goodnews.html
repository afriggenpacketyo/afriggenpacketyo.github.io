          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated the Boston Red Sox's eight-game winning streak, attributing their success to a recent visit to the White House. In a post on Truth Social, Trump noted, "They haven’t lost since they saw me in the Oval." The impromptu visit occurred on July 3 while the team was in Washington, D.C., for a series. The article also revisits manager Alex Cora's past decision to skip a White House visit in 2019 to protest the federal government's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Orange Order members and spectators gathered across Northern Ireland for the annual Twelfth of July parades, commemorating the 1690 Battle of the Boyne. The events, which celebrate Protestant traditions and Ulster-Scots heritage, took place in 18 locations including Belfast, Coleraine, and Keady. Officials and participants described the day as peaceful and celebratory, with large crowds and sunny weather contributing to a positive atmosphere. The article notes the event passed largely without issue, even at historically sensitive locations like Ardoyne in north Belfast.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his best pitching performance of the season, helping the Los Angeles Dodgers snap a seven-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants. Pitching three scoreless innings, Ohtani struck out four batters and allowed only one hit, setting a positive tone for the team. While still on a limited workload following Tommy John surgery, his contribution was pivotal before bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan took over to secure the win. Ohtani's effective return to the mound provides a much-needed boost for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing the need for marriage and children, some experts argue this may not be a negative development. The article profiles a young professional who prefers a single life, believing AI will eventually fulfill needs for companionship and elderly care, traditionally provided by family. A leading demographer suggests the AI revolution could redefine fundamental concepts of life, family, and social structures, potentially making traditional population concerns obsolete. This technological shift could lead to new ways of addressing societal needs.</p>

          <p>Tensions flared between England and India at the end of day three of the third Test at Lord's over accusations of time-wasting. England opener Zak Crawley used various delays to ensure he and his partner only had to face one over before the close of play, instead of a potential two. The Indian team, including captain Shubman Gill, reacted angrily to the tactics. However, England's bowling coach Tim Southee defended the move, pointing out that India had employed similar time-wasting strategies earlier in the match, suggesting it is part of the game.</p>
