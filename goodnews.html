          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, about the potential impact on contraception. The MHRA advises that these medications may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese women, due to common side effects like vomiting and diarrhea. Additionally, the agency cautions that the effects of these medicines on unborn babies are unknown, advising women to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Brydon Carse considered having his toe amputated to address an injury sustained from the impact of his front foot hitting the crease while bowling. Ultimately, he opted for rest, a change to narrower boots, new insoles, and a modified hole in his footwear. Carse, who made his Test debut in Pakistan last October, is viewed as a key player for England. Despite the toe problems, he played in all three of the recent one-day internationals against West Indies and was included in England's squad for the first Test against India.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns.

CDs are generally safe investments, with FDIC or NCUA insurance covering balances up to $250,000. Current national averages for CD yields vary by term, with short-term CDs often offering the best rates due to the inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>
