          <p>Three exceptionally fragile, 1,200-year-old Viking ships are being moved to a new, state-of-the-art museum in Oslo, Norway, in a highly delicate operation described as their final voyage. The first vessel, the Oseberg, is being transported over a hundred yards using a custom-built steel rig and an overhead crane system, a process requiring extreme precision to avoid damaging the ancient oak. Curators have emphasized the immense risk, stating that any slight deformation could cause the hulls to crack, making this a nerve-wracking but essential effort to preserve the national treasures for another century.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the street artist Banksy, which appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London, is being removed by authorities. The artwork depicted a judge with a gavel looming over a fallen protester and was interpreted as a commentary on recent arrests. Banksy confirmed his responsibility for the piece on Instagram. The HM Courts & Tribunals Service stated that the removal was legally necessary because the building is a listed structure, which legally protects its character from alterations.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgages in the United States has reached its highest point in three years, driven by a significant drop in interest rates that has encouraged both homebuyers and existing homeowners to act. Total mortgage application volume increased by 9.2% last week, with refinancing applications jumping 12% as borrowers sought to secure lower monthly payments. The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.49%, its lowest level since October 2024, providing a much-needed stimulus to the housing market after a period of slower activity.

          <p>For 57 years, scientists at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire have been meticulously mapping the territories of songbirds, creating one of the longest-running datasets of its kind. This extensive research, which began with hand-drawn maps and is now digitized, tracks how bird populations respond to the forest's natural aging process. The data has shown how certain species, like the American redstart, have moved on as the habitat changed, offering a crucial window into long-term ecological shifts and the overall health of the forest ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price surged over 28% in after-hours trading, not because of its current earnings, but due to its extraordinary forecast for future growth in its cloud infrastructure business. The company projected its cloud revenue will jump from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year and eventually reach $144 billion, driven by massive AI-related contracts, including one with OpenAI. Analysts on the earnings call expressed shock and amazement at the numbers, which signal a seismic shift in the cloud computing landscape and position Oracle as a major competitor to Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

          <h2>Uber to Integrate Helicopter Rides into App Through Partnership with Joby Aviation</h2>

          <p>Uber is set to expand its transportation offerings into the sky by launching Blade helicopter rides directly through its app, with a target launch date as early as 2026. This new service is an extension of its partnership with Joby Aviation, an electric air taxi manufacturer that recently acquired Blade. The move represents a significant step in Uber's long-held ambition to integrate air travel into its platform, aiming to provide customers with faster travel options and address urban traffic congestion. The integration will lay the groundwork for the eventual introduction of Joby's quiet, zero-emission aircraft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, allowing her to remain in her position as a lawsuit over her removal proceeds. The judge ruled that Cook showed a strong likelihood that her removal violated the Federal Reserve Act, which limits the firing of a governor to "for cause" related to their behavior in office, not for actions that occurred before their appointment. This decision marks a significant moment in the unprecedented legal battle over the independence of the central bank from political interference.</p>

          <p>Authorities in El Salvador have successfully intercepted a significant drug shipment, seizing 1.4 tons of cocaine found in packages floating in the Pacific Ocean. President Nayib Bukele announced the seizure, which took place approximately 1,000 miles off the country's coast and is valued at an estimated $35 million. The operation is part of a broader crackdown on international drug trafficking, as Central America remains a key transit route for narcotics heading to the United States. The U.S. embassy praised the successful action as a sign of growing coordination between international partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation data to be released this week is anticipated to show that prices in the U.S. accelerated in August, though economists believe it will not prevent the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates. Both the producer and consumer price indexes are expected to show monthly increases, pushing the annual headline CPI rate to 2.9%. However, policymakers are likely to focus on the stable core inflation reading and the fact that price hikes are largely driven by tariffs on goods rather than broader service sector inflation, allowing them to prioritize addressing a weakening jobs market.

          <p>Alcohol brands Strongbow and Jägermeister have withdrawn social media advertisements following rulings from the UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The watchdog found that a Strongbow ad featuring a talking can of cider irresponsibly implied that alcohol could take priority over personal responsibilities like writing wedding vows. Separately, two Jägermeister ads were banned for suggesting alcohol was a key component of social success. Both companies accepted the judgments and have since removed the posts from their platforms.</p>

Speaking at a summit in Hong Kong, he argued that the infrastructure strategy has been a significant boon for his country's economic development. He cited roads, an airport, an expressway, and a planned canal funded by China as key projects that have directly benefited the Cambodian people by accelerating regional trade and improving connectivity.</p>

While the universities state the merger will provide a strong financial foundation, the University and College Union has raised concerns about inevitable job losses.</p>
