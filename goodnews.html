          <p>The England Lionesses are embracing a new team mantra, "proper English," to drive their performance in the Euro 2025 tournament. The phrase, signifying fight, desire, and resilience, was reinforced after a disappointing opening loss to France. Players and manager Sarina Wiegman have highlighted the mantra's role in their subsequent convincing victory over the Netherlands. This identity combines traditional English tenacity with Wiegman's more dynamic, possession-based tactical approach, aiming to blend grit with modern football flair.</p>

          <p>China is set for its next space station resupply mission, with the Tianzhou-9 cargo spacecraft and its Long March-7 Y10 carrier rocket now at the Wenchang launch site. The China Manned Space Agency confirmed that all launch site facilities are in good condition and pre-launch tests are proceeding as planned. The cargo includes supplies for the astronauts, such as two sets of advanced, domestically developed spacesuits designed for extended use. The mission will also deliver new training equipment to help astronauts counteract muscle atrophy in microgravity.</p>

          <p>A recent CFA Institute survey reveals that students believe finance offers the best career prospects, yet other data indicates this perception may be misleading. While finance is popular, its graduates face higher unemployment rates than those with degrees in fields like art history or nutritional sciences. Similarly, economics majors have a higher unemployment rate than philosophy majors. The article notes a rising demand for humanities graduates, with firms like BlackRock actively seeking them for their creative thinking and soft skills, which are becoming more valuable in an AI-driven economy.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, totaling 225,000 shares, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan. This sale follows a previous $15 million sale in June under the same plan, which allows for unloading up to six million shares. Huang's net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Warren Buffett, as Nvidia's market capitalization recently surpassed $4 trillion. Despite the sales, Huang still holds over 858 million shares of the AI chipmaking giant. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" movie has become a target in the culture wars, with critics decrying it as "superwoke" for acknowledging the character's immigrant story. This article argues the backlash is misguided, pointing out that Superman has always been an immigrant, a refugee from Krypton raised in America's heartland. While the film's director, James Gunn, has noted this theme, the movie itself focuses on universal values of kindness and personal choice. The piece suggests that unlike other comic book stories, Superman's has rarely delved deeply into the politics of immigration, making the current controversy largely unfounded.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition at Descanso Gardens, titled "Roots of Cool," is bringing the issue of urban climate inequities to life. The show features all-women artists whose work explores the concept of "shade equity"—the unequal access to cooling tree canopies across different neighborhoods. Installations visualize the lack of shade at bus stops, which disproportionately affects women of color, and use data to highlight historical redlining's impact on urban heat. The exhibit aims to engage visitors emotionally and intellectually, encouraging them to envision a greener, more equitable future for Los Angeles.</p>
