          <h2>Federal Reserve Maintains Interest Rates Amid Trump Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 20:00:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold steady its benchmark interest rate, currently ranging from 4.25% to 4.5%, despite pressure from President Trump to lower borrowing costs. The central bank is carefully evaluating the potential economic impact of Trump's trade policies, especially regarding inflation and unemployment. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted rising risks but emphasized the need for a 'wait-and-see' approach given the uncertainty surrounding the economy's trajectory under the Trump administration's trade policies. Wall Street analysts interpreted Powell's statements as a sign of increasing stagflation risks, indicating a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.</p>

          <p>Another Maine school district, RSU No. 24, voted to rescind a policy allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports, joining MSAD No. 70 in amending gender eligibility policies. This decision aligns with a broader trend in the state where some residents and school districts are opposing Democratic leadership's efforts to protect transgender athletes' rights. The Department of Justice is suing Maine for not complying with Trump's 'Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports' executive order. The debate intensified after a trans athlete won multiple events at a girls' track meet, highlighting the ongoing controversy surrounding transgender athletes' participation in sports.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, an ally of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as the U.S. Surgeon General. Means, known for her advocacy of Kennedy's 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) agenda, replaces Dr. Janette Nesheiwat. Means has been vocal about addressing the root causes of chronic diseases and is the co-founder of Levels, a health app connected to glucose monitors. While Means supports Kennedy's push for vaccine safety, some of Kennedy's anti-vaccine base are skeptical of her focus on nutrition and synthetic food dyes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Binyamin Appelbaum argues that the charitable tax deduction in the U.S. distorts philanthropy, disproportionately benefiting wealthy donors and the institutions they support. He points out that those with higher incomes receive larger tax breaks for their donations, while most Americans don't receive any federal tax benefit for their charitable giving. Appelbaum suggests replacing the current system with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, not the donor's income, advocating for a system that provides equal subsidies for all donors, regardless of their income bracket.</p>

          <p>Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being in orbit for over 50 years. Launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, the spacecraft never escaped low Earth orbit and separated into pieces. Experts believe that at least part of the lander probe, built to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive re-entry. The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude.</p>
