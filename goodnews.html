        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April as demand for imports declined, following a surge related to President Trump's tariff announcements. The deficit fell to $61.6 billion, a significant decrease from the previous month's $76.7 billion, as imports decreased by 16.3% and exports increased by 3%. This shift reflects adjustments in trade patterns following the imposition of tariffs, though some economists caution against interpreting the deficit reduction as entirely positive news. While the trade imbalance with China remains the largest, ongoing trade talks suggest potential for further adjustments in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25 basis point interest rate cut and lowered its inflation expectations, citing a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the 2% ECB target rate in May, reaching 1.9%, and the ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025. This decision takes the deposit facility rate to 2%, down from a mid-2023 high of 4%. While the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%, the move comes amidst increasing uncertainty in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions and potential impacts from U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>Americans bought fewer foreign pharmaceuticals, cellphones and cars, and cut purchases of machinery and other supplies. The decrease in imports is likely due to the impact of tariffs on trade, as Americans adjust their purchasing habits in response to higher prices on imported goods. The shift in trade patterns reflects the broader economic effects of tariff policies, which can influence consumer behavior and international trade relationships. The decline in imports signals a potential slowdown in certain sectors of the economy.</p>

The decision is part of a product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over 18 months, with Kuniskis expecting Hemi to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. The move reflects a shift in automakers' plans as EV adoption has been slower than expected, and the Trump administration has sought to unwind initiatives pushing the industry away from internal combustion engines.</p>
