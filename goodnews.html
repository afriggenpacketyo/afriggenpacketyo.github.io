          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged over 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal emerged during renegotiations of a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for the company's Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium. An administration official stated that in exchange for more favorable loan repayment terms, the government requested a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. The move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the photo-sharing app Instagram has reached a major milestone of 3 billion monthly active users. This places Instagram in the same user-base tier as Meta's other flagship platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp. The last publicly disclosed figure for the platform was in October 2022, when it had surpassed 2 billion monthly users. The growth highlights the platform's continued dominance and expansion in the social media landscape, years after its $1 billion acquisition by Meta, then known as Facebook, back in 2012.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost sales of its crucial F-150 pickup truck, Ford Motor is offering special financing rates to customers with lower, subprime credit scores. The promotion extends lower interest rates, typically reserved for buyers with high credit ratings, to those with FICO scores below 620. Ford Credit stated this is an effort to improve affordability and manage inventory, asserting that it only finances customers it deems creditworthy through its proprietary scoring model. This move comes as auto loan rates remain high and F-150 sales, while up for the year, saw a decline in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel returned to the air with an emotional monologue, addressing his show's week-long suspension by ABC. The suspension followed comments he made about the reaction of some MAGA supporters to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the murder or blame a specific group for the actions of a disturbed individual, acknowledging that his point was ill-timed or unclear. The controversy drew political pressure, including threats to broadcast licenses from the FCC, and prompted some local ABC affiliates to preempt the show's return.</p>

          <p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have identified a colossal object in the early universe that could be a primordial black hole. If confirmed, this discovery would challenge the standard cosmological model, which posits that stars formed before black holes. Primordial black holes are theorized to have formed from the spontaneous collapse of parts of the cosmos shortly after the Big Bang, predating any stars. While further observation is needed to verify the finding and rule out other possibilities, the existence of such an object would force a significant revision of our understanding of cosmic evolution.</p>

          <h2>Tom Brady Defends Dual Role as NFL Owner and Broadcaster Amid Criticism</h2>

          <p>Tom Brady has responded to criticism regarding his dual roles as a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster for Fox. Some argue his access to other teams' players and coaches as an analyst creates a conflict of interest and provides an unfair advantage. In his newsletter, Brady dismissed these concerns, stating that only those "blinded by distrust" would see a dilemma. He asserted that his passion for football creates a moral and ethical duty to improve the game, and he believes his intersecting roles emerge from this duty rather than from self-interest.</p>

The $1.6 billion joint mission will send the probes to an orbit one million miles from Earth to study solar storms, which can create auroras but also disrupt communications and endanger astronauts. The primary satellite, NASA's Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP), will provide a comprehensive picture of interstellar space and offer a 30-minute advance warning of solar storms, enhancing safety for future Artemis moon missions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell revealed that the league could start renegotiating its massive media rights deals as soon as 2026, four years ahead of the current agreement's opt-out clause. The existing 11-year, $111 billion deal signed in 2021 has an opt-out after the 2029-30 season. Goodell stated that the rapidly changing media landscape provides an incentive for both the league and its partners—including Disney, Comcast, Paramount, Amazon, and Fox—to potentially revisit the terms earlier to secure long-term control and increase annual revenue, which could in turn raise team valuations and the player salary cap.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa defender Ezri Konsa has publicly agreed with head coach Unai Emery's assessment that the team was "lazy" during their recent 1-1 draw with Sunderland. Emery was reportedly furious after the match, in which Villa conceded an equalizer despite their opponents playing with only 10 men for an hour. Konsa acknowledged the comment was fair and said that such criticism from a manager provides fuel for the players to prove everyone wrong in their next match. The draw left Aston Villa winless in their first five Premier League games of the season.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is diversifying its AI partnerships by incorporating models from Anthropic, a key rival to its primary partner OpenAI, into its Microsoft 365 Copilot assistant. Commercial clients will now have the option to use Anthropic's Claude models for certain tasks within Copilot, starting with the Researcher agent. This move signals a strategic shift for Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and has heavily relied on its technology for AI features across its products. The integration allows Microsoft to offer more choice to its enterprise customers and reduces its dependency on a single AI provider.</p>

          <p>Avani Yaltho, a high school senior from Houston, has won the grand prize in NPR's Student Podcast Challenge for her entry, "The Things We Buried." The podcast is a moving exploration of the cultural traditions and community life that have disappeared from her grandparents' home state of Kerala, India, due to urbanization and globalization. Through interviews with her family, Yaltho contrasts the communal past, symbolized by a shared mango tree, with the more isolated present. Judges praised the podcast for its beautiful narrative and skillful storytelling about what can be lost over generations.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam in minutes. Previously, AI struggled with the essay-based Level III exam, but a study by NYU Stern and Goodfin showed that frontier models like Claude Opus can now handle the complex analytical reasoning required. While this marks a significant technological milestone, the researchers believe AI will not replace human financial analysts, as humans excel in understanding the context, intent, and non-verbal cues crucial for client relationships.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. unexpectedly soared by 20.5% in August compared to July, marking the largest one-month gain since 2022 and reaching the highest level in three years. The surge occurred even as average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remained elevated throughout the month, before declining in September. Economists suggest the strong sales, which were highest in the Northeast and South, were likely driven by significant incentives offered by home builders to attract buyers. The robust demand reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from 9 months in July. (not investment advice)</p>

The bank's leadership views credit cards as a "huge opportunity" that could become a meaningful contributor to revenue, especially now that the Federal Reserve has lifted a punitive asset cap that had constrained its growth for years.

Created in 1990 as a monument to freedom, the site was once a hub for counterculture, with artists and squatters living in improvised dwellings along the Spree River. Today, that alternative scene has been replaced by luxury apartments, hotels, and corporate offices, reflecting Berlin's dramatic urban development. While the iconic art remains a major tourist attraction, the area's transformation highlights the ongoing tension between preserving historical spaces and accommodating modern real estate pressures.</p>
