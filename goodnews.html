          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance's summer trip to the United Kingdom was met with protests in the Cotswolds, where locals organized a "Vance not welcome party."

The protest, organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, was reportedly attended by about 80 people who expressed anger over Vance's past criticisms of the U.K. and the administration's foreign policy positions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. saw a significant 23% increase last week, reaching its highest level since last April. The spike was largely driven by homeowners seeking lower payments, with a notable 25% jump in applications for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) due to their more attractive initial rates compared to fixed-rate loans. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, borrowers with larger loan sizes are particularly sensitive to rate movements. In contrast, applications for home purchases saw only a minor 1% increase for the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The book "A Marriage at Sea" recounts the incredible survival story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, who were adrift on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean for 117 days in 1973 after a whale sank their sailboat. The couple endured starvation and illness, surviving on rainwater and turtles, with Maralyn's optimism often sustaining Maurice's will to live. The experience, while harrowing, is presented as a testament to their marital bond and shared sense of purpose.

          <p>For the first time since the market turmoil caused by the Liz Truss mini-budget in September 2022, the average rate for a two-year fixed mortgage in the U.K. has fallen to 4.99%. Moneyfacts described this as a "symbolic turning point," indicating increased competition among lenders, although rates remain significantly higher than pre-2022 levels. The news comes as 1.6 million homeowners are expected to remortgage this year. However, with inflation forecasts revised upwards, significant further drops in mortgage rates are considered unlikely.

          <p>Following a devastating magnitude 7.7 earthquake in central Myanmar, scientists are analyzing the event's data to enhance earthquake forecasting models. The quake, the most powerful in the region since 1912, caused thousands of deaths and widespread destruction. A new study suggests the Sagaing Fault has a "memory effect," with models indicating that large quakes occur there at irregular intervals of about 141 years. While precise prediction remains impossible, this research aims to improve long-term probabilistic hazard assessments, which are crucial for disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created a world-first intelligent breeding factory that uses a combination of gene editing and AI-driven robotics to speed up the development of new hybrid crops. By genetically modifying plants to have parts more easily accessible to robots for pollination, the team has reduced the time to create new varieties from five years to just one. This automated system is designed to produce crops with desirable traits like improved flavor and disease resistance. The integration of these technologies is seen as a major revolution in agricultural systems.</p>
