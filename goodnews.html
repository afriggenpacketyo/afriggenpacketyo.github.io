          <p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke highlighted growing risks in the corporate direct lending sector, noting an increase in borrowers deferring interest payments through "Payment-in-Kind" arrangements. He contrasted this with the healthier asset-based financing market, such as mortgages and auto loans, where consumer balance sheets remain strong. Stracke also discussed the trade-offs corporate borrowers face between more flexible but costly private debt and cheaper but more rigid public debt. He anticipates that future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will create new opportunities in credit markets, particularly for mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dozens of hand-sewn American flags intended for Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK were replaced at an estimated cost of £52,800 because the red stripes were not the correct shade. A government supplier claimed the US embassy objected to the standard red, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This last-minute change required the production of 66 new flags for display along the Mall and at Windsor Castle. The incident highlights the meticulous diplomatic preparations and expenses involved in hosting the unprecedented second state visit for the US President.</p>

          <p>Online fast-fashion giant Shein is set to open its first-ever permanent physical retail locations, choosing France for its debut. The company will establish "shop-in-shop" outlets within major department stores, starting in Paris before expanding to five other French cities. This move marks a significant strategy shift for the primarily e-commerce brand, which has previously only operated temporary pop-up stores. While Shein cites France's influential fashion market as key to its decision, the company continues to face scrutiny over its environmental impact and labor practices within its supply chain.</p>

          <p>MMA analyst Dan Hardy has labeled the upcoming PFL lightweight title rematch between Paul Hughes and Usman Nurmagomedov as the most significant fight in the promotion's history. He highlighted the intense confidence of Hughes, a Northern Irish fighter, as a key factor that unsettled the undefeated champion Nurmagomedov in their first encounter. Although Hughes lost that bout by unanimous decision, he pushed the champion harder than any previous opponent. Hardy anticipates Nurmagomedov will adopt a more wrestling-heavy strategy in the rematch, following what he expects was a rigorous training camp.</p>

          <h2>New Wave of Authentic Chinese Restaurants Gains Popularity in Paris</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurants is flourishing in Paris, offering authentic regional cuisines that cater to a younger, more diverse clientele beyond traditional Cantonese fare. Establishments like "Tonton Mao" are specializing in specific dishes, such as kaochuan meat skewers from northeastern China, and are importing chefs to ensure authenticity. This culinary trend reflects a shift in the city's Chinese food scene, moving away from generalized menus to provide more genuine and varied dining experiences. The boom is driven by new immigrants and a growing local appetite for diverse international food.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has submitted a new rescue plan aimed at preventing the financial collapse of Thames Water, the UK's largest water company. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion in new investment. Under the plan, which investors say would not require taxpayer funding, no dividends would be paid to shareholders during the turnaround period. The move comes after years of financial instability at the utility and aims to stabilize its finances and rebuild public trust.</p>

          <p>Switzerland's Defence Minister, Martin Pfister, is urging lawmakers to relax the country's strict arms export regulations, arguing the current stance undermines trust with international security partners. The proposed changes aim to bolster the domestic defense industry and facilitate cooperation, a sensitive issue for the neutral country which has blocked re-exports of its weapons to Ukraine. Pfister warned that Switzerland is vulnerable to threats like cyber attacks and drone incursions and must be able to cooperate with other armed forces. He emphasized that being a reliable partner is crucial for the nation's security.</p>

The $6.6 billion transaction solidifies OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable private company, surpassing SpaceX. While up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for sale, the lower participation is reportedly seen internally as a sign of confidence in the company's future. The deal provides liquidity for long-term employees and helps the company retain talent amid intense competition without pursuing an initial public offering.</p>
