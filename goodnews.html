        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may permit companies listed in Hong Kong to pursue secondary share listings on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, a move that could broaden fundraising avenues for these companies and potentially attract more businesses to list in Hong Kong. According to analysts, this would diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area, enabling them to expand operations in mainland China where their brands are better known. The dual-listing opportunity could also encourage more businesses to seek initial listings in Hong Kong, as it allows them to offer shares in both markets through a single application, further boosting Hong Kong's financial appeal. This policy shift represents a reversal of the existing A+H pathway, where mainland-listed companies can pursue dual listings in Hong Kong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about Donald Trump, acknowledging they "went too far" after a public disagreement between the two figures. This statement follows a period of heated exchanges, during which Musk criticized Trump's tax bill, leading Trump to declare their relationship over and express disinterest in reconciliation. Musk's comments reflect a softening of his stance after the former president's remarks, suggesting a possible attempt to de-escalate the conflict. The initial disagreement stemmed from differing views on economic policy and personal relations, showcasing the complexities of high-profile figures engaging in public disputes.</p>

Nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy if replicated at an industrial scale.

Countries are also reevaluating their U.S. dollar portfolios, recognizing that the dollar can be used as leverage in trade negotiations.
