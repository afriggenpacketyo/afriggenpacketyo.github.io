          <p>Ireland has committed to new legislation, ensuring full cooperation with the UK's reformed legacy body addressing Northern Ireland Troubles cases. This agreement, a "new framework" between British and Irish governments, includes establishing an Irish police legacy unit and a €25m victim support fund. The deal aims to mend previous rifts caused by the contentious 2023 UK Legacy Act, which faced widespread opposition. Both nations will pass new laws to implement these significant changes, reflecting efforts to achieve reconciliation and information recovery.</p>

          <p>Apple's iPhone 17 series launched worldwide, drawing significant consumer interest from Beijing to London. Despite initial positive demand, especially in China where Apple has lost market share to local rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi, the company faces pressure to demonstrate its artificial intelligence capabilities. The new models, including the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air, aim to rejuvenate sales with features like improved heat dissipation and larger storage. Investors are keenly watching Apple's AI advancements after a perceived underwhelming rollout of its AI features last year.</p>

          <p>Germany's refugee population decreased by approximately 50,000 in the first half of 2025, marking the first decline in over ten years. This reduction, from 3.55 million to 3.50 million, is attributed to increased deportations, voluntary departures, and naturalizations. The figures, released by the Left Party, include recent arrivals and long-term residents, as well as Ukrainian refugees. While some Syrians have gained German citizenship, concerns remain among critics that fewer people in need of protection are successfully entering the European Union.</p>

While headline inflation also dropped, the BOJ maintains a cautious stance amidst slowing inflation and global uncertainty, prioritizing stability over premature tightening.
