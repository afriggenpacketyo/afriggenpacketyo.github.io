          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Tianjin, pledging to peacefully resolve their long-standing border disputes. This marked Modi's first visit to China since deadly border clashes in 2020 strained relations between the two nations. Both leaders emphasized that the border issue should not define their entire relationship and that economic development should be the primary focus. The meeting occurred ahead of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit, signaling a mutual desire to stabilize ties.</p>

          <p>A global craze for matcha, driven by social media trends and its reputation as a health superfood, has led to significant shortages and record-high prices, even within Japan. The nation's aging farming communities are struggling to meet the demand for tencha, the labor-intensive tea used to produce the green powder. In response to the strain, retailers are implementing purchase limits and the Japanese government is considering subsidies to encourage more farmers to cultivate the lucrative crop.</p>

After dropping out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, she co-founded the AI data-labeling company Scale AI, which was recently acquired by Meta in a deal valuing it at $25 billion. Guo now leads Passes, a content creator monetization platform, although the company is currently facing a class-action lawsuit.</p>

          <p>New government data in England indicates that pupils who miss school during the first week of the academic year are significantly more likely to become persistently absent later on. According to the figures, 57% of students with partial attendance in week one went on to miss at least 10% of the school year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents and schools to "double down" on ensuring children are present from the start of term to combat post-pandemic absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Chelsea and England football star Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as essential for her well-being. The 32-year-old defender stated that after a grueling season, she was mentally and physically drained and on the verge of a breakdown. By prioritizing her health, undergoing knee surgery, and starting counseling, she now feels rejuvenated and proud of making a choice for herself rather than to please others.</p>

          <p>Dr. Sohan Dasgupta, a political appointee under the Trump administration, has exited the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) after a four-month tenure where he worked to reshape the agency as a strategic foreign policy tool. His focus was on shifting the MCC from a traditional aid provider to an investment body that prioritizes U.S. economic returns and counters Chinese influence. This realignment preserves the MCC as a key instrument of the "America First" agenda, even as other foreign aid programs face budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the tenth anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's influential "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it") speech, which signaled an open-door policy for hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. A decade later, the country is grappling with the complex legacy of this decision, weighing successes in integration against ongoing social and political challenges. The anniversary has renewed national debate on immigration policy, with current Chancellor Friedrich Merz adopting a more critical stance than his predecessor.</p>

          <p>In an innovative approach to wildlife management, biologists are using drones to protect cattle from gray wolf attacks in the western United States. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast startling sounds, including AC/DC's music and clips of human arguments, to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This non-lethal method aims to reduce conflicts between ranchers and the recovering wolf population, offering a creative alternative to lethal control measures, though its long-term effectiveness is still being studied.</p>

          <p>Recent US tariffs imposed on Indian goods, a response to Delhi's purchase of Russian oil, are creating a new incentive for India to strengthen its economic relationship with China. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, cooperation has become more appealing despite their ongoing geopolitical and border disputes. This context framed the recent meeting between their leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. The article suggests that shared economic challenges could lead to a strategic reset between the two Asian powers.</p>
