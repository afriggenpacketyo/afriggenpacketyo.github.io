This comes as direct security talks between Syria and Israel, facilitated by the U.S. government, are underway, signaling a departure from decades of hostility. Syrians interviewed express a desire to move beyond the 'Axis of Resistance' and prioritize their nation's interests, focusing on economic development and stability. Joseph Braude from the Center for Peace Communications emphasizes that many in Syria and Lebanon are rejecting the exploitation of the Palestinian issue by dictators, indicating a growing hope for new partnerships and improvements. The ongoing talks represent a significant step toward potential normalization, driven by a desire for reconstruction and peace.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives passed a multi-trillion-dollar tax and spending package, but the Senate is expected to make changes before finalizing the bill by July 4th.

It also approves significant spending cuts to programs for low-income families. Policy experts anticipate debate over the Medicaid provision and other changes as the Senate considers the bill, although it is thought that the overall bill will not be too different.

          <p>Many U.S. universities, historically divided by internal conflicts, are finding common ground in opposing the Trump administration's policies. Measures such as defunding research, increasing endowment taxes, and dictating admissions are uniting faculties, students, and alumni who were previously at odds. While some initially supported government intervention to address issues like antisemitism, the administration's severe tactics have alienated even those who favored change. This newfound unity aims to protect academic freedom and the integrity of higher education, with concerns that the administration's actions could harm the reputation of American universities and stifle innovation.</p>
