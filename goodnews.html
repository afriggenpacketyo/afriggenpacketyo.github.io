          <p>South Carolina is set to honor Civil War hero Robert Smalls by erecting a statue of him on the State Capitol grounds, a significant historical milestone. Smalls, who was born into slavery, famously commandeered a Confederate ship and delivered it to the Union, later becoming a U.S. congressman. His will be the first statue of a Black person to be placed at the state's capitol, joining monuments that predominantly honor white men, many of whom have ties to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. The move represents a major step in acknowledging the diverse history of the state.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to federal drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a Chicago court. Prosecutors allege Guzman Lopez was a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, overseeing a massive operation that trafficked fentanyl into the U.S. As part of his plea agreement, he has agreed to forfeit $80 million and must provide "substantial assistance" to the government. This cooperation could potentially involve testifying against his own brother and other cartel members, signaling a major development for U.S. authorities.</p>

The judge cited evidence of officers targeting clearly identifiable members of the press. The order protects journalists from being targeted unless they pose an imminent threat and prohibits police from obstructing them from their reporting duties.</p>
