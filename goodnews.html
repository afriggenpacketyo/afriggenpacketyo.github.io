The ground stop was lifted at 11:30 p.m. PT, but the airline anticipates further flight disruptions as they work to reposition aircraft and crews. Over 229 flights were canceled, and a flexible travel policy is in place to support affected passengers.

          <p>Ireland held its presidential election with over 3.6 million voters casting ballots to determine the next head of state. The main contenders are Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, representing the center-right governing party, Fine Gael. The election marks the first near two-way presidential contest since 1973, with results expected to be announced at Dublin Castle. The winner will serve a seven-year term, with the role carrying important constitutional duties despite being largely ceremonial. </p>

          <p>Two federal judges, Julien Xavier Neals and Henry Wingate, acknowledged that their staff used artificial intelligence to prepare court orders that contained errors. The admissions came after an inquiry by Senator Chuck Grassley, who described the court orders as "error-ridden." Both judges stated that the rulings did not undergo their chambers' usual review processes, and they have since implemented measures to improve ruling reviews. The use of AI in legal research and drafting is now explicitly prohibited in Judge Neals's chamber, and Judge Wingate replaced the erroneous order. </p>
