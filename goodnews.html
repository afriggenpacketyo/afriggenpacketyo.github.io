        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a ruling that addresses presidential power, the Supreme Court suggested that Federal Reserve board members have special protection against being fired by a president, while allowing President Trump to remove two members of other federal agencies' boards. The court's decision emphasized the unique structure of the Federal Reserve. Justice Kagan dissented, arguing that the majority's ruling created an unnecessary exemption for the Federal Reserve, potentially undermining the independence of other administrative bodies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that he would not resign if asked by President Trump, asserting that the president lacks the authority to remove him. </p>

          <p>House Republicans passed a domestic policy bill that would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from consequences for violating court orders. The provision, tucked into a tax and spending cut bill, aims to curb the power of federal courts to issue injunctions blocking Trump's executive actions. Democrats argue that the measure would undermine the judiciary by removing any consequences for officials who disregard judges' rulings. The provision would apply retroactively, affecting ongoing cases where federal judges are considering holding Trump administration officials in contempt. </p>
