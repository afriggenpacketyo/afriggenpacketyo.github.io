          <p>The Trump administration has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing reciprocal tariffs of 15% on Japanese exports. The agreement, which President Trump described as possibly the largest ever, includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American goods like cars and agricultural products. This development caused Japanese auto stocks to soar, as the new tariff rate is lower than the previously threatened 25%, providing relief to Japan's cornerstone auto industry.

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back 250 years. Originally a Royal Navy frigate named HMS Hind, the ship participated in the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. It ultimately wrecked in a storm off Orkney in 1788, with all crew members surviving. The identification was made possible through scientific analysis and dedicated research by the local island community, which has rallied to preserve the historic timbers.</p>
