          <p>This article explains the critical consequences for seniors who fail to meet their obligations on a reverse mortgage, such as paying property taxes, insurance, or maintaining their home. Default can lead to the entire loan balance becoming immediately due, swift foreclosure proceedings, and a negative impact on credit scores. While highlighting these severe risks, the article also emphasizes that reverse mortgages can be a valuable financial tool for retirees, providing access to home equity without monthly payments, especially for those who are house-rich but cash-poor.

          <p>Americans now aim for $1.26 million to retire comfortably in 2025, a goal missed by 97% of the population, highlighting the urgency of early and strategic investing. The article explores various investment avenues, including micro-investing apps like Acorns, alternative assets like real estate through Homeshares, fine art via Masterworks, and gold investments through Priority Gold. It stresses that starting early is crucial, as a 20-year-old needs to invest significantly less monthly than a 50-year-old to reach the millionaire milestone. Consulting a financial advisor is recommended to personalize retirement planning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, met with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss enhancing freight rail efficiency, though he clarified that Berkshire Hathaway is not interested in acquiring CSX. This announcement led to a drop in shares for CSX, Union Pacific, and Norfolk Southern, which had seen gains amid acquisition speculation. The meeting follows a new partnership between Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF Railway and CSX to offer coast-to-coast rail services, aiming for the benefits of collaboration without a merger. This strategic move emphasizes operational improvements over consolidation in the rail sector.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is set to receive 3,350 Extended Range Attack Munitions (ERAM) from the US, significantly boosting its standoff strike capabilities with these relatively low-cost, air-launched missiles. The weapons, with a range of 150-280 miles, are expected to arrive in approximately six weeks, with most funding provided by European allies. While their use against targets deep within Russia may require Pentagon approval, ERAM will enable Ukraine to strike targets far behind front lines, offsetting Russian advantages. This development also highlights the growing importance of rapidly producible, affordable long-range weapons for the US military.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, in a Maryland patient who had traveled to El Salvador. While the risk to public health is deemed very low, the detection has heightened alerts for the country's cattle industry, as the parasite has been spreading northward from South America. Federal authorities are ramping up efforts, including building a new sterile fly production facility in Texas and increasing border surveillance. These measures aim to prevent a wider outbreak, leveraging historical success in eradicating screwworm from the U.S. in the mid-20th century.</p>
