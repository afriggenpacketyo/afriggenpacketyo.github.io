          <p>Newly promoted sumo grand champion Onosato has announced his goal to win the upcoming Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, a feat rarely achieved by wrestlers in their yokozuna debut. The 25-year-old is the first Japanese-born wrestler to reach the sport's highest rank since 2017, drawing significant attention. Speaking at a press conference, Onosato acknowledged the difficulty of the challenge, as only five of the last thirty yokozuna won their debut tournament. He also expressed his desire to energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake earlier this year.</p>

Notable storylines include Ryder Cup veteran Ian Poulter competing against his 21-year-old son, Luke, at the same qualifying event in Kent. Other LIV tour members like Graeme McDowell and Lee Westwood are also attempting to qualify, a necessary route due to their affiliation with the breakaway league. The high-stakes, 36-hole qualifying events represent a final, intense hurdle for players dreaming of competing in golf's oldest major.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a Digital Services Tax that would have primarily affected major U.S. technology companies. This move came after President Trump suspended trade talks, calling the proposed tax a "blatant attack." Following a phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump, Canada announced it would rescind the tax, which was set to take effect Monday, in anticipation of a broader trade deal. The decision allows for the resumption of negotiations aimed at easing a series of steep tariffs and resolving ongoing trade disputes between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he has assembled a group of "very wealthy people" who are ready to acquire the U.S. operations of TikTok. The popular social media platform faces a potential ban under a 2024 law unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divests from it due to national security concerns. Trump, who has extended the divestiture deadline to September 17, stated he could reveal the identities of the potential buyers within two weeks. He acknowledged that any deal would likely require approval from Beijing but expressed optimism that Chinese President Xi Jinping would permit it. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's customs authority announced a conditional and immediate resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a blanket ban imposed in 2023. The prohibition was enacted in response to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The lifted restrictions will not apply to seafood from ten Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima. This move signals a potential, albeit limited, thaw in trade relations between the two Asian powers, which had been strained by the controversial water discharge.</p>
