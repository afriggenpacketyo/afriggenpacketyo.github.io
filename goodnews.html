        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government rules may allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet agreed-upon delivery time frames. Housebuilders will be required to commit to specific time frames before obtaining planning permission and submit annual progress reports to councils. Developers who repeatedly miss targets could face penalties or be denied future permissions, with fines potentially reaching thousands per unbuilt home. The government aims to address the housing crisis by building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, while housing charities emphasize the need for more social housing construction. </p>

          <p>A power cut in southern France, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival. The outage, affecting about 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas, was attributed to an electricity substation being set on fire and a pylon at another location being damaged. Despite the disruption, organizers of the international film festival confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an alternative power supply. The incident prompted investigations into the suspected sabotage. </p>
