          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge following the company's announcement that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve as competition from copycat compounded drugs diminishes. The Danish pharmaceutical giant had previously reported lower-than-expected first-quarter sales due to these alternative versions impacting their U.S. market share. However, the FDA's decision to end a drug shortage ruling will allow Novo Nordisk to regain business growth, with CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen emphasizing the company's commitment to pursuing unlawful distributors of copycat drugs. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy to provide a safe alternative to compounded drugs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 years old in an effort to address driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the change as a measure to improve train services and create job opportunities. Union Aslef supports the move, stating it will open opportunities for school leavers, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board assures that research indicates 18-year-olds can safely become train drivers. The Department for Transport hopes this change will alleviate cancellations caused by driver shortages, as the average age of train drivers is 48, with a significant portion nearing retirement.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a gene in upland rice roots linked to drought resistance, potentially transforming irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties. The research identified the HMGB1 gene, which obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could enable rice to thrive in water-scarce environments, enhancing food security in regions facing drought conditions, as the researchers emphasize the importance of the HMGB1 gene as a key factor in facilitating root elongation and thickening in upland rice.</p>
