          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth dismissed China's concerns that the Golden Dome project would militarize space, asserting its sole purpose is to protect the United States. Hegseth highlighted President Trump's "America First" policy and the $125 billion investment in the missile defense shield, slated for completion in three years. He also defended his decision to initiate Christian prayer services at the Pentagon, citing historical precedent and religious freedom. Hegseth celebrated the renaming of Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg and announced increased jump pay for paratroopers, shifting resources to prioritize quality over quantity within the Army's parachutist ranks.

The Fujian, equipped with advanced electromagnetic catapults, is the People‚Äôs Liberation Army‚Äôs third carrier. This carrier is expected to significantly boost the Chinese navy's capabilities in offshore defense and long-distance escort operations once it enters service, marking a significant advancement in China's naval power.</p>

          <p>This excerpt from Laurie Gwen Shapiro's "The Aviator and the Showman" recounts Amelia Earhart's initial meeting with publisher George Palmer Putnam, who sought a female pilot to replicate Charles Lindbergh's success. Putnam, orchestrating a power play, eventually met with Earhart, a social worker and part-time aviator, to discuss a confidential project: to find a female passenger to be the first to cross the Atlantic. Railey, a PR guy, felt that Putnam undeniably fell in love at first sight with Earhart, who was poised to become his next great triumph.</p>

          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi. This expectation follows the dismissal of his predecessor due to controversial remarks about receiving gifted rice, which angered consumers amid high inflation. The poll also indicates that many believe rice prices should fall below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, reflecting public concern over the cost of living. The survey highlights public sentiment regarding government policies and leadership changes in addressing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the first nationalized service departing on time. The government called it a "new dawn for rail" but stopped short of promising lower fares, focusing instead on service improvements and infrastructure investment. Unions have raised concerns about outsourcing staffing, while the opposition Conservatives are calling for Labour to deliver on its promises. Two more rail firms are slated for public ownership later this year, following four others under previous Conservative governments.</p>
