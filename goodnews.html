          <p>Shares of online brokerage Robinhood surged after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index, effective September 22. This long-anticipated move typically triggers significant buying from passive investment funds that track the index, boosting a company's stock value. The inclusion follows a period of strong performance for Robinhood, with its stock price having more than tripled in 2025. The news represents a major milestone for the company, which has experienced considerable volatility since its 2021 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid signs of a weakening U.S. job market, financial experts are offering advice to those who have lost their jobs on how to manage their student loan debt. Options for federal loan borrowers include income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower monthly payments, sometimes to zero, and deferment programs for unemployment or economic hardship. The article emphasizes that borrowers must be proactive in contacting their lenders to explore these relief options. It notes that while private loan options may be more limited, lenders may still offer assistance if informed of a borrower's situation. (not investment advice)</p>

A strong credit score and history, a low debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, and stable employment are crucial for securing favorable terms. The loan amount and repayment term also significantly influence the interest rate offered. The piece advises borrowers to compare offers from different types of lenders, including banks and credit unions, to find the most advantageous loan for their financial situation.

          <p>A moose that wandered into northeastern Austria, likely from Poland, has become a local celebrity and a minor disruption. Nicknamed Emil, the animal recently caused a several-hour shutdown of a major railway line after appearing on the tracks at the main station in St. Pölten. A Facebook fan page dedicated to the wayward moose has attracted over 10,000 members. Since moose are not native to Austria, Emil's presence has been a source of public fascination, though officials are urging people to keep a safe distance.</p>

          <p>As homeowners face rising living costs, financial experts are advising on the wise use of home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs). They recommend using these funds for value-adding home improvements or consolidating high-interest debt, as long as the borrower maintains financial discipline. Conversely, they caution against using home equity for risky, speculative investments or to fund an unsustainable lifestyle, as this puts the home at risk of foreclosure.
