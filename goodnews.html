          <p>Maryland officials conducted a profound reinterment ceremony for 65 early Catholic settlers at Historic St. Mary's City, more than 300 years after their original burials. This event, attended by the Archbishop of Baltimore, honored these individuals who established a precedent for religious liberty in North America, a fundamental aspect of the American experience. Researchers meticulously studied the remains, uncovering valuable insights into colonial life, including chronic illnesses and diet, with findings slated for a future publication. The ceremony aimed to restore dignity to these long-forgotten founders and underscore the enduring legacy of tolerance and coexistence they championed in the 1600s, positioning St. Mary's City alongside Jamestown and Plymouth in historical significance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland for at least 14 days. Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's stated basis for the deployment, citing chaos, was "untethered to the facts" and that protests were not significantly violent enough to justify military intrusion without the governor's consent. This decision, which emphasizes the constitutional separation of civil and military power, was lauded by Oregon officials, who viewed it as a crucial win for state sovereignty and a rebuke to federal overreach, affirming local control over law enforcement matters.</p>

          <p>Queuing, traditionally perceived as an inconvenience, is evolving into a sought-after social activity, particularly for exclusive product launches and brand experiences in urban centers like London. Individuals are now dedicating hours, sometimes overnight, to stand in line, driven not solely by the desire for a luxury item or freebie, but also by the sense of camaraderie and community formed with fellow enthusiasts. Psychologists attribute this phenomenon to the dopamine release from anticipation and the allure of exclusivity. Brands are capitalizing on this trend through "experiential marketing," creating immersive events with unique offerings and photo opportunities, effectively transforming the act of waiting into an engaging and shareable experience.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), the largest US Lutheran denomination, has made history by installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop. Curry, 53, who has a unique path to Lutheran leadership from a Catholic background, will serve a six-year term, succeeding the first woman to hold the position. His installation is celebrated as a landmark moment for the predominantly white denomination, signaling a move towards greater diversity and representation. While the ELCA faces challenges like declining membership, Curry's leadership is anticipated to foster more connections within the church and highlight the enduring contributions of African Americans to Lutheranism globally.</p>

          <p>Thousands of individuals defied a police ban to participate in a Pride march in Pecs, Hungary, protesting Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government and its increasing restrictions on LGBTQ+ rights. Orban's ruling Fidesz party had enacted a law permitting Pride bans, citing child protection, a measure upheld by the Supreme Court, with attendees facing potential fines. Despite these deterrents, an estimated 7,000 to 8,000 demonstrators, including several Members of the European Parliament, marched with rainbow and EU flags, openly accusing the government of dictatorial tendencies. This act of defiance follows a larger banned march in Budapest earlier this year, highlighting persistent public resistance to the government's repressive legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freshers' flu," a prevalent illness among new university students, is identified as a collection of common cold viruses, intensified by the unique environment of campus life. Immunologists explain that the convergence of thousands of students from diverse backgrounds creates a "mixing pot" of novel respiratory infections. Compounding this, factors such as late-night socializing, crowded lectures, communal living, poor dietary habits, and the stress of adapting to university life collectively suppress the immune system, rendering students highly susceptible. While typically not serious, experts recommend adequate rest and medical consultation for persistent symptoms, emphasizing the body's need for recovery.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting a Trump administration initiative to transfer immigrant children into adult detention facilities upon their 18th birthdays, preventing scheduled transfers for the weekend. US District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that this automatic detention violates a previous 2021 court order mandating release to the "least restrictive setting" for eligible individuals. This legal challenge underscores ongoing controversies surrounding Trump's immigration policies, which also face accusations of reviving family separations and offering financial incentives for children to self-deport, practices criticized for coercing vulnerable individuals and undermining their legal claims.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis converged on Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, expressing cautious optimism and celebrating the potential Gaza ceasefire deal, with many crediting President Trump for his perceived role in brokering the agreement. Protesters, some wearing Trump masks, voiced criticism towards Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, accusing him of prioritizing political gain over securing the hostages' immediate release. The proposed 20-point plan outlines a hostage-for-prisoner exchange and a phased Israeli withdrawal. Despite Netanyahu's public statements about achieving a "great achievement" and maintaining control in Gaza, the demonstrators' primary message was a fervent desire for the return of all hostages and a return to normalcy.</p>
