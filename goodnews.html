          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. This contribution represents the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution and aims to revolutionize cancer research, diagnosis, and patient care. The gift builds upon a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in funds raised by the institute a decade ago. The Knights are renowned philanthropists, with lifetime giving estimated at over $3.6 billion, reflecting their commitment to transformative societal investments.</p>

          <p>AI software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge in market value, with its stock rising over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut and its valuation now exceeding $430 billion. The company's growth is largely fueled by significant government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite having a fraction of the revenue of other tech giants, Palantir's high forward price-to-earnings ratio indicates strong investor confidence in its AI capabilities. The article highlights the company's rapid ascent, its reliance on U.S. government deals, and the premium investors are paying for its stock (not investment advice).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time since 2018, boys in the UK have surpassed girls in achieving the top A-level grades of A* or A, with 28.4% of boys' entries reaching this level compared to 28.2% for girls. This narrow but significant reversal is partly attributed to the increasing popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are taken by a higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While more girls achieved at least an A grade overall due to higher entry numbers, the trend highlights a shift in subject choices, with business and economics also rising in popularity while humanities subjects decline.</p>

          <p>A Glasgow school pupil, Rebecca Young, has been recognized as one of Time magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for her invention of a solar-powered heated blanket designed to help homeless individuals. She conceived the idea at age 12, which was then developed into a working prototype by engineering firm Thales and distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, which is a partnership with Lego, Rebecca is featured on a digital cover of the magazine as a mini-figure. The award highlights young people who are making a real-world impact by turning their innovative ideas into practical solutions for their communities.</p>

          <p>Apple has released iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1, software updates that restore the blood oxygen monitoring feature for Apple Watch users in the United States. The functionality had been removed from new and repaired devices earlier this year due to a patent dispute with the medical technology company Masimo. With the update, the redesigned feature will now process the collected data on the user's paired iPhone, with results displayed in the Health app. This restoration is seen as a positive step that could pave the way for other anticipated health features, such as blood pressure monitoring, in future Apple Watch models.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy's Class of 2025 has posthumously honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Parkland school shooting. Wang, who dreamed of attending West Point, was posthumously accepted into the class and has now been given an Honorary Graduate Award after numerous nominations from his would-be classmates. He was killed while holding a door open to help other students escape the gunman, an act for which the U.S. Army awarded him the Medal of Heroism. His classmates will mail the honorary diploma to his parents, ensuring his sacrifice is remembered as part of their class identity.</p>

          <h2>Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods Diverge on Strategy for Plant-Based Future</h2>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry's two leading companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are adopting divergent strategies to attract consumers. Facing criticism that its products are overly processed, Beyond Meat is rebranding to focus on simpler ingredients, launching a neutral-flavored "Beyond Ground" made from fava beans. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on its meat-like appeal, launching more "indulgent" products, embracing a "meatier" brand identity, and standing by its genetically engineered heme ingredient for authentic flavor. These opposing bets on whether consumers prioritize "clean" ingredients or taste will shape the future of the stagnant plant-based market.</p>

          <p>Louis Naidorf, the visionary architect who designed Los Angeles's iconic, circular Capitol Records Building, has died at the age of 96. Hired by a major firm at just 21, he was entrusted with the secret project at 24, applying concepts from his master's thesis to create the world's first round office building in 1956. His extensive portfolio also includes the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the Beverly Hilton hotel, and Phoenix's Chase Tower. A dedicated mentor, Naidorf later became the dean of Woodbury University’s School of Architecture, encouraging students to blend logic with creativity and to design with humanity in mind.</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reaffirmed the insurer's commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political pushback in the US and UK. The statement came as Aviva's shares reached their highest point since the 2008 financial crisis following strong profit growth. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the company's core insurance business, which is directly impacted by the rising frequency of extreme weather events like floods and wildfires. This stance contrasts with several major US and UK banks that have recently withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance amid a shifting political climate.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 12:34:41 EDT</div>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.58%, its lowest point in nearly ten months, according to Freddie Mac. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declines, offering a measure of relief and increased purchasing power for prospective homebuyers in a housing market that has been stagnant due to high borrowing costs. The recent drop in rates is linked to a fall in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate. However, economists still expect mortgage rates to remain above 6% for the remainder of the year (not investment advice).</p>
