          <h2>China's Humanoid Robot Firms Offer High Salaries Amid Talent Shortage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 22:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese companies in the rapidly growing humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the national urban average to attract engineers and AI specialists. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is around 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with higher salaries for those with more experience. This surge in pay stands out in China's subdued hiring landscape, which is under pressure from slowing economic growth and corporate earnings. The demand for talent in humanoid robotics underscores the sector's importance in China's technological development.</p>

          <h2>Sharks and Oysters May Thrive in Warmer UK Waters, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 21:57:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists predict that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could flourish in warmer UK waters as species shift habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas. While some species like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle, mobile species like basking sharks and native oysters are expected to adapt well, potentially doubling their habitats. This analysis aims to guide government planning for Marine Protected Areas to ensure they continue to protect species despite changing environments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Mark Carney, was overshadowed by the escalating war between Israel and Iran and President Trump's early departure. Despite these disruptions, leaders addressed trade, Ukraine, and other global issues, with Carney emphasizing long-term resilience over short-term efficiency. Trump's abrupt exit raised questions about US commitment, while the summit produced joint statements on artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and critical minerals. The G7 also urged de-escalation in the Middle East, though it stopped short of calling for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Rafael Devers has expressed enthusiasm for his new role with the San Francisco Giants after being traded by the Boston Red Sox. Despite being a natural third baseman, Devers is willing to play wherever the Giants need him, a different tone from his time with the Red Sox. The Giants are assuming financial responsibility for the remainder of Devers' 10-year contract and are excited about his potential contribution to the team. This change comes after Devers' relationship with the Red Sox front office became strained over his position and willingness to adapt to team needs.</p>

As a result, some resorts in the Mediterranean are adapting by offering indoor activities and evening markets, while destinations in Scandinavia and other northern regions are gaining popularity.</p>

Nezza, a social media personality, sang the Spanish version of "The Star-Spangled Banner" after being told to sing it in English. While a Dodgers official initially told her not to contact them again, the team has since clarified that there are "no hard feelings" and that she is not banned from the stadium.

The film touches on issues ranging from ICE raids and spirituality to babysitting, reflecting the realities faced by the trans community. Pe√±a drew inspiration from her own experiences and the stories of fellow trans individuals, aiming to address the lack of representation in mainstream media. The film's format was influenced by global cinema and filmed over several years due to funding constraints.</p>
