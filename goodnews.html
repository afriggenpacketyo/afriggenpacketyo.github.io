          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 18:22:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AppLovin's shares experienced a significant increase after exceeding earnings and revenue expectations and revealing the sale of its mobile gaming business to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash, with AppLovin also acquiring a 20% stake in Tripledot. The company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, driven by strong performance in its ad-tech sector. However, AppLovin's second-quarter sales projections of $1.2 billion to $1.22 billion fell short of analyst forecasts. The sale of the mobile gaming business is expected to close in the second quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's shares saw an increase following the Trump administration's decision to reverse the "AI diffusion rule," which would have imposed restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips. The Department of Commerce stated that the existing rule was overly complex and hindered American innovation, prompting a simpler replacement to ensure American AI dominance. Chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD have opposed the restrictions, with Nvidia's CEO emphasizing the potential loss of being excluded from the Chinese AI market. The article states that the original restrictions were set to take effect on May 15.</p>

          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for North Carolina's state Supreme Court, conceded the race to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs, ending his six-month effort to challenge the election results. Griffin's concession followed a judge's rejection of his legal challenges, a decision that boosts Democrats' chances of regaining the majority on the court in 2028. The ruling by Chief Judge Richard E. Myers II, appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, marks a significant victory for Democrats in the swing state. Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the Republican-majority court.</p>
