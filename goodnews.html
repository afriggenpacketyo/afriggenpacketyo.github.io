          <p>David Kaczynski, who identified his brother Ted as the Unabomber, has formed a close friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of Ted's bombs in 1987. After turning his brother in, David felt immense guilt and began reaching out to victims' families to apologize. This led to a connection with Wright, and over the years, the two have shared their story publicly, demonstrating how compassion can emerge from profound violence and tragedy. Their bond serves as a powerful example of reconciliation and healing, offering a glimmer of hope in an otherwise dark chapter of American history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets prevent people from increasing their income, rather than a lack of intelligence or desire. The first limiting belief is the shame of admitting you don't know how to earn more, which stops people from seeking necessary help or education. Another is the false expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the need for patience and consistent effort. Finally, the habit of procrastinating by telling oneself they will start "later" allows dreams to fade without any action ever being taken.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting construction on three new towns before the next general election as a cornerstone of its economic growth strategy. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, which aims to deliver 1.5 million new homes by 2029, drawing inspiration from the post-war government's housing initiatives. While the party is enthusiastic, the construction industry has warned of significant challenges, including rising costs and taxes that could impede the ambitious target. Additionally, some residents in the earmarked areas have expressed concern over a lack of communication about the scale of the proposed developments.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Social Media Trend Claiming Magnesium Lotion on Feet Improves Sleep</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 09:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the bottoms of one's feet before bed can improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but health experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists and sleep psychologists point to a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin to induce sleep. They note that the skin on the soles of the feet is particularly thick, making absorption unlikely. Experts suggest any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing effect of a nightly foot massage routine rather than the magnesium itself.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos across the United States are installing personal air quality sensors to gather data on pollution in their neighborhoods, which are disproportionately affected by toxic air. This grassroots effort, supported by organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to fill data gaps left by official government monitoring, which often overlooks communities of color. By tracking pollutants like PM2.5 from nearby industrial sites and traffic, residents are empowering themselves with information to advocate for stronger regulations and better public health protections. Their work comes as the Trump administration moves to roll back numerous environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing threat of fires in urban areas, the United States has made significant progress in fire safety over the past four decades. Since 1980, the total number of reported fires has been cut in half, and the per-capita civilian fire death rate has dropped by approximately two-thirds. This success is attributed to an accumulation of small but crucial improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinkler systems. Other key factors include safer furniture standards, a significant decline in smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety codes in modern construction.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a referendum on whether to introduce an optional, state-controlled electronic identity card system, with early projections showing the nation is evenly divided. This is the second time the issue has been put to a vote, after a 2021 proposal involving private firms was rejected over data privacy concerns. The revised plan keeps the system entirely in public hands, with data stored on users' smartphones instead of a central database. Supporters argue it will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents fear it could still undermine Switzerland's long-held tradition of protecting citizen privacy.</p>

Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing its creation in the historical period after European contact.
