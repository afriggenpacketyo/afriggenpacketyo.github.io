          <p>Republican Representative Don Bacon has voiced his opposition to President Donald Trump's proposed rescission measure, which includes cuts to global health programs, particularly those related to AIDS prevention.

The White House official stated that the rescission package aims to eliminate wasteful programming without affecting life-saving assistance. Bacon has previously demonstrated independence from Trump, such as voting against renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.

          <p>The Labour Party hopes to resolve the controversy surrounding the winter fuel payment policy. Rachel Reeves initially limited the payment to pensioners receiving pension credit or means-tested benefits, saving ¬£1.5 billion annually. This decision sparked criticism and complaints from Labour MPs and voters, particularly during local elections. The government has since reversed course in three stages, adjusting the threshold and expanding eligibility for the upcoming winter. Some suggest the initial decision reflected genuine concerns about the Treasury's financial state, while others believe the government could have handled the situation better from the start.</p>

          <p>The city of Glendale, California, has ended its 18-year contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to hold detainees, citing public safety, transparency, and community trust as core values. The decision follows rising tensions over immigration raids in the Los Angeles area and reports that Glendale continued the contract despite California's sanctuary state law. The city maintains its agreement complied with state law but acknowledges the divisive public perception of the ICE contract. The move is praised by immigrant rights advocates, who see it as a step toward rebuilding trust in the community, while the city recognizes it will make visitation more difficult for some families.</p>

          <h2>China Extends Rare Earths Olive Branch to Western Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 09:05:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China appears to be easing restrictions on rare earth exports to Western automakers after concerns about a potential shortage. The Ministry of Commerce is willing to establish a "green channel" for EU firms and has granted licenses to suppliers of U.S. auto giants. This move comes after trade talks between Chinese and EU officials and amid earlier restrictions imposed in response to U.S. tariffs. Experts caution that while this is good news, supply chain diversification is still needed. (not investment advice)</p>
