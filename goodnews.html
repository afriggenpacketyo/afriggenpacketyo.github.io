          <p>Two indigenous artists from American Samoa, Su'a Uilisone Fitiao and Reggie Meredith Fitiao, are creating traditional artworks at Chicago's Field Museum. Their work is part of a new exhibit set to open in 2026, aiming to add American Samoan culture to the museum's Pacific collections, which currently focus on Hawaii. Su'a is carving an outrigger for a 19th-century canoe, while Reggie is creating a "siapo," a traditional bark cloth art piece using natural dyes and materials. The artists hope their work will preserve their ancient traditions and educate future generations about their deep connection to nature.</p>

After years of running marathons for charity to process her trauma and celebrate her health, she found herself too weak from chemotherapy to continue. Now cancer-free again, she is channeling her resilience into a new challenge: riding the two-day Pan-Mass Challenge. Her story is one of profound perseverance, turning multiple life-threatening experiences into a mission to raise money for cancer research and celebrate life.</p>

          <p>The iconic 1939 film "The Wizard of Oz" is being adapted into a new immersive experience at the Las Vegas Sphere, set to open on August 28. The project will utilize the venue's massive wraparound screen, 16K resolution, and advanced sound system to place audiences directly inside the world of Oz. Engineers used AI to expand the original film frames to fit the unique screen, while 4D effects like wind, fog, and haptic seating will simulate key moments from the movie, such as the tornado scene. This event continues the Sphere's trend of hosting unique, technologically advanced entertainment.</p>

          <p>A new study from Swiss researchers indicates that the human immune system can be activated simply by seeing a sick-looking person, even a virtual one. In the experiment, participants viewed avatars in virtual reality, some of which appeared to have rashes or a cough. Brain monitoring showed increased alarm signals when a "sick" avatar approached, and subsequent blood tests revealed heightened activity of innate lymphoid cells, which are key to the early stages of an immune response. The findings suggest the brain can trigger a defensive reaction before any pathogen actually enters the body, opening potential new therapeutic avenues.</p>
