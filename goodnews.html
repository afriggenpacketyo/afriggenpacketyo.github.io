          <p>Meta is rolling out its "Teen Accounts" with default safety protections to Facebook and Messenger, following their introduction on Instagram. The article notes strong initial adoption and parental approval but also highlights significant criticism from child-safety advocates and researchers who argue the measures are not robust enough to prevent harm. Meta is also partnering with schools and launching an online safety curriculum to further its efforts, though the debate over the efficacy of these protections continues, with the company strongly defending its tools against what it calls misleading reports.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher shares the story of his decision to leave a successful management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a small online startup called Amazon. Despite Bill Gates calling it the "stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision, which included an intense focus on the customer experience and a bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000. Risher was drawn to the opportunity to be part of building a transformative company, a goal Amazon achieved a year ahead of schedule, reaching $1.6 billion in revenue by 1999.</p>

          <p>A child life specialist and therapist shares a personal parenting practice: creating an email address for each of her children at birth to serve as a digital time capsule. She regularly sends messages on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to document their lives and her unwavering love and support. The expert suggests this practice creates a valuable legacy and a collection of memories that can be shared with the children at a milestone age or provide comfort in case of tragedy. This method serves as both a keepsake for the child and a journaling outlet for the parent.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance its operational efficiency, improve corporate governance by collapsing its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. The firm argues that despite strong revenue growth and high customer retention, Workiva's lack of profitability and founder-controlled structure have led to an undervalued stock price. Irenic has proposed adding two new members to the board and has not ruled out a proxy fight. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Mexico Uranium Plant Expands to Meet Surging Demand from Nuclear Power and AI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 08:40:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is expanding its capacity to meet a resurgence in demand for nuclear power. This renewed interest is driven by the need to power AI data centers and a bipartisan push to reduce reliance on Russian uranium, which the U.S. will ban by 2028. The facility, which faced a downturn after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, is now a critical part of the U.S. strategy to build a domestic nuclear supply chain. However, the entire supply chain, particularly uranium conversion, faces significant bottlenecks that must be addressed to meet ambitious new energy goals.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of the Gaza ceasefire deal outlined by President Trump, notably the release of all living hostages and the remains of the deceased. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the 20-point proposal would require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated that Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan immediately. The proposal calls for an end to fighting, a phased Israeli withdrawal, and the transfer of Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, defeated a more moderate opponent in a runoff vote. Her election is seen as an effort by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and win back conservative voters. As prime minister, she is expected to focus on strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and addressing domestic economic challenges, while navigating complex regional dynamics.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after she proactively sought early screening. Despite having no symptoms, a breast MRI ordered by a high-risk clinic revealed two suspicious masses, leading to a diagnosis of invasive ductal carcinoma. Because the cancer was caught early, her prognosis is excellent, and her case highlights the importance of self-advocacy and early detection, especially for those with known risk factors. Doctors emphasize that women should discuss their family history with physicians in their 20s to create an appropriate screening plan.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a choice that was deeply connected to her ethical and environmental principles. She famously decided to stop eating meat after looking at a pork chop and seeing it as a representation of "fear, pain, death." Goodall cited the cruelty of factory farming and the significant environmental damage caused by meat production as her primary motivations. She often spoke about feeling physically better after making the switch and advocated for others to reduce meat consumption for the health of both themselves and the planet.</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that a prestigious college brand guarantees value is weakening, as families increasingly prioritize practical outcomes like cost, career placement, and hands-on learning. With soaring tuition and a challenging job market, many parents are questioning the worth of an elite degree, leading to more fluidity in college rankings. Schools once considered regional brands have risen to national prominence, while families are now more willing to choose less-prestigious institutions that offer significant merit aid. This shift reflects a growing view of college as a tangible investment rather than an abstract symbol of status.</p>

At a recent conference, scholars noted that the genre has historically been dominated by Western, often dystopian, narratives rooted in capitalist ideologies. In contrast, they suggest that Chinese science fiction can present different possibilities and critiques of the present.
