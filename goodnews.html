        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled to limit the authority of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a decision celebrated by the Trump administration. The ruling addresses the frequent use of such injunctions by a small number of liberal-leaning courts to block the administration's policies on a national scale. Attorney General Pam Bondi noted that of 40 universal injunctions against the current administration, 35 originated from just five federal districts. This decision curtails a legal strategy that conservatives argue was used to obstruct a democratically elected president's agenda through judicial overreach, restoring some executive authority.</p>

His set included iconic songs like "Maggie May" and "Sailing," and featured a guest appearance by his former Faces bandmate, Ronnie Wood. Despite his age and a voice showing signs of wear, Stewart's energy was high, and his stage banter was characteristically eccentric. He dedicated a song to Glastonbury founder Michael Eavis for his 90th birthday, creating a touching moment during the nostalgic and crowd-pleasing performance.</p>

          <p>Interim WBC champion Kenia Enr√≠quez has signed an exclusive multi-fight deal with MMA organization Combate Global, citing frustration with the lack of opportunities in professional boxing. The Tijuana native, who holds an undefeated record since 2015, accused boxing's governing bodies of preventing her from unifying her title against the current champion. Feeling disrespected and stalled, Enr√≠quez made a successful MMA debut in March and will now focus on her new career path.

The passengers, including the first Nigerian to fly in space, experienced several minutes of weightlessness before the capsule and its reusable booster returned safely to Earth.

          <p>India's annual monsoon rains have covered the entire country nine days ahead of the typical schedule, according to the national weather department. The early arrival of the monsoon, which provides nearly 70% of the country's rainfall, is crucial for accelerating the planting of summer crops like rice, corn, and soybeans. The monsoon is the lifeblood of India's agricultural sector and its nearly $4 trillion economy, as almost half of the nation's farmland is rain-fed. So far this month, rainfall has been 8% above average, with forecasts predicting an above-average season for the second consecutive year.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they cannot regulate their body temperature effectively. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, suggesting instead to check pavement temperature and provide indoor playtime. If a dog shows signs of distress, it should be cooled with water immediately and taken to a vet.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that a deal has been reached for a "group of very wealthy people" to purchase the U.S. operations of TikTok. The popular video app has been under pressure to find a new owner due to U.S. government fears that American user data could be accessed by China, a claim its parent company, ByteDance, denies. Trump stated he would reveal the buyer in about two weeks and suggested that the deal would likely require approval from Chinese President Xi Jinping. The deadline for the sale has been extended multiple times, with the current date set for September 17.</p>

Analysts believe this could disrupt the market by providing developers with a powerful, low-cost alternative, potentially accelerating AI application development worldwide. The move also raises questions about market trust and security, as enterprises may be skeptical of adopting a Chinese-developed open-source model. (not investment advice)</p>
