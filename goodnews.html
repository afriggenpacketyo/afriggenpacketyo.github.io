          <p>Ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, many mothers are still grappling with the severe consequences for their children, who were born with congenital Zika syndrome. The article highlights a community of mothers in Maceió who have formed a support network to navigate the challenges of raising children with conditions like microcephaly, who often cannot walk, talk, or eat on their own. Despite being largely forgotten by the public, these families recently achieved a significant victory when Brazil's Congress overturned a presidential veto to approve increased long-term financial compensation for their children's care.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough's latest BBC One series, titled "Parenthood," delves into the extraordinary lengths animal parents go to raise their young. The series showcases diverse and dramatic examples, from orangutans teaching their offspring for a decade to poison dart frogs carrying tadpoles up massive trees for safety. A particularly striking sequence features African social spiders, where the mother makes the ultimate sacrifice by allowing her spiderlings to consume her. Director Jeff Wilson notes the show explores relatable parental dilemmas and the challenges of adapting to a changing world, all narrated by the 99-year-old Attenborough.</p>

          <p>Over two decades after its release, the film "Bend It Like Beckham" continues to be celebrated for its significant cultural impact, particularly among South Asian women who saw their experiences reflected on screen. The movie, which follows a Punjabi girl's dream to play soccer against her parents' wishes, made many young women feel seen and heard. As a sequel is reportedly in development, the article explores the film's legacy, noting how it inspired some to pursue sports while also highlighting the real-world barriers that still exist. The film is remembered not just for its sports theme but for its positive representation and message of pursuing one's goals.</p>

          <p>A minor earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 3.0 was reported in Bergen County, New Jersey, on Saturday night, with tremors felt across parts of the Tri-State area. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) centered the earthquake about six miles below ground near Hasbrouck Heights. Shaking was reportedly felt as far as 60 miles away, including in New York City, but there have been no immediate reports of damage or injuries. This event follows other small quakes in the region, including a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Readington Township last year.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a sophisticated electronic warfare technique using a swarm of drones to create a protective "storm eye." This system can simultaneously jam enemy communications while creating a null zone where friendly signals are shielded from interference. By precisely adjusting signal properties, the drones can reportedly reduce electromagnetic interference on an allied user to zero, even in a high-interference environment. This targeted approach marks a significant advancement from traditional brute-force jamming, which disrupts all signals, including those of allies, within its range.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and mother of two young children, has been released after being held in ICE detention for two months. Clouatre was detained in May during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, a result of an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her husband Adrian, who served five years as an intelligence analyst, described feeling betrayed by the arrest of his wife, who was breastfeeding their infant at the time. Her release follows advocacy from her attorney and the office of Senator John Kennedy, though she still faces further immigration proceedings.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has evolved from a niche experiment into a foundational technology for global finance, now valued at over $420 billion. Originally conceived as a platform for "programmable money," it now underpins decentralized finance, NFTs, and trillions of dollars in stablecoin payments. Major financial institutions like Deutsche Bank and BlackRock are increasingly building on Ethereum's infrastructure, valuing its stability and programmability. Co-founder Vitalik Buterin reflects on the platform's staggering growth while cautioning against the risks of centralization as mainstream adoption continues to accelerate.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently lacks a name. The founders want their supporters, who reportedly number over 600,000, to help choose a title that encapsulates the party's essence. The article discusses the complexities of political branding, noting that a name must be registered with the Electoral Commission and should be modern, resonant, and clear. While names like "The Left" have been suggested, the process highlights the challenge of creating a new political identity in a digital age where brand recognition is crucial.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Dončić as their franchise cornerstone, signing him to a three-year, $165-million contract extension. The team's public display of support for the 26-year-old star, including personal recruitment of players by Dončić himself, signals a clear shift in leadership. This move intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season and has historically held significant influence over his teams. While the Lakers front office expressed positive dialogue with James's camp, his long-term role with the team remains undefined.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for his decision to leave medicine and pursue a career in entertainment.

Fearing he would end up like his stepfather, who died before getting to enjoy retirement, he decided to take a year off to try comedy in the early 1990s.
