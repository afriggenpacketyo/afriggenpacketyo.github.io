          <p>Boeing's airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions, according to CEO Kelly Ortberg. Despite ongoing tit-for-tat tariffs, Ortberg said the company is managing the impact and expects to increase Max production. Boeing has been paying tariffs on imported components from Italy and Japan for its wide-body Dreamliner planes, which are made in South Carolina, Ortberg said, adding that much of it can be recouped when the planes are exported again.</p>
