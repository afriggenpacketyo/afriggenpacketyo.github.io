          <p>An American Airlines flight bound for Miami was evacuated on the runway at Denver International Airport following a "possible landing gear incident" during takeoff on Saturday afternoon. All 173 passengers and six crew members aboard the Boeing 737 MAX 8 were safely deplaned, with only one person requiring transport for a minor injury. American Airlines later clarified the aircraft experienced a maintenance issue involving a tire, prompting its removal from service for a thorough inspection by their team. The incident caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays, but airport operations have since returned to normal.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Henry J. Carlin, who was killed in a 1943 plane crash in Burma, have been identified nearly 80 years later, bringing long-awaited closure to his family. His B-25C bomber went down during a raid, and his remains were buried unidentified in a common grave before being recovered in 1947. In 2022, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency exhumed the remains and used dental, anthropological, and mitochondrial DNA analysis to confirm the identification. He is now scheduled for a full military honors burial at Arlington National Cemetery in May 2026.</p>

          <h2>The Science Behind Why Major Sporting Events Like the Euro 2025 Final Affect Fans Physically</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, this article explores the physiological reasons behind the intense reactions to watching football. Psychologists explain that stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline spike on match days, leading to increased heart rates and a "fight or flight" response during crucial moments like penalty shootouts. These hormonal changes can affect sleep, appetite, and even spending habits after a match. Experts advise managing the stress by getting rest, planning the day, and reframing the nervous energy as part of an enjoyable, collective experience that gives people license to express emotion.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in over two decades, with average July temperatures running about one degree below normal in the downtown area. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings deep, cold ocean water to the surface and cools the air. While the Bay Area remains gray and drizzly, other parts of California have faced extreme heat. The article notes that while many residents are enjoying the temperate weather, the region's hottest months are often still to come in September and October.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to protect pubs and music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments built nearby. Under the planned reforms, developers would be responsible for soundproofing new buildings, an effort to prevent the closure of established cultural hubs due to complaints from new residents. The plan also seeks to fast-track permissions for new businesses and expanded outdoor areas to help revitalize struggling town centers and promote al fresco dining. While the government touts the changes as a boost for hospitality, the opposition argues other policies have already harmed the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi completed a two-day visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic ties with the strategically located island nation. The visit comes after the Maldives' new president, Mohamed Muizzu, who was elected on a pro-China platform, had previously demanded the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. Amid economic struggles in the Maldives, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The visit signals a potential warming of relations, which is geopolitically significant due to the Maldives' key position in Indian Ocean shipping lanes.</p>

Speaking to the BBC in Basel, Chadha said the recent success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the original film in 2027 made it the right time to revisit the characters. The original movie, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female footballers. Chadha is unsure if the new installment will be a film or a TV series but hopes to reunite the original cast for the project.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of two distinctive, castle-like structures standing in the Mississippi River near St. Louis's Chain of Rocks Bridge. These are the St. Louis Water Intake Towers, built in 1894 and 1915, which were once vital components of the city's innovative water purification system. Designed in ornate architectural styles, the towers drew river water into underground tunnels for processing before it reached city taps, representing a major public health advancement. Though now decommissioned and designated as city landmarks, they continue to captivate travelers as monuments to St. Louis's early engineering legacy.</p>
