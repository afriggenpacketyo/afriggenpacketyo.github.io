          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government considered reimagining India as a centralized state governed by command and control. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, top bureaucrats and party loyalists pushed for a presidential system to centralize executive power and sideline the judiciary. The ideas never fully materialized, but the Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. This period reflects a clear ambition to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy.</p>
