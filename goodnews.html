          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, have announced a $2 billion donation to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. This contribution is reported to be the single largest donation ever made to a U.S. university or health institution. The funds are intended to advance a revolutionary approach to cancer research, diagnosis, and treatment led by Dr. Brian Druker. This monumental gift continues the Knights' long history of major philanthropy, building on a previous challenge where they matched $500 million in fundraising for the same institute a decade ago.</p>

She will be guided on the treacherous weeklong hike by her two closest friends, with whom she co-founded a nonprofit to educate sighted individuals on how to assist and partner with blind people.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:38:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Software company Palantir has experienced a dramatic surge since its 2020 public debut, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its market valuation soaring past $430 billion. A key driver of this growth has been its government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. The company's AI-powered tools have also attracted significant interest from retail investors, contributing to a stock price that gives it a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. This indicates investors are paying a substantial premium based on high expectations for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Boys Surpassed Girls in Top A-Level Grades This Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:33:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys in the U.K. have achieved a higher percentage of top A-level grades (A* or A) than girls, reversing a consistent trend. The data shows boys secured 28.4% of top grades compared to 28.2% for girls, a narrow but significant shift. Analysts suggest a primary factor is the sustained growth in the popularity of STEM subjects like mathematics, which are disproportionately taken by male students and tend to award a higher percentage of top grades. While more girls take A-levels overall, the increasing gender divide in subject choice appears to have influenced this year's top-level results.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a school pupil from Glasgow, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless people stay warm. She conceived the idea at age 12, and it was later developed into a working prototype by engineering firm Thales, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland. As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Young was also depicted as a Lego mini-figure for a digital cover of the magazine. She expressed shock and honor at the recognition, encouraging other young people with ideas to pursue them through school clubs.</p>

          <p>This article from The Atlantic's archives delves into the historical transformation of the word "genius." Originally referring to a person's unique inner spirit or guiding daemon, the concept shifted in the 19th century towards denoting an individual with extraordinary, almost magical, inherited abilities. This change was influenced by the work of figures like Francis Galton, whose study of "Hereditary Genius" led to the development of eugenics, a dark chapter in the quest to understand exceptionalism. The essay concludes by reflecting on the modern understanding that genius is a complex mix of heritable traits, hard work, and the significant role of luck and historical context.</p>

          <p>Apple has released iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1, software updates that restore the blood oxygen monitoring feature to Apple Watch models sold in the United States. The functionality had been disabled on new and repaired devices since early 2024 due to a patent infringement lawsuit brought by the company Masimo. With the new update, the feature is accessible again, though the data will now be calculated on the paired iPhone and displayed in the Health app. The restoration of this feature is seen as a positive step for users and could clear the way for future health-monitoring advancements.</p>

          <p>Cadets from the U.S. Military Academy's graduating class of 2025 have honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Wang, who dreamed of attending West Point and died while holding a door open for others to escape, had been posthumously accepted into the class. After his name was repeatedly nominated by classmates, the class leadership ensured he was recognized as an Honorary Graduate, with a certificate being mailed to his parents. The act serves as a poignant tribute to Wang's heroism and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece champions a new climate report from the Department of Energy for taking what the author describes as a revolutionary middle-ground position. The report, produced by a small group of independent scientists, affirms that human activity contributes to warming but concludes that it is not necessarily an impending catastrophe and that extreme weather events have not demonstrably increased in frequency or intensity. The author argues this nuanced perspective is a welcome alternative to polarized narratives of either denial or alarmism. The article praises the effort to inject more open debate into climate science and policy.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Debt Forgiveness and Debt Management as Financial Relief Options</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:03:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For consumers struggling with debt amid high interest rates, this article examines two primary relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed, which can save money but severely damages credit scores and may create a tax liability. Debt management, facilitated by credit counseling agencies, focuses on creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, which preserves credit but requires repaying the debt in full. The better choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The two leading plant-based meat companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, are pursuing different strategies to navigate a stagnant market and address consumer criticism. Beyond Meat is pivoting towards simpler, "cleaner" ingredients and more neutral-flavored products, even rebranding to just "Beyond" to move away from direct meat mimicry. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on creating the most meat-like experience possible, launching more indulgent products and sticking with its genetically engineered heme ingredient. These divergent bets on whether health-consciousness or taste is the key driver will shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has reversed its decision to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots following a public outcry and criticism from funeral directors who labeled it a "fat tax." The plan would have imposed a 20% surcharge for a 6-foot-wide plot compared to a standard 5-foot one, a move the council initially defended by citing increased demand and higher obesity rates. After a BBC investigation highlighted residents' concerns about discrimination and fairness, the council announced it would not proceed with the plans. The incident sparked a broader conversation about how local authorities handle burial costs for larger individuals.</p>

          <p>Louis Naidorf, the visionary architect who designed Los Angeles's iconic, circular Capitol Records Building, has died at the age of 96. Hired at a major architectural firm just after graduating, he was entrusted with the secret project at age 24, applying concepts from his master's thesis to create the world's first round office building. Though best known for that 1956 landmark, his extensive body of work also includes the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, the Beverly Hilton hotel, and Phoenix's Chase Tower. Remembered for his humility and dedication to mentoring, Naidorf later became a dean at Woodbury University's School of Architecture.</p>

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has reiterated the insurer's strong commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite growing political pushback in the U.S. and U.K. Speaking after the company reported a 22% jump in operating profit and a rising share price, Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is a practical business necessity for an insurer that covers properties affected by increasingly frequent extreme weather events. The statement comes as some major U.S. and U.K. banks have recently withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, highlighting a growing schism in the financial industry over green commitments.</p>
