          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, contends that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer viable for long-term retirement planning due to increasing longevity. Edelman suggests that investors need a higher allocation to equities, recommending 70% to 80% to ensure sufficient funds for a longer lifespan. He emphasizes that breakthroughs in health and science are expected to extend human lifespans, making it crucial to plan for living to 100 or beyond. The article highlights the rising costs of healthcare and the need for substantial retirement savings to support an extended life.</p>

          <p>The Camogie Association is facing mounting pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts for players, with critics labeling the enforcement as 'sexism.' County and club teams are urging the association to allow women and girls the choice between skorts and shorts in matches. A recent survey indicated that 70% of players experience discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% prefer the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, highlighting the ongoing debate about player comfort and gender equality in sports.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, stating that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained by ICE agents and held in Louisiana. Her lawyers argued that she was detained in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel, protected by the First Amendment.

          <p>President Trump intends to sign an executive order to discourage criminal enforcement of regulatory offenses, aiming to reduce the burden on small businesses. The order will require agencies to publicly list regulatory violations that could lead to criminal charges and provide guidance on prosecution. Prosecutors will be discouraged from filing charges not on the lists or those that don't require proof of criminal intent. The order will not apply to immigration or national security, but seeks to ease compliance burdens for small businesses.</p>

Kratos is targeting a unit price below $5 million for each drone, with a focus on stealth and interactive collaboration. The designs cater to the European market's demand for sensor and weapons capabilities without the long endurance needed for the Pacific.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Combining Social Security benefits with annuity payments can create a stable retirement income stream, but careful planning is essential to maximize benefits. One strategy is to delay claiming Social Security until age 70 to increase monthly payments. Another approach involves laddering annuities for flexibility and hedging against inflation. Managing annuity income withdrawals to stay below taxable income thresholds can also reduce the taxation of Social Security benefits. Consulting a retirement income specialist is recommended to develop a personalized strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) becoming a popular financing option, homeowners need effective payoff strategies. One approach is to take advantage of the interest-only payment period by making larger payments, especially when interest rates are lower. Monitoring the interest rate climate is crucial for adjusting payment strategies, and using the HELOC for select home repairs and renovations can provide tax deductions. A personalized repayment plan, developed with a lending expert, is essential for managing HELOC debt responsibly.</p>
