          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-related events this month, including a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser and a gala dinner for holders of the $TRUMP token. The latter event will grant access to Trump's inner circle based on the number of tokens held, sparking controversy and accusations of corruption. According to the project's website, the Trump Organization and affiliates control approximately 80% of the $TRUMP token supply. While the contest does not guarantee access to the president, the announcement has significantly increased demand for the token and trading activity, generating substantial fees for insiders.

          <p>Experts predict that CD interest rates will likely either remain stable or decrease in May 2025, depending on the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. Some analysts anticipate preemptive rate drops due to expected future rate cuts by the Fed. If the Fed chooses to lower the federal funds rate, CD interest rates are likely to follow suit, however, some experts suggest that the Fed is likely to keep interest rates frozen in May, given the ongoing economic uncertainty and the focus on further tempering inflation.

          <p>President Xi Jinping's new regional security model aims for China to become a regional security provider while excluding external interference, particularly from the U.S. This model echoes Xi's call for Asians to manage their own security independently and capitalizes on regional doubts about Washington's reliability. However, Beijing faces challenges in projecting itself as a benign security partner due to ongoing territorial disputes and escalating rivalry with the U.S. The new framework aligns with Xi's "Asian Security Concept," emphasizing Asian autonomy in regional affairs.</p>

          <p>Cinco de Mayo is celebrated across the U.S. with music, tacos, and displays of Mexican culture, commemorating the 1862 victory of Mexican troops over French forces at the Battle of Puebla. In the U.S., the day is seen as a celebration of Mexican American culture, dating back to the 1800s in California, and festivities include parades, street food, and folkloric ballet. Latino activists and scholars emphasize the importance of understanding the day's historical significance and its role in preserving Mexican American cultural identity.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offensive depth was exposed in a 4-3 loss to the Atlanta Braves, highlighting a potential roster vulnerability. Despite a late-game rally, the Dodgers were unable to capitalize due to unproductive performances from the bottom half of their batting order. Manager Dave Roberts was limited in his options, forced to rely on right-on-right matchups that proved unsuccessful. While the Dodgers' superstars have heated up, the lack of production from the lower batting order remains a concern, and may be something the Dodgers will have to monitor this year.</p>
