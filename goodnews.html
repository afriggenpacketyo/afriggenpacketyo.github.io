          <p>Samsung Electronics announced its plan to acquire Fl√§ktGroup, a heating and cooling solutions provider, for 1.5 billion euros, aiming to bolster its position in the rapidly growing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) market. This strategic move will enable Samsung to compete more effectively with rivals like LG Electronics, particularly in supplying HVAC solutions to data centers, which are experiencing increased demand due to the proliferation of generative AI and related technologies. Fl√§ktGroup's extensive customer base, including pharmaceutical, biotech, and food and beverage companies, will further strengthen Samsung's market reach, supporting the company's goal to increase HVAC revenue by over 30% in 2025.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a significant development after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. The decision by Judge Michael V. Jesic came after emotional testimony from family members, who spoke of the brothers' rehabilitation and remorse. While the judge acknowledged the heinous nature of the crime, he also recognized the support from corrections officials and the brothers' efforts at self-improvement. The focus now shifts to the state's parole officials, with a hearing scheduled for June 13, and ultimately, Governor Gavin Newsom, who will consider clemency.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adam Schiff is calling for a Department of Defense inspector general inquiry into the Trump administration's potential acceptance of a luxury jet from the Qatari government for use as Air Force One. Schiff, along with other Senate Democrats, expressed concerns about constitutional, legal, and national security implications of the possible gift. The senators raised the possibility that the administration used the DOD to facilitate the transfer, potentially sidestepping congressional oversight and burdening taxpayers with retrofit costs. The letter also requested information on the costs and timeline for retrofitting the plane, as well as potential counterintelligence risks.</p>

          <p>EToro, a stock brokerage platform with a growing crypto presence, has priced its IPO at $52 a share, raising nearly $310 million and valuing the company at about $4.2 billion. The company's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will test the market's appetite for new offerings. In its prospectus, eToro said that BlackRock had expressed interest in buying $100 million in shares at the IPO price. This isn't eToro's first attempt at going public, having previously scrapped a SPAC merger in 2022.</p>

          <p>Lower tariffs on Chinese goods are likely to keep auto-parts exports relatively attractive for American buyers, prompting mainland-based producers to reassess their plans to build production facilities in the US. The US agreed to lower its combined 145 per cent tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30 per cent for 90 days after talks in Geneva on Monday, cooling a stand-off between the world‚Äôs two biggest economies since US President Donald Trump rolled out his so-called reciprocal tariffs on the nation‚Äôs trading partners. Chinese-made EV batteries are now subject to 58.4 per cent US tariffs ‚Äì which comprises the 30 per cent extra levy and the existing duties, down from 173.4 per cent before the Geneva deal.</p>

          <h2>Iran Proposes Joint Nuclear Enrichment Venture with Regional Arab Countries and American Investments</h2>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to Iranian officials. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program while also offering a permanent solution that would allow President Trump to claim a significant diplomatic victory. It is not immediately clear how feasible a regional nuclear venture might be if it involved Iran and two of its biggest rivals, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
