          <p>The UK and EU have reached an agreement addressing various post-Brexit issues, including professional qualification recognition, passport control procedures, pet travel, agricultural regulations, and musician touring. While the deal establishes dedicated dialogues for recognizing professional qualifications, a full agreement could take time. UK citizens will eventually be able to use EU e-gates, but not in time for this summer. The agreement also aims to simplify pet travel and removes veterinary checks for British farmers, who must align with EU food standards. British musicians will continue to face red tape when touring Europe, though efforts to support cultural exchange are ongoing. The agreement is expected to affect the UK's ability to boost trade around the world.</p>

          <p>Norwegian energy company Equinor can resume construction on its offshore wind farm in New York after the Trump administration lifted a previous stop-work order.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the decision to allow the project to move forward came after discussions with Equinor and White House officials.

          <p>The gold-silver ratio is a metric that compares the price of gold to the price of silver, indicating how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold. Investors use this ratio to assess whether silver is relatively cheap or expensive compared to gold, informing decisions on whether to favor silver or gold investments. Currently, the gold-silver ratio is high, suggesting silver may be undervalued. While silver is more cost-effective, it tends to be more volatile than gold, with experts offering differing perspectives on whether the ratio will revert to its historical average.

This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to raise prices to cover tariff costs.

          <p>Cadillac's expanding EV lineup is attracting new customers, including a growing number of Tesla owners trading in their vehicles. Nearly 80% of Cadillac EV buyers are new to the brand, with about 10% trading in Teslas. Roughly 25% of customers trading in a Tesla this year are opting for a Cadillac Lyriq SUV, up from previous levels.

          <p>Senior government officials are discussing whether to reverse the decision to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year, affecting over nine million pensioners. Discussions include changing the income threshold or restoring payments to all pensioners, with an announcement potentially coming during the spending review on June 11. Some Labour MPs have blamed the policy for recent election losses, highlighting the political impact of the cuts.</p>
