          <p>The article examines the evolution of Newcastle United since its controversial, Saudi-led takeover four years ago, noting a significant but gradual transformation. While the club has modernized its training facilities and achieved on-field success, including winning the Carabao Cup and qualifying for the Champions League, it has not simply bought its way to the top. Financial regulations like Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR) have constrained spending, forcing a more strategic approach to player development and signings. Despite off-field growth, the club still faces challenges in competing commercially with top rivals.</p>

          <p>Beijing is adopting a new public diplomacy strategy in Africa by sponsoring local social media influencers to visit China and create positive content for younger audiences. For the second year, the Chinese embassy in Kenya has funded a trip for popular Kenyan influencers to tour provinces like Hunan, showcasing China's culture, scenery, and history. This "soft power" campaign aims to connect directly with Gen Z and Millennial Africans, moving beyond traditional state-led media narratives. Experts view this as a significant and potentially more impactful shift in China's efforts to build its brand on the continent.</p>

          <p>Music legend Lionel Richie reveals in his new memoir, "Truly," that he was training to become an Episcopal priest before his music career took off. The 76-year-old artist explained that as a shy young man, he considered the clergy a viable path until a pivotal moment while performing with his college band, The Commodores. An enthusiastic comment from a woman in the audience—"Sing it, baby!"—gave him the validation he needed to pursue music instead. Richie credits this moment for helping him overcome his stage fright and discover his identity as a singer.</p>

          <p>The German government has approved a "Modernization Agenda" aimed at integrating artificial intelligence into public administration to enhance efficiency and reduce bureaucracy. Key initiatives include using AI to expedite visa processing, creating an online platform for export businesses, and developing a digital avatar of a state minister to communicate in 100 languages. While officials emphasize that AI is crucial for future growth, some experts express concern. Critics question the reliance on US tech giants and stress the need for ethical oversight and German technological independence.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland without the governor's consent. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump nominee, ruled that the administration's justification for the deployment did not meet the high legal standard required, stating that protests in the city were not disruptive enough to warrant such an action. The judge's decision, which blocks the deployment for 14 days, emphasized the nation's tradition of separating military from civil affairs. Oregon officials praised the ruling as a victory for state sovereignty.</p>
