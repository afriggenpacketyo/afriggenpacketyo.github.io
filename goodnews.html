          <h2>Tesla Sales in Norway Surge Despite Broader European Backlash Against Elon Musk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 03:55:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's new car sales in Norway saw a significant 54% year-on-year increase in June, a stark contrast to declining sales in other major European markets like Germany. This surge is largely attributed to the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which offers features well-suited to Norwegian consumer needs, such as large luggage space and all-wheel drive. Despite the sales success, a recent survey indicates that 43% of Norwegian EV drivers would not buy a Tesla for political reasons related to CEO Elon Musk's public rhetoric, showing a complex consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>The UK government will not proceed with immediate changes to the £20,000 tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), according to BBC sources.

          <p>Dallas Mavericks' number one draft pick, Cooper Flagg, made his NBA Summer League debut, finishing with 10 points, six rebounds, and four assists in an 87-85 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite a challenging shooting night, going 5-for-21 from the floor, the 18-year-old showcased his potential with several key plays, including a dunk off a steal. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd praised Flagg's poise and decision-making during the highly anticipated game, which also featured a defensive matchup against Lakers guard Bronny James.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has stated that the new "one in, one out" migrant returns agreement with France is robust enough to withstand legal challenges. The pilot scheme will see the UK return migrants who arrive in small boats to France, and for each person returned, Britain will accept a refugee who has made a legal claim in France. Cooper confirmed she has been in close contact with supportive EU governments about the deal, which aims to deter illegal crossings. The plan will initially involve around 50 people per week, with a focus on targeting illegal work as a pull factor.</p>

The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species in what is considered their last refuge in the river's upper reaches. For decades, the dense network of dams has blocked water flow, restricted fish migration routes, and degraded the ecosystem. This large-scale removal project is intended to reverse the damage and improve the ecological health of the vital waterway.</p>
