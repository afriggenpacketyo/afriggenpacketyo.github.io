          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen emphasize that the U.S. Constitution was intentionally designed as a work in progress, meant to be amended and adapted by future generations. The document's creation involved significant compromises, particularly regarding slavery, and its initial ratification was contingent on the addition of the Bill of Rights. Experts argue that the founders expected constant revision and that modern political gridlock, where Congress has ceased to check presidential power and courts have become overly powerful, is contrary to the original intent. The Constitution's endurance relies on the nation's ability to engage in deliberation and uphold its foundational principles of a government of laws, not of kings.</p>

          <p>Europe's Ryder Cup team is employing an unconventional training method to prepare for the hostile environment expected at Bethpage, New York: virtual reality headsets that shout abuse. Captain Luke Donald introduced the technology to help players desensitize themselves to the name-calling and intense pressure from American crowds. Star player Rory McIlroy confirmed he used the simulation, noting that he encouraged the programmers to 'go as far as you want' with the insults to make it realistic. This innovative approach underscores the team's detailed preparations as they aim to secure a rare victory on U.S. soil.</p>

          <p>As the 2025 WNBA playoffs begin, experts are weighing in on the key storylines and potential outcomes, with many predicting a championship victory for the Minnesota Lynx. The team is said to be on a 'revenge tour' after a controversial loss in the 2024 finals, boasting the league's top defense and elite shooting. Led by MVP candidate Napheesa Collier, the Lynx are seen as the team to beat, though the Las Vegas Aces, on a 16-game winning streak, present a formidable challenge. The absence of rookies Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese from the postseason is noted as both a loss for rivalry narratives and a chance for other league stars to shine.</p>

Broadcom's stock surged after it reported strong earnings and secured a new $10 billion AI-related customer, believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is seeing high demand for its AI security solutions, while Oracle's stock spiked due to massive growth in its cloud infrastructure contracts, driven by AI workload demands. Analysts have raised their price targets for all three companies, citing their robust growth profiles and strategic positioning. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This archival article revisits the case of Amanda Knox, an American student who was convicted and later exonerated for the 2007 murder of her roommate, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia, Italy. The story details the intense media frenzy, a controversial 14-hour police interrogation that led to a coerced confession, and the subsequent investigation that focused on Knox and her boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The case was marked by questionable evidence and a shifting police theory, especially after another individual, Rudy Guede, was linked to the scene by DNA. Knox and Sollecito spent nearly four years in prison before their convictions were ultimately overturned on appeal.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: What UK's Labour Party Can Learn from a Progressive Campaign's Success in New York</h2>

          <p>As the UK Labour party's popularity declines, this analysis explores lessons from the successful mayoral primary campaign of Zohran Mamdani in New York. Mamdani's success is attributed to a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, proposing clear, compelling policies such as free bus transport and a rent freeze. He also crafted a powerful overarching narrative that positioned him as an agent of change against a broken system. The article suggests that Labour, by contrast, has lacked a consistent vision and has been hesitant to champion its own popular policies, failing to connect with voters as effectively as insurgents on both the left and right.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, doctors in Kyiv performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl during one of the most severe Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team from the Kyiv Heart Institute drove through explosions to retrieve a donor heart from a deceased 4-year-old at another hospital. They then successfully completed the complex surgery on Kira Skliarova, whose own heart was failing, while the hospital building shook from nearby blasts. The story highlights the resilience and dedication of Ukrainian medical professionals working to save lives amidst the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on identifying potential door-to-door scams, prompted by a reader's unsettling encounter with a man offering lawn-mowing services who became aggressive when refused. Warning signs of a scam include demands for upfront payment, high-pressure tactics, cash-only payments, and a lack of proper identification or written contracts. To protect themselves, consumers are advised not to let strangers into their homes, to research any company thoroughly, and to be wary of offers that seem too good to be true. If victimized, individuals should document the incident, contact law enforcement, and inform their state's consumer affairs division.</p>

          <h2>Advice Column: Overcoming Moral Scrupulosity and the Pressure to Be Perfect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This advice column addresses a reader struggling with scrupulosity—an obsessive worry about one's own morality—which becomes particularly acute during religious holidays like Yom Kippur. The author advises moving away from a mindset of moral optimization, which is paralyzing and unrealistic for imperfect humans, towards a more compassionate approach of simply trying to live in line with one's values. Drawing on rabbinic stories, the column suggests viewing moral failings not as sins but as 'missing the mark,' which allows for self-compassion and genuine growth. This shift in perspective can help transform days of reflection from triggers for guilt into opportunities for self-acceptance.</p>
