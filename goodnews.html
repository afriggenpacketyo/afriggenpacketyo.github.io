          <p>A comprehensive study by CNBC has ranked the top ten U.S. states for quality of life, with Vermont securing the top spot for the fifth consecutive year. The methodology considers factors like crime rates, healthcare access, environmental quality, and legal protections for residents, including reproductive rights. Other high-ranking states include Maine, New Jersey, and Minnesota, each praised for strengths such as low crime, strong health systems, or inclusive laws. The report highlights how quality of life has become a crucial economic factor for states aiming to attract a mobile workforce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value soared past $120,000, setting a new all-time high driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and anticipation of favorable U.S. regulations. Lawmakers are currently deliberating a series of bills, dubbed "Crypto Week," aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, a move supported by the Trump administration. Analysts suggest that increased institutional buying is a primary factor in the rally, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future. However, potential U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes remain a risk to this upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has proposed current Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko to be the country's next prime minister, part of a broader cabinet renewal amid the ongoing war with Russia. Svyrydenko, 39, has been credited with successfully negotiating a key mineral deal with the United States and has risen quickly through government ranks. If approved by parliament, she would replace the incumbent Denys Shmyhal and become Ukraine's second female prime minister. The move reflects Zelenskyy's effort to strengthen his government's leadership during a critical phase of the conflict.</p>

          <p>A man was arrested at Atlanta's international airport for allegedly attempting to transport drugs with an estimated street value of nearly $3 million to Brazil. The suspect, Vance Ray Randolph, was found with a suitcase containing significant quantities of THC wax, hashish, and marijuana. The seizure was made on June 28, with the Atlanta Police Department releasing details and body camera footage of the incident. Randolph was subsequently transported to the Clayton County Jail to face narcotics charges in connection with the attempted international smuggling operation.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has minimized U.S. fears that his company's advanced AI chips could be used by the Chinese military, arguing that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any time. In a recent interview, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, stating they are counterproductive to establishing American technology as the global standard, especially since half of the world's AI developers are in China. His comments come as he navigates a difficult path between Washington's national security policies and maintaining access to the crucial Chinese market.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of female senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address the higher risk of injury and death for women in car crashes. The bill would require federal safety tests to use advanced dummies that better represent the female anatomy, as current tests primarily use a model based on an average-sized male from the 1990s. Government data shows women are 73% more likely to suffer serious injuries in a crash. Supporters argue that more diverse testing is crucial for gathering data to design safer vehicles for all drivers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts at Citi have upgraded their outlook on the industrial company Dover, naming it a "Top Pick" and raising their price target to $226, citing underappreciated growth potential. The endorsement highlights the strength of Dover's niche businesses, such as biopharma and heat exchangers, which are showing signs of increased demand. Despite this positive call, the stock faced downward pressure, potentially due to President Trump's recent threats of new tariffs against the EU, a region where Dover has a significant cost base. The article suggests the company has tools to mitigate potential tariff impacts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers interest rate cuts later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to best utilize Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Some analysts suggest that with rates likely to fall, locking in a longer-term CD now could secure a higher yield for an extended period. Others argue that short-term CDs currently offer more competitive rates and flexibility. A popular strategy to balance these factors is "CD laddering," which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms to mitigate interest rate risk while ensuring regular access to funds.

          <p>The U.S. plan to send Patriot missile systems to Ukraine aims to bolster the country's defense against Russian aerial attacks. The Patriot is a highly advanced, mobile surface-to-air missile (SAM) system capable of intercepting tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft at a range of over 40 miles. The system, which costs over $1 billion per battery and requires around 90 troops to operate, represents a significant upgrade to Ukraine's air defense capabilities.

          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture between General Motors and LG Energy Solution, will upgrade its Tennessee plant to manufacture lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells for electric vehicles. These LFP batteries are significantly cheaper to produce because they do not require expensive minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are used in conventional lithium-ion cells. The move is part of GM's strategy to diversify its EV portfolio and make electric vehicles more affordable for a wider range of consumers. Production of the new LFP cells is expected to commence by late 2027.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's social media post considering the revocation of Rosie O'Donnell's U.S. citizenship, legal experts have widely dismissed the threat as unconstitutional.

The feud between Trump and O'Donnell, who recently moved to Ireland, has spanned nearly two decades. While denaturalization can occur in cases of fraud, it is not applicable to native-born citizens who have not voluntarily renounced their status.</p>
