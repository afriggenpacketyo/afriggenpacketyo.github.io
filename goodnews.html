          <p>Chinese government scientists conducted a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, using cloud-seeding drones to increase rainfall by over 4% across 8,000 sq km. The project, led by Li Bin, generated 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. The findings, published in Desert and Oasis Meteorology, highlight China's ongoing efforts in weather modification technology.</p>

          <p>Romania held a re-run of its presidential election after the original November vote was annulled due to irregularities and alleged Russian interference. The annulled vote saw Calin Georgescu, a far-right, pro-Russian candidate, surprisingly win the first round, but he was later banned from running again. George Simion, an ally of Georgescu, is expected to progress to a second-round run-off, while pro-EU candidates like Nicusor Dan and Crin Antonescu are also competing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent panic over baby food pouches, deemed ultra-processed foods (UPFs), is seen as another way to make mothers feel guilty, according to Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett. While acknowledging concerns about sugar content and nutritional value, Cosslett argues that this criticism is part of a larger trend of shaming mothers for seeking convenience and not adhering to traditional domestic roles. She asserts that societal factors like lack of time, resources, and support systems are often ignored in the UPF debate, placing undue pressure on mothers to cook everything from scratch.</p>
