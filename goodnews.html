          <p>California is attempting to alleviate its long-standing housing crisis through significant new legislative reforms. The state has been plagued by a severe shortage of affordable housing, leading to some of the highest living costs in the nation. One recent bill, SB 79, faced public debate but was ultimately signed into law as part of a broader strategy to increase housing supply. These reforms represent a contentious but determined effort by state lawmakers, including Governor Gavin Newsom, to tackle the complex issues that have hindered residential development and exacerbated homelessness across the state.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, upholding the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to pay the damages for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. His legal team argued for First Amendment protections and claimed the financial penalty was excessive, but the court declined to hear the case without comment. Lawyers for the Sandy Hook families stated they will now proceed with enforcing the verdict, ensuring Jones and his company, Infowars, are held accountable for the harm caused by their misinformation.</p>

The investment bank's earnings per share also rose significantly by 45.8% to $12.25, driven by a strong performance in its global banking and markets division. CEO David Solomon expressed optimism about the M&A and IPO landscape, citing a more supportive regulatory environment. Despite initial profit-taking in the market, the robust fundamentals have reinforced confidence in the firm's outlook heading into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that the central bank is approaching the end of its quantitative tightening program, which involves reducing its large holdings of government bonds. In a speech, Powell stated that the Fed's goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for the banking system may be reached in the coming months. He gave no new guidance on the future direction of interest rates, reiterating that policymakers are navigating the tension between employment and inflation goals. The comments suggest a shift in one aspect of monetary policy as the Fed continues to analyze economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has seized approximately $15 billion in bitcoin, marking the largest forfeiture in its history. The cryptocurrency was linked to Chen Zhi, the alleged leader of a massive "pig butchering" investment fraud operation based in Cambodia that used forced labor. Prosecutors say Zhi's organization, Prince Holding Group, ran scam compounds where trafficked individuals were forced to defraud victims worldwide out of billions of dollars. The indictment accuses Zhi, who remains at large, of directing one of history's largest investment scams and using bribery to protect his criminal enterprise.</p>

          <p>With silver prices reaching nearly $50 per ounce, investors are focused on the liquidity of their holdings. According to market analysis, the easiest silver investments to sell quickly are those with universal recognition and high demand from dealers. Government-minted coins like American Silver Eagles and Canadian Maple Leafs are top-tier for liquidity due to their guaranteed purity and sovereign backing. Reputable silver bars, silver-backed ETFs, and pre-1965 U.S. "junk silver" coins are also highly liquid, allowing investors to capitalize on market peaks without significant delays or verification issues.

          <p>Cody Balmer, the man who set fire to the Pennsylvania governor's mansion while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside, has been sentenced to 25 to 50 years in prison. Balmer pleaded guilty to attempted murder, terrorism, and arson for the April attack, which caused millions in damages. He used gasoline-filled beer bottles to ignite the residence just hours after the family had celebrated Passover. Governor Shapiro commented that the sentence represents "real accountability" and stressed the importance of not accepting acts of political violence as normal in the United States.</p>

          <p>As Southern California faces what is being called the strongest October storm in years, officials are urging drivers to exercise extreme caution on the roads. Key safety tips include slowing down, turning on headlights whenever windshield wipers are in use, and maintaining extra distance between vehicles to account for longer stopping times on wet pavement. Drivers are strongly advised never to enter flooded streets, as even six inches of water can stall a car and deeper water can sweep a vehicle away. The storm is expected to bring potential flooding and mudslides to the region.</p>

The update will also prevent teens from following accounts that regularly post inappropriate material and limit their interactions with such content. This move is part of a broader effort by the social media giant to address concerns from parents and regulators about protecting young users online.</p>

          <p>Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne is enjoying an exceptional start to the season at Napoli, prompting questions about whether his former club, Manchester City, let him leave prematurely. The 34-year-old veteran joined the Italian club on a free transfer after his contract with City expired, part of a recent exodus of senior players from the English side. Despite his age, De Bruyne's current form, marked by a high number of goals and assists, suggests he could still be a key contributor at the highest level. His performance stands out when compared to many of Manchester City's current midfielders.</p>
