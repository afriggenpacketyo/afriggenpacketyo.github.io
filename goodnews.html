          <h2>FDA Considers Banning Fluoride Supplements for Children Amidst Health Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:45:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering banning fluoride supplements for children due to potential health risks, including concerns about the gut microbiome and IQ. This move coincides with several states restricting fluoride in public water supplies. Experts are divided, with some questioning the strength of the evidence supporting the ban, while others emphasize the benefits of fluoride in preventing cavities, especially for children without access to fluoridated water. The FDA will review the safety of ingestible fluoride products for children by October 31. Dentists recommend fluoride supplements for children who live in areas without fluoridated water or who are at high risk of developing cavities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to address overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales, the government will implement limits on how long some offenders can be returned to prison for breaching their licenses. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced that offenders recalled to prison for license breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period. This measure aims to free up around 1,400 prison places, providing time to overhaul the system, with the government planning to start work on three new prisons this year, funded by a ¬£4.7 billion investment. These changes will not apply to offenders who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a freeze on new enrollment of undocumented adult immigrants in the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, beginning no sooner than January 1, 2026. Additionally, he is proposing a $100 monthly premium for Medi-Cal enrollees aged 19 and up with "unsatisfactory immigration status," effective January 1, 2027. Newsom's office attributes these measures partly to the economic impact of Trump's trade policies and higher-than-expected healthcare utilization. While Newsom affirms his commitment to healthcare for all Californians, he emphasizes the need for fiscal stability and preserving Medi-Cal's long-term viability.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is relocating the assembly of the President's Daily Intelligence Brief (PDB) from the CIA headquarters to her own complex. This decision comes as President Trump has questioned the necessity of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Gabbard also ordered the National Intelligence Council to relocate to her headquarters, aiming to strengthen the ODNI's role and oversight. Critics argue this move could reduce the ODNI's effectiveness by separating oversight from the CIA teams responsible for most of the work, potentially leading to inefficiencies and miscommunication.</p>

          <p>Investing $250,000 in an annuity could generate monthly payments ranging from approximately $1,200 to over $2,600, depending on factors such as age, gender, and the contract structure. Payments can vary significantly; for example, a 60-year-old man might receive $1,476 monthly, while a woman of the same age might receive slightly less due to longer life expectancy. Strategies to maximize annuity investments include shopping for the best rates, considering a laddering strategy, assessing health and family history, balancing guaranteed income with flexibility, and understanding tax implications. Carefully evaluating these factors can help individuals make informed decisions to secure stable retirement income (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy defended President Trump's potential acceptance of a jet offered by Qatar, attributing the need for the gift to Boeing's delays in providing a new Air Force One. McCarthy argued that Boeing should lease a plane, even the Qatari jet, to avoid implications of a gift, as the current Air Force One planes are approximately 40 years old. He emphasized Trump's business mindset and desire to avoid taxpayer expenses. Some Republicans have expressed concerns about the Qatari offer, while others have focused on the need for a new, secure Air Force One.</p>

Psychologists suggest comedians like Alan Carr are likely frontrunners due to their adaptability and ability to mask their true intentions, while sports stars may excel as faithfuls due to their teamwork and ability to handle pressure. The show's format involves a group of contestants, known as traitors, picking off their castmates, the faithful, with nightly "murders" - while the faithful try to work out their identity.</p>

The deal, involving 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft powered by GE engines, was finalized during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates the agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million total domestic jobs during the production and delivery of the planes. The agreement could nearly double Qatar Airways' fleet and draw scrutiny toward Trump's acceptance of a gifted luxury jet from Qatar for Air Force One.</p>
