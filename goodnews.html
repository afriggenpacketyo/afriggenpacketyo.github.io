Notable corporate news included Australian rare earths producer Lynas Rare Earths planning a large share sale and Qantas achieving record-high shares due to robust earnings. Meanwhile, India's Nifty 50 fell as new U.S. tariffs on Indian exports raised concerns about the nation's economic growth prospects, adding a layer of uncertainty to regional trade dynamics.

This legislation aims to standardize procurement processes across all government bodies and local authorities, thereby minimizing avenues for abuse of power and non-compliance. It also establishes penalties for illicit practices such as rent-seeking and improper subcontracting. While the Finance Minister asserted the bill limits ministerial authority, civil society organizations and some opposition members voiced concerns regarding potential loopholes and insufficient independent oversight, advocating for further regulatory updates.</p>

          <h2>UK Car Exports to US Increase Following New Tariff Agreement</h2>

          <p>British-made car sales to the United States increased by 6.8% in July, marking a reversal after three months of falling sales, as reported by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. This positive shift is directly linked to the new UK-US tariff deal implemented in late June, which reduced the import tax on British cars to 10% from an initial 25% proposal, applicable to the first 100,000 vehicles. The SMMT underscored the critical role of the US market for UK car exports, even as the broader UK manufacturing sector faces challenges from higher labor costs, global competition, and the effects of Brexit.

          <p>Computer-chip designer Nvidia reported a 56% surge in second-quarter revenue to $46.7 billion, driven by strong demand from tech giants expanding their AI capabilities. Despite navigating "geopolitical issues" and US-China trade tensions, including a ban on high-end chip sales to China, Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang emphasized that the "AI race is now on," with spending from major tech firms doubling. While data center revenue slightly missed analyst expectations, causing a minor dip in after-hours trading, the company remains central to the AI economy. Nvidia is actively lobbying the US government to approve sales of its next-generation Blackwell chips to China, its largest market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The news of Taylor Swift's engagement has sparked intense emotional reactions from fans, illustrating the phenomenon of "parasocial relationships" where individuals feel deeply connected to celebrities they don't personally know. Psychologists describe these as "my friend who doesn't know me," driven by increased access to celebrities' private lives through social media and reality shows. While such one-sided connections can offer a sense of community and help satisfy the human need for connection, particularly during times like the pandemic, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. These relationships are likened to "fast food" – enjoyable but lacking genuine "nutritional content."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small parcels shipped from China to the UK, benefiting from an import tax exemption for goods worth £135 or less, more than doubled last year to £3 billion. This surge is largely attributed to Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. The UK government is currently reviewing these rules, as domestic businesses argue the exemption creates unfair competition and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe products. While the US has ended its similar "de minimis" exemption and the EU plans a flat fee, critics urge swifter action from the UK to protect local retailers and address the "significant and growing threat" to High Street investment.

          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player inadvertently entangled in a brutal crime caper in 1998 New York City. Adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, the movie immerses viewers in a "gritty trifle" of a pre-millennial Lower East Side, filled with colorful characters and escalating violence. Hank, a self-loathing alcoholic, navigates a dangerous underworld involving Russian thugs and Hassidic hitmen, all while being hounded by a persistent NYPD detective. The review praises Aronofsky's affectionate, albeit grimy, portrayal of the city and Butler's performance as a man struggling with his past potential and present failures.</p>

However, it warned that exports could gradually slow due to expanding US tariff impacts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida is now deploying innovative robot rabbits within the Everglades as a new strategy to combat the pervasive invasive Burmese python population, which is severely impacting native wildlife. These solar-powered robotic lures are engineered to mimic real marsh rabbits by emitting heat, a distinctive smell, and natural movements, specifically designed to attract pythons into monitored pens. Each robot costs approximately $4,000, and this initiative aims to significantly enhance python detection, a challenge given their expert camouflage. This effort represents the latest in a series of attempts, including past uses of live rabbit lures, to manage the tens of thousands of pythons established in the delicate subtropical ecosystem.</p>
