        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government began releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower soaring rice prices affecting households. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to start selling the rice at a reduced price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. Consumers quickly flocked to purchase the cheaper rice, with some stores selling out within minutes of opening. The initiative aims to address rising rice prices by making 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022 harvests available to consumers at a lower cost.</p>
