          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta's AI standing, is reportedly investing $14 billion in Scale AI and attempting to recruit CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new AI research lab. Meta aims to bolster its AI capabilities and improve its Llama models, following lukewarm reception from developers. By taking a significant stake in Scale AI rather than acquiring it outright, Meta seeks to avoid antitrust scrutiny. This move underscores the intense competition in the AI sector and Meta's determination to catch up with rivals like OpenAI, reflecting both urgency and strategic maneuvering.</p>
