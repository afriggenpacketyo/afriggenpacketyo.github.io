          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare his party's readiness to supplant Welsh Labour as the governing party in the next Senedd election. In his annual conference speech, he will position Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, promising "new energy and new ideas" for Wales. For the first time in a century, Labour's dominance in Welsh politics appears vulnerable, with recent polls showing Plaid Cymru and Reform UK as significant challengers. Ap Iorwerth aims to frame the election as a choice between his party and Reform UK, urging voters to back Plaid Cymru to prevent a Farage-led victory.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reportedly reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair from eleven to five following a series of in-depth interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is said to be seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and who is willing to review the Fed's structure and mission. The final decision will be made by President Trump, who may nominate the chosen individual as a Fed governor first before elevating them to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

The first phase of the deal involves the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for over a thousand Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. As part of the agreement, increased humanitarian aid is also scheduled to enter the Gaza Strip. The U.S. is establishing a coordination center in Israel with approximately 200 personnel to support and monitor the ceasefire's implementation and aid distribution, though no American troops will enter Gaza.</p>

After the driver, Suzanna, realized she had brought the wrong order, Pastor Neal Seiwert and his family comforted her and prayed for her on their front porch. The moment, captured by a Ring camera, was shared on social media, where it garnered millions of views and an outpouring of support. Seiwert then set up a GoFundMe page to assist Suzanna, which quickly surpassed its initial goal, highlighting a widespread positive reaction to the act of kindness.</p>

          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, will soon alter how high-income workers make catch-up contributions. Starting in 2026, individuals earning more than $145,000 from their employer in the prior year must make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, eliminating the option for a traditional pretax deduction. This shift means higher earners will lose the upfront tax break on these extra savings, though withdrawals in retirement will be tax-free. Financial experts advise that affected workers should consult with advisors now to plan their contribution strategy for the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, a group affiliated with Columbia University, has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian student activists. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of student Mahmoud Khalil and others was unconstitutional and intended to suppress free speech. This ruling highlights a stark contrast between the institute's defiant defense of constitutional principles and Columbia University's more conciliatory approach toward the administration. The case has positioned the Knight Institute at the forefront of legal challenges to the administration's actions regarding campus speech and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>UCLA guard Skyy Clark is dedicating his senior basketball season to his father, Kenny Clark, who passed away in May at age 47 after a long battle with health issues. Kenny, a former professional football player, was Skyy's first coach and biggest inspiration, and their close bond was maintained through almost daily phone calls. Skyy had previously taken a break from his freshman season at Illinois to care for his father, a period he describes as an up-and-down battle. Now at UCLA, he finds motivation in his father's perseverance and says basketball has been an escape for him during a period of off-the-court trauma.</p>

          <p>The Nobel Peace Prize for 2025 has been awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado for her persistent efforts to promote democracy in her country. The Norwegian Nobel Committee praised her as a "brave and committed champion of peace" who has led the struggle against expanding authoritarianism in Venezuela. In its announcement, the committee highlighted the global retreat of democracy and emphasized that democratic rights are the foundation of peace. Machado, an industrial engineer, founded groups to promote free elections and was elected to the National Assembly in 2010 before being expelled by the ruling regime in 2014.</p>

Despite a dominant 20-6 record over the last five weeks, key players like Shohei Ohtani struggled offensively in the division series, and the team's batting average was a modest .199. Catcher Will Smith noted that the team has "another gear," expecting stars like Ohtani to rebound strongly in the next round.

          <p>The appointment of Bari Weiss, founder of The Free Press, as editor in chief of CBS News has sparked widespread debate and analysis across the media landscape. Weiss, who famously resigned from The New York Times citing an "illiberal environment," will now report directly to Paramount chairman David Ellison. This article explores competing theories about the move: one suggests it's a strategic alignment with the Trump administration, while another posits it's a "Reconciliation Gambit" to bring ideological balance back to a legacy media outlet. The author frames her hiring as a significant experiment to see if a prominent heterodox voice can successfully reshape and perhaps save a traditional news organization.</p>

The 62-year-old star, currently a contestant on 'Strictly Come Dancing', underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, which concluded late last year. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after finding blood in her urine. She said the experience motivated her to join the dance competition, embracing the philosophy that "life is too short," and is now urging other women not to ignore potential health warning signs.</p>

After inheriting it, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and forgot it when she moved. The new homeowners, an anthropologist and her husband, recognized its significance, leading to its identification as a missing headstone from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, and initiating its repatriation.</p>

Her suburb has become a focal point due to protests outside an ICE facility, but she describes the community as calm. A federal judge has since issued a temporary restraining order, stating there is "no credible evidence" of a rebellion in Illinois that would warrant such a deployment.</p>
