          <h2>Trump Suggests Tariff Reductions on Chinese Goods Amid Trade Discussions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated the possibility of reducing tariffs on goods from China as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. This meeting is viewed as a crucial step toward de-escalating the trade war that has destabilized financial markets. Trump expressed optimism about the discussions, while China conveyed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. Despite this progress, analysts caution that systemic issues remain, and any tariff cuts are likely to be minor, with lengthy negotiations expected to fully resolve the trade disputes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports rose by 8.1%, while imports saw a slight decrease of 0.2%. Despite the overall export growth, shipments to the U.S. fell by over 21%, and imports from the U.S. also declined by nearly 14%. Analysts suggest that transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs may have contributed to the export surge, but expect trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

The deal also includes a clause allowing the U.S. to object to Chinese firms investing in the UK, sparking debate over potential implications for British sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article explores the impact of the Trump administration's policies on the offshore wind industry, particularly in the U.S. A halt to construction on a wind farm off Long Island has created uncertainty for European companies involved in renewable energy projects. While the industry is counting on Europe to offset the pullback in the U.S., rising costs and regulatory challenges persist, even in Europe. The article highlights the industry's resilience in the face of changing political and economic landscapes, with companies adapting their strategies to mitigate risks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, which could lower the burden of his sweeping tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates.</p>

China's export restrictions on tungsten and other metals have caused panic in the industry, prompting companies to seek alternative sources. US defense contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027, further driving the need for diversification. China accounted for the vast majority of global raw tungsten ore mined last year, highlighting its dominance in the market.</p>
