          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced inflation-adjusted figures for the 2026 tax year, impacting dozens of provisions. The taxable income thresholds for long-term capital gains tax brackets have been increased, allowing more income to be taxed at lower rates. For instance, single filers will qualify for the 0% rate with taxable income up to $49,450. The standard deduction will also rise to $16,100 for single filers and $32,200 for married couples filing jointly, reflecting adjustments for the rising cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has inaugurated a new production complex in Camaçari, Brazil, its largest manufacturing investment outside of Asia. The R$5.5 billion (US$978 million) facility, built on a former Ford site, marks a significant step in the company's expansion into Latin America and aligns with Brazil's push toward clean mobility. The plant will initially produce 150,000 vehicles annually, with plans to double that capacity in a second phase. This move underscores Beijing's growing industrial influence in the region's burgeoning EV market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines reported strong third-quarter results and issued an optimistic forecast for the remainder of the year, surpassing Wall Street expectations. The airline's success is largely attributed to resilient demand for luxury travel, with revenue from premium cabins increasing by 9% to nearly $5.8 billion, nearly eclipsing main cabin sales. The company projects adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter between $1.60 and $1.90 a share, signaling confidence in continued consumer spending on higher-end travel experiences. This positive outlook suggests a recovery in demand and better capacity management across the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Standardized test scores for California students are showing upward trends, though they still lag behind pre-pandemic levels statewide. However, notable districts like Los Angeles Unified and Compton Unified have demonstrated significant gains, with proficiency rates now exceeding their 2018-19 results. In response to ongoing literacy challenges, Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation mandating phonics-based reading instruction. While progress is being made, significant achievement gaps persist among student subgroups, indicating that academic recovery from the pandemic remains an ongoing and uneven process across the state.</p>

          <p>A new book by "Gavin & Stacey" creators Ruth Jones and James Corden, titled "When Gavin Met Stacey," offers fans a glimpse into the making of the beloved British sitcom.

It also discloses that a storyline involving Gavin having an affair was considered and scrapped. The creators also discussed how the 2019 Christmas special came to be and their decision to make the final episode a TV special rather than a film.</p>

          <p>With the announcement of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize imminent, this article explains the history and process behind the prestigious award. Established by Alfred Nobel, the prize honors individuals or organizations for significant contributions to global peace and is decided by a Norwegian committee. While nominations are kept secret for 50 years, President Donald Trump's candidacy has been publicly confirmed by allies following his role in brokering an Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. Past winners include four U.S. presidents, but experts note the committee values durable peace efforts, making a win for Trump's recent achievements uncertain.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was scheduled to be put to death for the 2002 killing of his two-year-old daughter. Roberson has maintained his innocence for 22 years, and his defense argues his conviction was based on a flawed and now-disputed diagnosis of "shaken baby syndrome." The court's decision allows for a re-examination of the case under a Texas law that permits challenges to convictions based on discredited or evolved scientific evidence. This development marks a significant turn in a case that has drawn bipartisan support for review.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that all victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal will be entitled to free legal advice for their compensation claims. This significant change is a response to the public inquiry into the miscarriage of justice, where over 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty accounting software. Previously, many victims, particularly those in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme, had to accept compensation offers without legal counsel, often for far less than they were owed. The new policy aims to ensure victims receive full and fair redress for the financial ruin and personal suffering they endured.</p>

          <p>YouTube is revising its enforcement policies to offer a path for previously terminated creators to return to the platform. Under the new "second chance" program, creators whose channels were banned can apply to start a new one after a one-year waiting period. This marks a significant shift from the platform's previous lifetime ban policy and comes amid scrutiny from politicians over content moderation practices. Approved creators will have to start from scratch, without their previous videos or subscribers, and requests will be reviewed based on the severity of past violations and any off-platform behavior.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This essay explores the concept of "collective illusions," where individuals silently hold opinions they believe are in the minority but are actually widely shared. Drawing parallels to the Soviet Union, the author argues that fear of social rejection causes people to self-silence, creating a false consensus that harms both democracy and personal well-being. The piece references Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance," advocating for individuals to stop feigning agreement, reframe their independence, and quietly disengage from groups that promote views they find incorrect. Doing so can break harmful illusions and lead to a more authentic and happy life.</p>
