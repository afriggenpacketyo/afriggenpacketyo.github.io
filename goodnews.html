          <p>Chinese media reported that President Trump held a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, initiated by Trump himself, according to Beijing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

This call comes amid ongoing trade tensions and negotiations between the United States and China, marking a significant development in the economic and diplomatic relationship. The discussion between the two leaders may pave the way for further talks and potential resolutions to trade disputes. Optimism about the call's positive impact on the trade relationship is reflected in the market's reaction. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in April, coinciding with President Trump's tariff escalations, as imports plunged, according to Commerce Department data. While Trump touts tariffs as a tool to reduce the trade deficit, economists debate their effectiveness, with some arguing it reflects U.S. consumer demand. The future of Trump's tariff policy remains uncertain due to ongoing court rulings and anxious consumers, as consumer sentiment has soured amidst tariff implementation, according to a University of Michigan survey. Despite these anxieties, key economic indicators like unemployment remain strong, and the OECD forecasts continued U.S. economic growth, although at a slower pace. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dilly Dally, an adolescent loggerhead sea turtle, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean after having a front flipper amputated at a Florida turtle hospital. The turtle was rescued in January with predator wounds to its front flipper and underwent rehabilitation at Loggerhead Marinelife Center. A satellite tracking device was attached to Dilly Dally's shell, allowing the center and the public to follow her journey. The center partnered with the Smithsonian to get the satellite tag, and the public can follow Dilly Dally's journey at Marinelife Turtle Tracker.</p>

          <p>A report by Harvard University indicates that the United States continues to lead China in critical technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, semiconductors, space, and quantum. The report attributes the U.S.'s competitive edge to large-scale public and private investment, a diverse research workforce, and a decentralized innovation ecosystem. However, the report also notes that China is rapidly closing the gap, particularly in areas like high-quality scientific research output. The authors emphasized the importance of private and public funding resources, where the U.S. currently holds an advantage.</p>

          <h2>Democrats Need Economic Populism to Win Young Voters</h2>

          <p>According to Victoria Yang, the interim president of NextGen America, Democrats need to embrace economic populism to win back young voters. Young people are concerned about cost-of-living issues and feel the system is rigged, preferring candidates who directly address economic concerns like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Focus groups showed that young voters are anxious about their financial future and rising costs of housing, food, and education. NextGen's work shows that consistent engagement with young voters is key, as they are at the beginning of their voting journey and need to be educated.</p>
