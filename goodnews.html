          <p>Detroit Police Sgt. Shannon Jones launched Operation UNITED to exhume unidentified crime victims from "paupers' graves" and use DNA analysis to solve cold cases. Inspired by photos of missing loved ones, Jones partnered with FBI Special Agent Leslie Larsen to execute the large-scale exhumation project. The operation has resulted in 33 positive identifications, bringing closure to families who have suffered for decades. Other cities across the country have reached out to Jones and Larsen, wanting to launch similar projects to bring closure to families.</p>

          <p>The city of Xian in western China is experiencing a surge in tourism, leading to the growth of "emergent" jobs, particularly in the traditional Chinese clothing (hanfu) industry. Tourists are increasingly interested in dressing up in elaborate costumes for photoshoots at historical sites, creating demand for costumiers, make-up artists, and photographers. This trend aligns with government efforts to promote traditional culture and national confidence. Last year, Xian saw roughly 306 million trips, generating significant tourism income.</p>

          <p>President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the United Kingdom at the G7 summit, alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump accidentally dropped the document and initially stated the agreement was with the European Union, later corrected by the White House. When questioned about the differences between this agreement and one signed in May, Trump said, "Not much." The White House provided details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, stating the Commerce Secretary will determine a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without tariffs.</p>

          <p>Singer Nezza sang a Spanish version of ‚ÄúThe Star-Spangled Banner,‚Äù also known as ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù at Dodger Stadium, despite being told to sing it in English. Nezza's performance sparked conversations about the origins of ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado,‚Äù resurfacing the legacy of Clotilde Arias, a Latina composer who translated the anthem in 1945. Arias' translation was commissioned by the U.S. State Department to strengthen ties with Latin American countries during World War II, and it was the only official translation allowed to be sung. For Nezza, Arias‚Äô ‚ÄúEl Pend√≥n Estrellado‚Äù is a symbol of American pride and a piece of forgotten Latino history.</p>

          <p>Zhang Chaoyang, founder of Sohu.com, is advising students to skip graduate school and defer startup plans, citing his own experiences. Zhang said his postgraduate degree did not significantly contribute to his success in establishing and running his company. Instead, he suggested that college graduates gain practical know-how by working at a company before starting their own business. Zhang obtained a PhD in physics from MIT and founded Internet Technologies China, which later became Sohu.com.</p>

          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are vying to bring the Stanley Cup back to Canada for the first time since 1993, heading to Miami for the final games against the Florida Panthers. The winner of the National Hockey League's top prize has gone to an American team for over 30 years, a sore point for Canadian fans. Despite the tensions between Canada and the US, a Canadian win would be a "cherry on top", according to fans. The rivalry between the two countries really came to a head during the winter's 4 Nations Face Off, when Trump was repeatedly making digs at Canada by calling it the "51st state".</p>

          <p>The Arizona Humane Society rescued a pit bull terrier named Rainbow Brite and her nine puppies from the heat. The dog was painted to look like a leopard and tethered to a leash outdoors in the heat. The owner surrendered the 5-year-old dog and her puppies to the shelter, agreeing that they "could no longer care for them." Rainbow Brite and her large litter went to the Lazin Animal Foundation Trauma Hospital, and they have since been transferred to AHS's "Mutternity Suites," a calming space dedicated to the shelter's pregnant and nursing mama dogs.</p>
