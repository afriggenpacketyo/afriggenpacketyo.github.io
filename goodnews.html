          <p>Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Olha Stefanishyna, described the recent meeting between Presidents Zelenskyy and Trump as their "longest and most thorough" yet, fostering a sense of trust. She indicated that President Trump now has a better understanding of the situation after previously receiving incorrect information from Russian sources. The ambassador emphasized that this newfound trust is vital for securing U.S. contributions to Ukraine's long-term security guarantees. The dialogue is progressing well, aiming to deter any future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can reclaim all its territory from Russia. Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump posted on social media that with European and NATO support, Ukraine could restore its original borders, citing Russia's economic troubles. This marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to cede land for peace. Zelenskyy welcomed the change, calling it a "positive signal" and a "big shift" in the U.S. position on the conflict.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches at Bethpage, New York, golf experts are analyzing how Team Europe can overcome the significant home-field advantage that has dominated recent contests. Key factors for a European victory include managing the notoriously raucous American crowd, with captain Luke Donald preparing his players for a "bear pit" atmosphere. The team's stability is also seen as a major advantage, with only one player change from their victorious 2023 squad. The performance of veteran leaders like Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm will be crucial to securing a rare away win.</p>

          <p>European defense company stocks experienced a significant rally following President Trump's unexpected pivot in support of Ukraine's war efforts. Companies like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt saw their share prices climb after Trump stated Ukraine could win back all its territory with NATO support. The comments boosted investor confidence in the defense sector, which has been a key supplier to NATO members aiding Ukraine. The market gains contrasted with broader European market declines attributed to comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first show since a brief suspension, an emotional Jimmy Kimmel addressed the controversy over his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, stating it was never his intention to make light of the murder. He strongly criticized what he called "anti-American" threats to free speech, taking aim at FCC chair Brendan Carr and President Trump's calls for his firing. The show, which was not aired by some local affiliates, also featured a skit with actor Robert De Niro portraying the FCC chair, satirizing the pressure placed on the network.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in fraudulent payments over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraud during the Covid-19 pandemic, with other recoveries from unlawful council tax and social housing claims. The AI tool, which cross-references data across government departments to identify weaknesses, will now be licensed to international partners like the U.S. and Australia. The initiative has faced some criticism from civil liberties groups over the government's use of AI.</p>

          <p>China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi described a visit from a bipartisan U.S. House of Representatives delegation as an "ice-breaking journey," marking the first such trip in six years. During the meeting in Beijing, Wang emphasized that the two nations should be partners, not rivals, and urged Washington to respect its commitments regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication and helping the U.S. to "understand China accurately" amid a period of stabilizing but still tense bilateral relations.</p>

The article explores how his ambition and self-awareness resonate with a younger generation, contrasting with the humility of past icons like Messi. Raised in a working-class neighborhood and toughened by personal hardship, Yamal embraces the responsibility of his prodigious talent.

          <p>Eve Graham, a 67-year-old woman from the Scottish Highlands, has spoken out about enduring nearly five decades of physical, mental, and financial abuse from her husband. She found the confidence to report him to the police only after discovering a new hobby in welding and sculpture, which offered a path to financial independence. Her husband was subsequently jailed for two years for assault. Graham hopes that by sharing her story of a life that was at times a "living hell," she can encourage other victims of domestic abuse to seek help and escape their situations.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a plan for an $850 billion infrastructure expansion in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank to build a network of massive AI data centers. The project, which will require the electrical capacity of over 13 million homes, is a response to what Altman calls soaring demand for AI, evidenced by ChatGPT's tenfold usage increase. While critics raise concerns about a potential bubble and a circular financing model among the partners, OpenAI executives insist the historic buildout is necessary to meet the enormous computational needs of advanced artificial intelligence.

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during this summer's heavy rains, thanks to a major waterway renovation project completed over 15 years ago. The project, spearheaded by former mayor Geng Yanbo, involved widening the city's main river and reinforcing its banks, a move once criticized as wasteful due to the region's typically low rainfall. However, the infrastructure proved crucial in managing almost 20 hours of upstream flood discharges. Economists suggest such long-term investments in urban resilience can also serve as effective short-term economic stimuli for other regions.</p>

          <p>Australia's national broadcaster, the ABC, has been ordered to pay A$150,000 in penalties for the unlawful dismissal of presenter Antoinette Lattouf. A federal court found that Lattouf was taken off the air due to her political views after she shared a Human Rights Watch post about the war in Gaza, following lobbying from pro-Israel groups. The judge stated the substantial penalty was necessary to ensure the ABC understood the unacceptability of its actions, which he described as surrendering its employee's rights to appease a lobby group. The ABC has issued a public apology to Lattouf.</p>
