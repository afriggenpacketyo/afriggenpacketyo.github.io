          <h2>New Research Identifies Link Between Gut Bacteria and Genetic Variants in Ulcerative Colitis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:50:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a common gene variant and certain gut bacteria that can trigger severe intestinal inflammation characteristic of ulcerative colitis. The study, published in Science Immunology, found that a molecule produced by some bacteria over-activates an immune pathway in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene. This finding helps explain the variability of the disease and why some patients respond poorly to existing treatments. The discovery could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific mechanism rather than broadly suppressing the immune system.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, which counts investor Peter Thiel among its backers, has filed for an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, the company is the latest digital asset firm to pursue a public listing, reflecting a growing trend of crypto businesses entering mainstream financial markets. The move comes as the industry gains institutional acceptance and shortly after President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, the first major U.S. law providing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The filing signals continued momentum for the crypto sector's integration into the traditional economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Documentary 'Afternoons of Solitude' Offers an Unflinching Look at Bullfighting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:13:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spanish director Albert Serra's first documentary, "Afternoons of Solitude," provides a stark and immersive examination of the world of bullfighting. The film follows star Peruvian matador Andrés Roca Rey, focusing on the intricate rituals, palpable danger, and gruesome reality of the controversial tradition. Without offering explanation or judgment, the documentary uses long takes and a minimalist style to capture both the ornate ceremony and the brutal, unflinching moments of the bull's demise. The article praises the film for its honest and spellbinding portrayal of an ancient contest, intertwining meditation with the obscene realities of the spectacle.</p>

          <p>Ten wrongfully detained Americans have been freed from Venezuela and are returning to the United States following a complex prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating 252 Venezuelan nationals, whom the U.S. had deported there earlier this year under suspicion of gang affiliation. In exchange, Venezuela released the American citizens, including a former Navy SEAL, as well as dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners. U.S. officials described the negotiations as being "down to the wire" and credited Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for his critical role in facilitating the humanitarian agreement.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day visit to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is seen as a sign of Canberra's strengthening resolve in its diplomatic strategy. The trip, occurring after a period of reset relations with Beijing, demonstrates Australia's approach to navigating the complex rivalry between China and the United States. During the visit, Albanese participated in a CEO roundtable and was honored at a banquet where a band played iconic Australian songs. Analysts note that Australia's situation reflects a common challenge in the region as nations work to maintain relationships with competing global powers.</p>

          <p>A $50 million civil lawsuit accusing sports media personality Shannon Sharpe of sexual assault has been settled.

          <p>Despite being an early pioneer in artificial intelligence research, Meta is now playing catch-up to rivals like OpenAI and Google. To accelerate its efforts, the company has launched a new division, Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), and is aggressively recruiting top talent with massive compensation packages. This strategic overhaul aims to build "personal superintelligence for everyone" but comes after its existing Llama models have struggled to compete at the highest level. While Meta has vast resources, it must contend with its late start and a potential need to shift away from its original open-source AI strategy to keep pace.</p>

          <p>Shares of the fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, surged after it was announced the company will be added to the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index-tracking funds must purchase shares to rebalance their portfolios. Founded by Jack Dorsey, Block's addition reflects the growing market capitalization of technology firms and their increasing prominence within the benchmark index, despite the company's stock underperforming the broader market this year.

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority of the public continues to believe the 1969 moon landing was a worthwhile endeavor. These views are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, suggesting widespread public backing for continued space exploration and its contributions to national pride and technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Shares of online real estate company Opendoor skyrocketed 189% this week, largely driven by the enthusiastic endorsement of hedge fund manager Eric Jackson. Jackson, whose firm EMJ Capital had previously invested in the company, posted on social media that he was back in the stock and believed it could be a "100-bagger." This sparked a massive trading volume, lifting the stock from near-delisting levels to over $2 per share, despite no fundamental improvements in the cash-burning business. The event highlights the significant influence of social media sentiment on speculative, downtrodden stocks in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>
