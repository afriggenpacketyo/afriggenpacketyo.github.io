        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, introduced a resolution requiring Congressional debate and a vote before any U.S. military force is used against Iran, echoing sentiments previously expressed by President Donald Trump. Kaine voiced concerns that escalating tensions between Israel and Iran could draw the United States into another prolonged conflict in the Middle East. Trump has consistently advocated for ending "endless wars," preferring diplomatic solutions, and urging Iranian leaders to negotiate a nuclear deal. Kaine's resolution underscores Congress's constitutional power to declare war, emphasizing that any action against Iran requires explicit authorization, reflecting a rare point of agreement between political adversaries on foreign policy. </p>

          <p>Despite escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, financial markets have remained relatively stable, with U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Traders and investors are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that significantly disrupts the global economy. Analysts suggest that the price of oil is the most critical factor for the global economy, with potential disruptions to the Strait of Hormuz posing the greatest risk. While a geopolitical risk premium is already factored into the market, increased oil production by OPEC provides a counterbalance, suggesting a cautious but not panicked market response.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the rights that the U.S. government has with its golden share.

          <p>With shortages of brand-name obesity drugs ending, a new chapter is emerging for online sales of compounded alternatives, testing the limits of FDA regulations. Telehealth companies like OrderlyMeds are exploring ways to continue offering compounded versions of drugs like tirzepatide and semaglutide, by personalizing them with added supplements. The FDA allows compounding pharmacies to make copies of brand-name drugs during shortages, but the line between a copy and a personalized medicine is unclear. Some companies are facing legal challenges from brand-name drugmakers, while others are partnering with them to offer lower-priced options directly to consumers. </p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's Proba-3 mission has successfully created an artificial solar eclipse using two spacecraft flying in precise formation, allowing scientists to observe the sun's corona in unprecedented detail. The mission, consisting of the Occulter and Coronagraph spacecraft, blocks out the sun's light to reveal the surrounding corona, which is much hotter than the sun's surface and remains a scientific mystery. This technology allows astronomers to study the solar corona close to the solar rim, improving understanding of solar weather and its potential impact on Earth's telecommunications and power grids.
