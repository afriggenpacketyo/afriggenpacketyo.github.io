          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has made a successful start at the Cincinnati Open, winning her first match since adding Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francis Roig, to her team. She defeated Serbian player Olga Danilovic 6-3, 6-2, demonstrating strong form ahead of the US Open. After an early exchange of breaks, Raducanu gained control and dominated the second set. She will next face world number one Aryna Sabalenka, who also advanced after defeating Marketa Vondrousova. Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek also secured a win, advancing to the last 32.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set for his home debut, but his first weeks have been marked by significant club chaos, including a dispute over the registration of new players due to financial issues. A conflict with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen nearly delayed Rashford's eligibility, but a resolution should allow him to play in the La Liga opener. The club is also racing to complete renovations on its Nou Camp stadium, forcing early games to be played away or at a small training ground. Despite the off-field drama, Rashford has impressed in pre-season, scoring his first goal.</p>

          <p>Rachel Kettlewell, a former part-time teacher, founded Fearne & Rosie, a healthy jam company, in 2019, which has since become the UK's fastest-growing jam brand. The company's products, which contain 40% less sugar and 70% more fruit than standard jams, are now stocked in over 5,100 stores, including major retailers like Waitrose and Tesco. Starting with a goal of being in 10 local farm shops, the business is now forecast to achieve £2 million in revenue for the 2025 financial year. As a B-Corp, the brand also donates 2% of its revenue to charitable causes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite progress in integrating refugees into the German workforce, a significant employment gap persists between men and women, with two-thirds of female refugees remaining unemployed after eight years. Researchers point to a "threefold disadvantage" for these women, stemming from their gender, immigrant status, and refugee experience, often compounded by childcare responsibilities. Various publicly funded projects and non-profits like 'Work for Refugees' are addressing these challenges. They provide tailored support, including counseling and job fairs, to help women overcome hurdles like language barriers and the difficult process of getting foreign credentials recognized.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a commanding performance in a 9-1 victory against the Toronto Blue Jays, signaling his strong return from a four-month injury recovery. The two-time Cy Young winner struck out ten batters over five scoreless innings, showcasing the form that earned him a five-year, $182 million contract. The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, with home runs from Max Muncy and Shohei Ohtani, who hit his 40th of the season. Snell's successful outing contributes to an increasingly formidable Dodgers starting rotation, which now appears healthy and deep heading toward the postseason.</p>

          <p>During the Dallas Cowboys' preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams, star receiver CeeDee Lamb was inadvertently knocked to the ground by a sprinting official. Lamb, who was not playing and was watching from the sideline in street clothes, was standing too close to the field when the official, tracking the play, ran into his back. Despite being the one hit, Lamb and the Cowboys were assessed a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for making contact with an official. Lamb appeared uninjured and laughed off the bizarre collision with his teammates on the bench.</p>

          <p>The "quiet luxury" trend of understated opulence is giving way to a resurgence of "loud luxury," characterized by visible logos and bold, statement-making designs. Ailing high-end fashion houses are making this shift, driven by new creative directors at brands like Gucci and Versace, to inject novelty and combat soft consumer sentiment. After a period where many brands struggled, the industry is cycling back to more distinctive styles to recapture market desire. This change comes as brands also navigate the fallout from significant post-pandemic price hikes, which alienated some consumers. (not investment advice)</p>
