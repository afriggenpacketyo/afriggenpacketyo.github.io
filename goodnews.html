Satellite images show the destroyer in Rajin, a port within North Korea's Rason special economic zone. Analysts suggest this location could facilitate deeper economic and military ties with Moscow. The warship sustained damage during its launch on May 21, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered its repair by the end of June. There are concerns that there is damage to sonar systems, and foreign assistance may be required. The future of this vessel remains in question.</p>
