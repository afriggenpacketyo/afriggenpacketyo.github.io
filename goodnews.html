Regarding Pinterest, the investor was disappointed with its monetization efforts and its tendency to be slowed down by headwinds, like a plunge in advertisement pricing.

          <p>A new parenting style called "emotionally safe parenting" is gaining traction, emphasizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach encourages parents to accept their child's emotions without immediate fixes, respond without shame, and view "bad" behavior as stress signals. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, create an environment where children feel safe expressing emotions, and lead with calm, steady authority. This style involves parents doing their own inner work to become less reactive and more attuned to their children's emotional needs, fostering trust and connection.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to leave out Man City midfielder Jack Grealish. The article discusses potential changes to the team's lineup, noting that several players may be leaving, including Kevin De Bruyne and Kyle Walker. New faces will come, especially in positions where we are weaker, but I don't think a lot. We have players under contract who want to stay here and I don't want a lot of players. It will be an important period of transition off the pitch too.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris stated the win was incredible, though he found pole position more emotional. Stella stated that Norris deserves to be praised for a very, very well-managed and executed weekend. Verstappen stated that he had no grip. A change to the rules, introducing tougher tests on the flexibility of front wings will affect all the teams.</p>
