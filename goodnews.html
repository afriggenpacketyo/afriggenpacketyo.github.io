          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two future Hall of Fame pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong performances, with Kershaw allowing only one run over six innings while navigating several threats. The game remained a tight duel until the fifth inning when a Mookie Betts two-run homer gave the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish. The game highlighted the enduring skill of two of baseball's most decorated pitchers, even in the later stages of their careers.</p>

          <p>The European Union has sanctioned an Indian refinery for processing discounted Russian crude oil, raising questions about the future of a potential EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts believe this move is largely symbolic and will not significantly impact trade negotiations, which are a priority for both sides seeking economic stability. The article suggests that the greater pressure on India comes from the threat of US tariffs, which could paradoxically push New Delhi closer to securing a deal with the EU. This dynamic highlights the complex interplay of global trade relationships amid geopolitical tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

Webster, the only person in U.S. history to serve as director of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency, has passed away at the age of 101.

Appointed as FBI director by President Jimmy Carter and later as CIA director by President Ronald Reagan, he was widely respected for his integrity and dedication.

          <p>The UK government has reformed its prestigious civil service summer internship program to exclusively target applicants from lower socio-economic backgrounds, sparking a divided reaction among students. The policy aims to make the civil service more representative of society, with some students from working-class families now feeling encouraged to apply. However, other students, who also consider themselves from modest backgrounds but do not meet the strict new criteria, feel unfairly excluded from a key career pathway. This article explores these differing perspectives on a measure intended to improve social mobility within government.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds in a laboratory, a significant breakthrough in materials science. This rare form of diamond, first discovered in an Arizona meteorite in 1967, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to form under immense heat and pressure. Previous attempts by global research teams had struggled to produce pure samples of this material, known as lonsdaleite. The achievement provides definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence and opens new possibilities for its study and application.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old London entrepreneur, Lucy Rout, has created Haystack Dating, a business that hosts in-person events to combat the fatigue and negative mental health impacts of dating apps. After experiencing "dating burnout" herself, she designed a model where attendees participate in group activities after being matched by an algorithm based on interests and personality traits. The goal is to foster more meaningful and accountable interactions in a safer environment than online platforms. The concept is tapping into a growing demand for real-life connections as studies show a decline in dating app usage.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery, made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealed he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, increasing his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. Hemsworth stated the news prompted a deeper self-reflection on his purpose and what he contributes to the world, rather than just what he collects. This shift in mindset has influenced the second season of his show, making it more personal and educational.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on everything from small pick-me-ups like lipstick to major experiences like concerts to boost their morale during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," reflects a shift in consumer priorities, where everyday sacrifices are made to afford moments of joy. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, people are instead celebrating smaller "inch-stones." This trend is expected to persist as global economic and political volatility continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the renowned astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at the age of 97. Lovell famously guided his crew safely back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion crippled their spacecraft, turning a potential tragedy into what became known as a "successful failure." He was also a crew member on the historic Apollo 8 mission, the first to orbit the moon, where he described Earth as a "grand oasis." Remembered for his calm demeanor under extreme pressure, Lovell's career as a naval aviator and astronaut left an indelible mark on the history of space exploration.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent settlement between actress Gina Carano and Disney, arguing that the resolution was the "right thing to do" rather than an example of corporate capitulation to political pressure. Carano was fired from "The Mandalorian" in 2021 over controversial social media posts, a move the author deems an overreaction and an example of pandering to a "hashtag campaign." The settlement, which was financially backed by Elon Musk and includes a statement from Lucasfilm hoping for future collaboration, is framed as a correction to an extreme initial decision, separate from broader trends of "cancel culture."</p>
