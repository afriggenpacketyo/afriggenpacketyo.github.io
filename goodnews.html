          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift towards a more polarized political landscape in Britain. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes, seizing a seat previously held by Labour, after the former Labour MP was convicted of assault. This win could indicate growing anti-incumbent sentiment fueled by economic dissatisfaction and immigration concerns, potentially impacting Prime Minister Keir Starmer's party. The article notes that Reform's gains in local council elections could further solidify their position as a rival to the major parties, capitalizing on voter frustration with both Labour and the Conservatives. </p>

          <p>Apple is moving the production of iPhones bound for the U.S. away from China, with India becoming a primary manufacturing hub, due to rising tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. CEO Tim Cook stated that Vietnam will also serve as a major production center for iPads and Apple Watches. This shift comes as Apple estimates U.S. import taxes could add $900 million to its costs, despite electronics being spared from the tariffs. The article mentions that while production is shifting, it will take time and significant investment, with China remaining the main production location for products sold outside the U.S.</p>
