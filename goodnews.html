          <p>This article provides detailed profiles of twenty Israeli and foreign hostages, believed to be alive and expected to be released under a newly brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Abducted during the October 7th attacks, these individuals, including musician Alon Ohel, the Cunio brothers, and engineer Avinatan Or, have endured over two years in captivity. Their families, like Idit Ohel and Matan Zangauker's mother, have become leading voices in advocacy, sharing poignant stories of their loved ones' lives and the psychological toll of their prolonged absence. The article highlights the personal struggles and public efforts, with some families receiving recent signs of life, underscoring the immense human stakes involved in the anticipated exchange and the fragile hope it brings for their reunion.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump asserted that the war in Gaza is over, expressing confidence that the ceasefire will hold as he travels to a peace summit in Egypt. This article notes Trump's comments were made while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had not yet made such a declaration. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee criticized UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson's claims about Britain's "key role" in securing the truce, attributing credit to Trump. Germany is preparing to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, highlighting the immense destruction and international efforts to rebuild the region.</p>

          <p>The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) has announced a significant increase in undergraduate enrollment for the second consecutive year, welcoming 1,220 new freshmen for Fall 2025. This incoming class boasts an impressive average ACT score of 27 and a GPA of 3.97, reflecting the high quality of education offered. Total undergraduate enrollment has reached 6,743 students, with the university focusing on controlled growth and increasing in-state enrollment. A relatively new Tennessee Resident Scholarship Program is also successfully attracting more students by offering in-state tuition, though the university is now actively monitoring housing as a potential challenge due to these growing numbers.</p>

          <p>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who rose to power after overthrowing the Assad regime, outlined his vision for rebuilding a "new and free Syria" following nearly 14 years of civil war. He acknowledged the immense destruction, with half the population displaced and reconstruction costs estimated at $600-900 billion, calling for international support and the lifting of economic sanctions. Al-Sharaa, a former al Qaeda affiliate leader with a $10 million US bounty, discussed his past, his pragmatism, and current challenges, including sectarian violence and Israeli incursions. He aims for general elections and a democracy once infrastructure is restored, asserting Syria seeks peace and does not want to engage in wars.</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges of maintaining adult friendships amidst life changes like careers, marriage, and family, noting that half of friendships are lost every seven years. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco and author Claire Cohen emphasize that relationships shift, making friendships vulnerable to "collateral damage." The article advocates for honest communication, vulnerability, and creativity in making time for friends, even through "mundane connection" like tidying together. Experts stress the importance of in-person interactions over virtual messaging to combat "relational loneliness" and suggest reframing socialising as a positive future outcome. The article encourages trusting that friends are more liked than perceived, and taking risks to rekindle connections.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Use Thermal Cameras to Objectively Measure Stress Levels Through Facial Temperature Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:28:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists from the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, revealing that a drop in nose temperature can serve as an objective measure of stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test, a reporter experienced a two-degree drop in nose temperature, indicating blood flow shifts away from the nose as a physical reaction to perceived danger. Lead researcher Professor Gillian Forrester suggests this "nasal dip" is a robust marker of changing stress states, with recovery time potentially indicating risks for anxiety or depression. This non-invasive technique could be a "game changer" for monitoring stress in humans and non-human apes, offering new avenues for managing harmful stress levels.</p>

          <h2>IFS Warns Against "Half-Baked" Tax Fixes in UK Budget, Urges Comprehensive Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 19:21:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming Budget, urging comprehensive tax system reform instead. With pressure to raise tens of billions to meet fiscal rules, the IFS warns that some potential tax rises could be "especially economically harmful." The think tank suggests reforms to property tax and capital gains tax as "good places to start," advocating for a system that aligns tax rates across different income forms for fairness and growth. It cautions against a wealth tax and restricting pension contribution relief, recommending better options for increasing pension taxation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has arrived in Egypt for an international peace summit, where a Gaza peace plan is slated for signing. Downing Street stated Starmer would commend US President Donald Trump's critical role in brokering the ceasefire and hostage deal. This article highlights Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson's earlier claim of a "key role" for the UK in shaping the plan, which was publicly disputed by US Ambassador Mike Huckabee and Israel's deputy foreign minister, Sharren Haskel. The summit aims to formalize the peace plan, secure the ceasefire's next phases, and coordinate urgently needed humanitarian aid, marking a significant diplomatic effort for regional stability.</p>

          <p>Paramount, backed by billionaire Larry Ellison and his family, has officially opened bidding for Warner Bros. Discovery, aiming for a massive merger that could reshape Hollywood. Warner Bros. Discovery's board rejected Paramount's initial $20-a-share bid, but discussions are ongoing, with a second bid anticipated. David Ellison, leading Paramount's acquisition efforts, seeks to expand content offerings to better compete with tech giants like Netflix and Amazon in the streaming landscape. The potential merger, which could consolidate CNN with CBS News, comes as Warner Bros. Discovery plans to divide its assets and carries substantial debt, despite recent box office successes, highlighting the strategic maneuvers in a consolidating media industry.</p>

          <p>This opinion article explores India's strategic balancing act between the US and China, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi Jinping recently agreed to be "partners" rather than "rivals" on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Modi emphasized the need for "strategic autonomy" and not viewing bilateral relations through a "third country lens," subtly pushing back against US President Donald Trump's tough stance on India. The resumption of direct flights between the nations, after a five-year hiatus, signals a shared commitment to improving ties. Both leaders envision Sino-Indian relations as an anchor for a multipolar world and a new Asian century, focusing on cooperation within the Global South and promoting developing countries' solidarity.</p>

          <p>Australia's women's cricket team achieved a historic three-wicket victory over India, completing their first ODI chase over 300 runs in the Women's Cricket World Cup 2025. Captain Alyssa Healy, known for her intense competitiveness, led the charge with a remarkable century, her fastest at a World Cup, despite recent struggles with form. This triumph, following another strong comeback win, reinforces Australia's dominance in the sport, having won seven World Cups and six T20 titles. While Healy has achieved much in her 15-year career, winning a global event as captain in 50-over cricket remains her final "mountain to climb," setting the stage for a compelling end to her captaincy.</p>
