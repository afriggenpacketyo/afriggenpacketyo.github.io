          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will rescind its digital services tax (DST) on large technology firms, a move made just before the first payments were due. This decision came after the U.S. administration called the tax a "blatant attack" and threatened to halt trade deal negotiations. The 3% tax on Canadian revenue would have affected major U.S. tech companies like Google and Amazon, and was projected to generate C$5.9 billion over five years. The reversal aims to restart crucial trade talks between the two North American neighbors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have been identified as the "biggest winners" of the Federal Reserve's 2025 annual stress tests, according to Wall Street analysts. Both banks saw their stress capital buffer requirements lowered more significantly than their peers, indicating improved resilience in hypothetical economic downturns. This easing of capital requirements could allow the banks to increase shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, as well as pursue more loan growth. The results are seen as part of a broader trend of a more favorable regulatory environment for large banks. (not investment advice)</p>

The Treasury Department has already issued guidance to roll back some financial restrictions to encourage new investment.

Dunne was found strangled in her home nearly six decades ago, but the case went unsolved despite a massive investigation. The case was cracked decades later when DNA from a semen swab taken at the scene was finally linked to Headley, a convicted rapist with a history of similar attacks.

The increases are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments.
