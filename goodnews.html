          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to increase defense spending goals to 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%. In 2024, NATO member countries spent an average of 2.61% of their GDP on defense, with 22 of 32 members meeting or exceeding the 2% benchmark. Poland spent the highest percentage of its GDP on defense, while Spain allocated the smallest share. The targets are not legally binding, and some allies may opt out of the 5% goal.</p>

          <p>Twenty-two families in southwest Fresno have become first-time homeowners by constructing their own houses through the Mutual Self-Help Housing program. The program, run by Self-Help Enterprises, empowers low-income families to build homes collectively, providing training and supervision. The project represents a $1.46 million investment from the city of Fresno to address the housing crisis, with families investing their time and energy into construction tasks like pouring foundations and wiring. The initiative aims to provide opportunities for wealth creation and community building in an area that has suffered from decades of neglect.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that using copyrighted books to train AI models is fair use, marking a victory for Anthropic, which trained its AI assistant Claude using such materials. The judge stated that this use was "exceedingly transformative" but noted that Anthropic may have infringed copyright by using pirated books. A trial is set to determine damages related to the use of pirated materials, with potential penalties reaching up to $150,000 per instance of willful copyright infringement. The court emphasized that AI models use the works to create something different, similar to how a reader learns from and emulates various writing styles.</p>

          <p>Industry insiders at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin suggest that Chinese companies should relocate their entire manufacturing ecosystems overseas to ensure successful global expansion. This approach, rather than simply assembling goods in other countries, would bolster the resilience of their supply chains amid rising global trade uncertainties. With expectations of increased tariffs and worsening trade tensions, particularly in the event of a second term for U.S. President Donald Trump, building factories in new markets becomes crucial for both export and local sales. This strategic shift aims to circumvent potential tariffs and strengthen supply chain stability.</p>

Republicans, however, are eager to portray Mamdani's policies as evidence of the Democratic Party's move to the far left. While the election's local context limits broader national implications, Mamdani's success highlights the importance of energy, economic focus, and clear communication for Democrats.</p>

This move signals a significant shift towards integrating crypto into the traditional financial system, specifically within the American home lending process. The directive instructs the housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars prior to loan closing. This initiative aligns with President Donald Trump's vision of establishing the United States as the crypto capital of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington state has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for EV chargers to 14 states, which had sued to challenge the ongoing freeze on those funds. The judge's preliminary injunction requires the Department of Transportation to stop withholding funds from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program and distribute them to the states after a seven-day pause for potential appeal. The lawsuit alleges that the freeze disrupted projects underway and hampered states' ability to meet carbon emission reduction targets.
