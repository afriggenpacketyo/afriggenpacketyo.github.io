          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor engaged in a debate covering key issues such as housing, affordability, crime, and their approaches to dealing with the Trump administration. Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani emerged as frontrunners, sparring over their records and campaign funding. Cuomo faced criticism for his handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations, while current Mayor Eric Adams was also a frequent target despite not participating in the debate. The Democratic primary election is scheduled for June 24, utilizing a ranked-choice ballot system.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers are dominated by Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected reversal of winter fuel payment cuts, with the Times reporting the payment will be restored but clawed back through higher taxes. The Guardian expresses fears of "chaos" over recovering the sums from deceased pensioners, while the Daily Express highlights support for a full U-turn. The i Paper reports the chancellor received a donation from a lobbying firm linked to a Thames Water bidder, and the Mail focuses on immigration policy debates between Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch.

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island in Puget Sound, in its largest operation of its kind. The agency airlifted 14 vessels to the mainland for deconstruction, opting for this method to avoid disrupting the marine bed and surrounding environment. The Squaxin Island Tribe supports the cleanup, as the island is of cultural importance and used for fishing and gathering. The boat removal program has hauled out over 1,200 derelict vessels since 2002, addressing the challenge of improper boat disposal.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers conducted a detailed structural study of 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, gaining insight into feather evolution during this era. The development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was essential to the evolution of birds, and the study enhances our understanding of avian evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect us from dangerous infections, and the study shows that beneficial bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were found only in babies born via vaginal delivery, and the research could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County‚Äôs coastline, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp. The order halts restart efforts on the operation‚Äôs onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015, and Sable is now targeting August 1 for first sales due to this delay. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review, and the ruling is celebrated by plaintiffs seeking a public process. The 2015 Refugio oil spill looms large, galvanizing opposition to the project.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, raising questions about access to the medication. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, and experts say concerns are misguided, fueled by a report from an advocacy group. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000, and periodic reviews have not found new safety concerns, but the latest review comes after challenges targeting the availability of the pill. Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the U.S. health care system in 2023.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts in the UK are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. It's not known whether taking medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm an unborn baby, and the advice already appears in patient information leaflets. Concerns are growing that the popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice, and the MHRA advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less effective in those who are overweight or obese.</p>
