          <p>The Japanese government unveiled a five-year plan on Tuesday to support the video game and anime industries, aiming to boost the country's entertainment sector as a key source of exports. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced the plan, which includes measures to support video game production costs and improve working conditions in the anime industry. The plan also incorporates anti-piracy measures, such as stronger investigations and enforcement, to protect intellectual property. This initiative reflects Japan's commitment to fostering its creative industries and ensuring their continued global competitiveness.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists, including researchers from Asian countries, successfully transformed lead into gold, though the gold disappeared in microseconds. The discovery was published in a U.S. physics magazine last month, with the team's spokesperson at CERN noting that while the finding is experimental, it could advance human knowledge and enable the development of advanced equipment. This breakthrough highlights the potential for scientific exploration and discovery, even when practical applications are uncertain. The team hopes their findings will inspire further research in the field.</p>

          <p>China is expanding avenues for foreign institutions to utilize the yuan, aiming to diminish reliance on the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback wanes. The People's Bank of China is establishing a center for digital yuan internationalization in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. Recent measures include allowing qualified foreign institutional investors to trade additional futures and options contracts in mainland China, increasing the yuan's influence in global commodity pricing. While global finance institutions are interested in diversifying to China, strict capital controls and a relatively opaque system have hindered large-scale investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez relocated their Venice wedding party from the city center to a more isolated location due to protests against the event. Residents and pressure groups argued that the lavish celebration would transform the city into a private amusement park for the wealthy. The party, originally scheduled for Cannaregio's Scuola Grande di Santa Maria della Misericordia, was moved to the Arsenale, an exhibition space for the Venice Biennale art fair. Protesters planned demonstrations on Venice's canals and streets to disrupt the event, prompting the change in venue for security reasons.</p>

While global demand for meat is growing, lab-grown meat offers a technological fix to meet this demand more sustainably.

          <p>An analysis explores the changing attitudes of voters toward scandals, noting a shift from disqualification to a cost-benefit analysis. The case of Andrew Cuomo, who is running for mayor of New York despite multiple sexual harassment accusations, illustrates this trend. The #MeToo movement's impact has waned, and multiple scandals may dilute the effect on voters. The polarized political landscape also contributes to voters' willingness to overlook scandals in favor of electability or shared political goals.</p>
