          <p>A seven-year-old dog named Bastian, who was rescued from floodwaters during Hurricane Florence in 2018, has been awarded the title of "World's Cutest Rescue Dog" by People magazine. Initially very withdrawn after his rescue, his owner, Joelle Andres, helped him gain confidence by training him to use recordable buttons to communicate his needs. As part of the prize, People magazine will feature Bastian and donate $1,000 to the New Jersey animal alliance that facilitated his rescue and adoption.</p>

          <p>Bardsey Island, a remote island off the coast of Wales with a year-round population of just three people, is looking for a new family or couple to become tenants. The island, known as Ynys Enlli, is a national nature reserve and was recently designated Europe's first International Dark Sky Sanctuary. The new residents will be responsible for managing the island's 200 sheep and 25 cattle alongside the current tenant farmer. The trust that manages the island is advertising the rare opportunity for adventurous, nature-loving individuals to embrace an off-grid lifestyle.</p>

          <p>Dr. Kristina Douglass, an archaeologist at Columbia University, has been named a 2025 MacArthur Fellow for her research in southwest Madagascar. Her work challenges traditional narratives by demonstrating how ancient local communities have co-evolved with their environments and adapted to climate change over millennia, rather than simply degrading them. By studying artifacts and ancient kitchen waste, she has identified key survival strategies, including maintaining diverse social networks and flexible livelihoods. Douglass believes these historical insights offer valuable lessons for addressing today's global climate and biodiversity crises.</p>

          <p>Nabarun Dasgupta, a researcher at the University of North Carolina, has been awarded a MacArthur "genius" fellowship for his influential work combating the U.S. drug overdose crisis. Dasgupta was one of the first scientists to identify the recent significant decline in fatal overdoses, challenging the prevailing narrative of an unstoppable fentanyl crisis. In addition to his data analysis, he has been instrumental in developing harm reduction programs, including a national network for distributing the overdose-reversal drug naloxone. The foundation recognized his collaborative approach to designing effective, evidence-based interventions.</p>

          <p>Savor, a food-tech startup, has raised $33 million from investors including Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures to produce cooking fats like butter from carbon, eliminating the need for animals or plants. The company aims to create products that mimic the exact taste and texture of their traditional counterparts, thereby reducing the environmental strain of agriculture. While the science has been proven in a lab setting, the co-founders state that commercial viability is still years away as they work to make the production process affordable and scalable.</p>

          <p>UEFA is aiming to secure more than £4 billion per year from its next broadcast rights deal for its major club competitions, including the Champions League. The new deals, set to begin in 2027, are expected to involve a six-year commitment and could see streaming services like Amazon or Netflix acquire rights to one top-pick game per round. This potential increase in revenue, up from the current £2.9 billion annually, would primarily benefit the participating clubs, which currently receive nearly 75% of the income from UEFA's rights sales.</p>
