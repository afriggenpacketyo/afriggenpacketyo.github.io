          <h2>UK Spending Review Balances Patience and Impatience in Economic Strategy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 21:06:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's recent Spending Review signals a gamble on long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. While day-to-day spending is limited, and even cut in some areas, the government is prioritizing long-term investments. This approach contrasts with the typical political focus on short-term gains. The government hopes this strategy will lead to national renewal, but it requires patience from an electorate that has been feeling squeezed for years, with many people in England and Wales likely paying higher council tax to help fund the police.</p>

          <p>The United States is conducting a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with the "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending. The agreement, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines and foster collaboration on cutting-edge technology as a response to China's growing power. Officials from Australia and the UK have downplayed the review, viewing it as a natural reassessment by the new administration.</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of dinosaur, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, from museum collections in Mongolia. This species, dating back 86 million years, is considered the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including the T.rex. The discovery reveals insights into the evolution of tyrannosaurs from small, fleet-footed predators to formidable giants. Khankhuuluu represents a transitional fossil, weighing about 750kg, and showcases early evolutionary stages of features like skull anatomy that gave tyrannosaurs their powerful bite forces. The findings have helped revise the tyrannosaur family tree and rewrite the understanding of their evolution.</p>
