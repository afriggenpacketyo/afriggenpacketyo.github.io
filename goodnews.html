        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy faces a looming risk of stagflation, characterized by higher unemployment, higher inflation, and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the increased risks of these factors, though stagflation is not yet present. Swiftly shifting tariff policies and related uncertainty are major contributors to these fears, potentially causing businesses to delay hiring and investment. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings, as experts suggest the Fed may lower interest rates if stagflation materializes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has directed the US health secretary to negotiate lower prescription drug prices, aiming to align them with those in other developed countries. This move, announced via social media, initially caused a sharp fall in drugmakers' share prices, although skepticism later tempered the market reaction. The plan targets Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, potentially including GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to strongly resist these changes, citing potential impacts on research and development investments.</p>

          <p>Bob Worsley, a conservative Republican, is advocating for a more generous immigration policy, emphasizing the need for a secure workforce and larger legal avenues for immigration. Worsley, chairman of the American Business Immigration Coalition, argues that building a wall and stopping all immigration is not a viable solution.
