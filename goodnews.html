          <h2>David Hogg Resigns DNC Vice Chair Post Amid Disagreement Over Party Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 20:14:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a fundamental disagreement with the party's leadership regarding the role of the vice chair. Hogg stated that he wants to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which aims to support aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC Chair Ken Martin acknowledged Hogg's activism and respected his decision to step down. The move follows the party's decision to redo the vice chair elections, although this was not directly related to Hogg's plans to support primary challenges against sitting Democrats. The article emphasizes that Hogg maintains respect for his fellow officers, despite their disagreements, as he continues to focus on building the strongest party possible. The situation underscores internal tensions within the DNC regarding the role of progressive activists and their approach to electoral strategy. </p>

          <p>Tiger Woods, despite being sidelined with an Achilles injury, shared insights on what golfers can expect at Oakmont Country Club for the U.S. Open. Woods, who finished tied for second at Oakmont in 2007, emphasized the importance of confidence and strong ball-striking, noting that the course favors longer hitters due to its challenging complexes. He highlighted the thickness of the rough and the treacherous greens, stressing the need for accuracy and strategic shot placement. Woods believes that golfers who can hit the ball long and straight, like Scottie Scheffler and Bryson DeChambeau, will have an advantage, as he underscores the unforgiving nature of Oakmont and the premium it places on precise execution. </p>

          <p>Teoscar Hern√°ndez hit a crucial three-run home run in the sixth inning, lifting the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory over the Padres. Hern√°ndez had been struggling at the plate recently, but his decisive hit broke open the tie game and secured a series win for the Dodgers. Ben Casparius delivered a solid four-inning start, and Michael Conforto added an opposite-field homer to tie the game earlier. The win gives the Dodgers a two-game lead in the division, but the Padres mounted a comeback effort, which was ultimately thwarted by strong relief pitching. </p>
