          <p>Germany is grappling with the question of how to deal with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), with growing concerns about societal polarization. The AfD has been classified as "confirmed right-wing extremist" by the German domestic intelligence service, but the party has challenged this in court. The new government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz faces the explosive question of whether to consider banning the AfD, with opponents arguing it would further divide society. Experts suggest journalists should change how they report on the AfD, focusing on countering its narratives with successful models of democracy.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the US and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva, Switzerland. This marks the first meeting since the US imposed steep tariffs on China in January. While Bessent did not disclose specific details, he mentioned that further information would be released on Monday and that President Trump has been informed. This development comes after both sides issued warnings before the meeting, with China insisting on easing tariffs and the US emphasizing de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade agreement.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced "substantial progress" in US-China trade talks in Geneva, potentially easing global economic concerns. While details are scarce, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a "deal" addressing national security concerns, though tariff reductions remain uncertain. The talks aim to alleviate tensions caused by tariffs that have disrupted global supply chains and raised recession fears. Both sides express a desire to lower tariffs, but significant issues remain, including China's subsidies and export bans.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that the United States had made ‚Äúsubstantial progress‚Äù in talks with China after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, and that additional details would be announced on Monday. Any indication of a trade truce between the world‚Äôs two largest economies would lift financial markets and ease concerns among companies, investors and economists that the global economy was poised for a sharp downturn. The talks have major implications for the global economy, which has been rocked by the tariffs that the United States and China have imposed on each other in recent months.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Discover Lost Temple in Peru, Solving Historical Puzzle</h2>

          <p>Archaeologists in northwestern Peru have unearthed the ruins of a ceremonial temple dating back 4,000 to 5,000 years. The site features walls, architectural elements indicating a temple, and skeletal remains. The ruins include friezes with images of cats, reptiles, and a human body with a bird's head, preserved in "fine plaster". The team believes the temple contains information about a people group predating known inhabitants of the region, and that the temple likely contains more information about a people group that predated the known inhabitants of the region.</p>
