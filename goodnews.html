          <p>Los Angeles County leaders are exploring the possibility of a water taxi service to transport fans between San Pedro and Long Beach during the 2028 Olympics. Supervisor Janice Hahn introduced a motion to launch a feasibility study to assess ridership demand, cost, and possible routes. The motion was unanimously approved and aims to provide an affordable alternative to driving and parking at the games venues. The water taxi could alleviate congestion along bridges connecting San Pedro and Long Beach, offering fans a convenient way to travel between the Croatia House in San Pedro and the Olympic events in Long Beach.</p>
