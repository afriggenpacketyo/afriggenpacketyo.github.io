          <h2>China Strengthens African Copper Supply Chain for Green Energy Initiatives</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 02:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the global green energy transition increases the demand for copper, China is strategically investing in African mining operations to secure its supply. This move is partly a response to Western countries, like Canada, restricting Chinese access to their critical mineral assets. Chinese companies are making significant investments in the copper sectors of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana, highlighting the mineral's crucial role in manufacturing EV batteries and solar panels. These actions demonstrate Beijing's proactive approach to resource diplomacy and its long-term planning for energy independence.</p>

          <p>The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has officially announced that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue after he passes away, ending years of speculation that he might be the last. Speaking from Dharamshala, India, the spiritual leader stated that the decision was made in response to requests from Buddhists worldwide. He affirmed that the traditional process of identifying his reincarnation will be followed, managed solely by his Gaden Phodrang Trust. This declaration is a significant move to counter potential interference from the Chinese government, which has indicated it might appoint its own successor.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng has reported its eighth consecutive month of strong sales, delivering over 34,000 cars in June amidst an intense domestic price war. This performance contrasts with mixed results from competitors like Nio, which saw a slight increase, and Li Auto, which experienced a drop in monthly deliveries. Meanwhile, market leader BYD continued its dominance with over 377,000 vehicles sold. The fierce competition, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government, also puts pressure on Tesla, whose sales in the country are projected to have declined year-over-year.

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia have announced a new "Quad" critical minerals initiative aimed at securing a stable supply chain and reducing reliance on China. In a joint statement, the four nations expressed concern that dependence on any single country creates vulnerability to economic coercion and supply disruptions. The move is a clear effort to counter China's dominance in minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies. The announcement was made following a meeting of the countries' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., where they reaffirmed their strategic partnership in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants this year. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, well before the previously established deadline of February 2026. The Brooklyn-based judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to vacate a country's TPS designation prematurely. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling, which currently protects migrants who have built lives in the U.S. based on the program's prior extension.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data shows that migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border dropped to a historic low in June, with Border Patrol recording just over 6,000 illegal crossings. This continues a significant lull in migration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced enforcement measures. For the second consecutive month, no migrants were released into the U.S. after being apprehended. These figures stand in stark contrast to the record-high numbers seen under the previous administration, reflecting a dramatic shift in border management and immigration control.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation is named "Amara's Law" in honor of Amara Strande, who testified before lawmakers about the public health crisis in her community while dying of a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. It was inspired by Strande's powerful advocacy, which drew a direct line from the chemicals, long manufactured by 3M in the state, to the suffering of her community.</p>
