        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Sunday Times Rich List reveals a decline in the number of UK billionaires, alongside an increase in King Charles' personal wealth. The number of billionaires has fallen from 165 to 156, marking the sharpest decline in the list's history, which compilers attribute to criticism of tax changes by the new Labour government. Simultaneously, King Charles' wealth has grown by ¬£30 million to ¬£640 million, equaling the wealth of Rishi Sunak and his wife. Topping the list for the fourth consecutive year is the Hinduja family, with a fortune exceeding ¬£35 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets amid concerns over President Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest net inflows since 1996. Analysts suggest this shift was driven by institutional investors seeking safe-haven assets, but the trend may not last as confidence in U.S. assets is restored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani homered twice and drove in six runs as the Dodgers dominated the Athletics, but the night was also significant for Dalton Rushing, a top prospect, who made his major league debut. Rushing had two hits and a walk, impressing manager Dave Roberts. The Dodgers' decision to call up Rushing led to the departure of longtime backup catcher Austin Barnes, a move that was difficult but deemed necessary to improve the team's roster. The article suggests that Rushing's debut signals a new chapter for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the authority to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law requires operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches to the government. The move reflects Japan's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations, with the goal of being fully operational with the measures by 2027.</p>

Archer Aviation hopes it will be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) "at similar levels of safety as commercial airliners".
