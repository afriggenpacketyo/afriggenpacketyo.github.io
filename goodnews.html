        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite facing increased tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies are adapting by onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts, although this may reduce product variety on Temu. Shein is expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey and Mexico, potentially absorbing tariffs due to high margins in fast fashion. Experts also highlight that agile supply chains and small-batch production contribute to their success, allowing them to quickly adapt to consumer trends and remain price-competitive even with tariffs.

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, citing concerns over antisemitism and diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated Harvard failed its "legal obligations," leading to the freeze of billions in research grants. This action follows similar measures against other universities amidst campus protests related to the Israeli-Gaza conflict.

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island express disbelief and opposition to Donald Trump's plan to reopen the former prison. Many view the idea as "insane" and impractical, citing the island's deteriorated infrastructure and high operating costs. Some visitors highlight Alcatraz's significance as a site of Indigenous resistance, arguing that turning it back into a prison would erase this history and perpetuate violent legacies. While a few support Trump's proposal, most believe it is a political stunt and prefer the island remain a national monument and tourist attraction.</p>
