          <p>A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning that was later downgraded to an advisory for the state's southern peninsula. Officials confirmed a tsunami was generated but stated that widespread, large waves are not expected due to the quake's shallow depth. The event was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, a seismically active region known as the "Ring of Fire," but did not pose a threat to Anchorage. Multiple aftershocks were reported following the main quake.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a partially cleared minefield in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously did the same 28 years prior. Working with the HALO Trust, the same charity his mother supported, the Duke of Sussex visited an area near Cuito Cuanavale to raise awareness about the ongoing danger of landmines. These explosives are a remnant of Angola's 27-year civil war, and despite significant clearing efforts, an estimated 1,000 minefields still pose a threat to local communities.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on his social media platform that he has convinced Coca-Cola to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its cola sold in the United States. In his post, Trump called the change "a very good move" and stated that cane sugar is "just better." Coca-Cola responded with a statement appreciating the president's enthusiasm and teasing "new innovative offerings" without explicitly confirming the switch. The company currently uses cane sugar in products sold in other countries, such as Mexico.</p>

          <p>Germany is expected to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country, closing a loophole that existed post-Brexit. This change will empower German authorities to investigate and disrupt smuggling operations, including targeting facilities used to store small boats. The commitment is part of a new, broader agreement on migration and defense between the U.K. and Germany.</p>

          <p>For the first time, astronomers have captured the birth of a planetary system around a young, sun-like star named HOPS-315, located 1,300 light-years away. Using data from the Webb Space Telescope and other observatories, scientists identified the formation of silicon monoxide, a mineral found in ancient meteorites in our own solar system. This discovery provides a glimpse into what our solar system may have looked like in its infancy, about 4.6 billion years ago. The observation marks a significant milestone in understanding the initial stages of planet construction outside our solar system.</p>

          <p>A landmark study has shown that an experimental technique using DNA from three people can successfully prevent children from being born with devastating inherited mitochondrial disorders. British researchers at Newcastle University used the method, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children. The procedure involves transferring the nuclear DNA from a mother's egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the results are hailed as a major breakthrough, the technique remains controversial, with critics raising concerns about safety and the ethics of genetic manipulation.</p>

          <p>President Trump offered a positive assessment of China's efforts to curb the flow of fentanyl, stating that Beijing is "making big steps" on the issue. This contrasts with his previous rhetoric, where he has explicitly used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. The comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs. This shift in tone comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is considering the Genius Act, a bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for the $250 billion market, potentially allowing banks and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins. Supporters argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, positioning them as a more mainstream payment method. The bill is part of a broader Republican push to support and clarify rules for the digital currency sector. (not investment advice)</p>
