          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported the lowest number of monthly border encounters on record for June, with a significant drop in apprehensions at the southern border. The Trump administration attributes this sharp decline to its stringent enforcement policies, highlighting what it calls the "Trump effect" on illegal immigration. While crossings have decreased, the report also notes a substantial increase in seizures of drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine, alongside ongoing tensions and protests surrounding federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced the release of 2,000 California National Guard troops who were federalized and deployed to Los Angeles over a month ago to respond to protests. The deployment, which occurred over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, was initiated by President Trump to address unrest related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions. While the administration claims the mission was successful in subsiding lawlessness, Newsom has called for the remaining troops to also be returned, labeling their continued presence as being political pawns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the National Health Service in England has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) should have their job titles changed to include the word "assistant." The review, commissioned amid debate over their roles, aims to reduce patient confusion and clarify that these positions are distinct from fully qualified doctors. It also suggests standardized uniforms and badges, and states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients, following tragic cases where patients died after being seen by PAs.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has reintroduced the DIGNITY Act, a comprehensive immigration reform bill aimed at creating a pathway to legal status for certain undocumented immigrants. The legislation would establish a seven-year "Dignity Program" for those who have lived in the U.S. for at least five years, allowing them to work legally after passing background checks and paying restitution. The bill's reintroduction comes amid heightened scrutiny of the Trump administration's mass deportation program and aims to provide a legislative solution beyond the choice of amnesty or deportation.</p>

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an ambitious five-year renovation project costing £50 million. The extensive makeover is necessary to repair the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure, which has suffered from the hot, humid conditions required for its tropical rainforest collection. The project will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and transitioning the building to net-zero emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for the popular non-alcoholic beverage 'Trip' for making unauthorized health claims. The watchdog found that the ad improperly suggested the drink could help consumers feel calm and reduce stress, which is not a permitted claim for food or drink ingredients under current regulations. The ASA ruled that the language used, such as "crafted for calm," misleadingly implied a medicinal benefit for anxiety, and told the company not to make such claims in the future.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia that will lower a threatened 32% U.S. tariff on Indonesian goods to 19%. In exchange, Indonesia has reportedly agreed to provide "full access" for American firms by reducing its own tariffs on U.S. products and making significant purchases of American energy and goods. This deal is one of the latest to be reached after the White House issued tariff threats to numerous countries, escalating global trade talks and creating uncertainty in international markets.

The retrial, occurring 46 years after the event, re-examines a pivotal moment in the nation's history and forces a modern reflection on the legacies of both the authoritarian president and the man who killed him.</p>

The administration had planned to terminate the protections, arguing the program is not meant to be permanent and that conditions in Afghanistan have improved. Advocacy groups, who sued the government, celebrated the brief pause, arguing that revoking TPS would betray promises and force families who fled Taliban persecution to uproot their lives from the U.S.</p>
