          <p>Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the movie "Rust," has been released from prison 13 months after being convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April 2024 and has been paroled to Arizona through May 2026, subject to conditions including electronic monitoring and employment or school enrollment. Gutierrez-Reed received the maximum penalty for her role in the tragedy, where actor Alec Baldwin discharged live rounds from a prop gun, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter charge was dismissed after accusations of withheld evidence. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced what appeared to be a go-ahead for a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, a deal previously blocked by the Biden administration on national security grounds.

Investors cheered the plan, causing shares of U.S. Steel to jump more than 21 percent.

          <p>Eight people have been found guilty after US reality TV star Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint of millions of dollars' worth of jewellery in Paris nearly a decade ago. The four who took part in the heist were given sentences of up to eight years, mostly suspended, and they will not return to prison because of time served. Nine men and one woman were accused of carrying out or aiding the armed burglary of $10m (¬£7.55m) worth of jewellery, including a diamond engagement ring, during Paris Fashion Week in 2016. "The crime was the most terrifying experience of my life, leaving a lasting impact on me and my family," Kardashian said in a statement after the verdicts. </p>
