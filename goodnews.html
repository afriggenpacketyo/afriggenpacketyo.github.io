        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days, signaling a thaw in trade tensions. The U.S. administration, under President Trump, reduced tariffs imposed on the Asian economy to 30% from 145%, while China lowered its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10% from 125%. Both countries will retain a portion of their tariffs, with further negotiations planned during the 90-day pause, and have agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to address mutual concerns. The article notes Trump's remarks about a "breakthrough agreement" and the upcoming bilateral talks aimed at solidifying the future trade relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 00:35:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have documented wild chimpanzees in Uganda utilizing medicinal plants in various ways to treat open wounds and injuries. Researchers from the University of Oxford, in collaboration with a local team, filmed and recorded instances of chimpanzees applying plants for first aid, both on themselves and on each other. This research expands on previous findings that chimps consume specific plants for self-medication. The scientists also compiled decades of observations to create a catalog of the different ways in which chimpanzees use "forest first aid", adding to the evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild, and suggesting the capacity for empathy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as ultra-high-net-worth individuals seek personalized wealth management services, but these offices are struggling to find qualified money managers. The article highlights that trust is a key criterion for family offices when hiring, often outweighing other qualifications. Family offices also face competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds for top talent. Some young employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of a clear corporate structure and the perception that they are "risky" or "retirement" jobs, so family offices must step up their game to pursue the talent they want.</p>

          <p>Several UK newspapers are leading with the release of Peter Sullivan, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1986 and spent 38 years in jail before new DNA evidence cleared him. The newspapers also highlight research into new weight-loss drugs, specifically GLP-1 agonists, which have shown potential in reducing deaths from strokes and heart attacks. Counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, considering the possibility of a hostile state involvement, and Ukrainian President Zelensky stated that Putin is the obstacle to a peace deal.</p>

          <p>In negotiations with American representatives, Iranian officials proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments, as an alternative to dismantling its nuclear program. According to Iranian officials, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. While the idea is new and untested, analysts suggest it may be a necessary shift from maximum zero-sum demands to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.</p>
