          <p>President Trump took a gamble by involving the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran, but it may have resulted in a ceasefire. While neither Israel nor Iran has confirmed the agreement, White House officials are touting it as a diplomatic achievement. This development follows Iranian missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar, which caused no casualties or damage. Trump warned of an overwhelming American response to any Iranian attacks, but now seeks peace. </p>
