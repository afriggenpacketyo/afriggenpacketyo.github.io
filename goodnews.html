          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, a predominantly Black infantry regiment celebrated for their valor in World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. The honor recognizes the 369th Infantry Regiment's distinguished service fighting alongside French forces, a necessity at the time due to the segregated U.S. military's refusal to let them serve with white soldiers. This long-overdue recognition comes at a time of national debate over how American history is taught and remembered, with some historians noting the irony of the award being presented during an administration reviewing museum content to ensure it aligns with "American exceptionalism."</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the U.S. government has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, becoming its largest single shareholder. This action, driven by strategic competition with China and the race for AI dominance, converts billions of dollars in grants from the CHIPS Act into ownership. The goal is to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC, particularly amid geopolitical risks, and ensure a secure supply of cutting-edge microchips for national security and critical industries. While not granting governance rights, the significant government involvement raises questions about potential political pressure on the company's business decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that for a new, multipolar world order to emerge, political declarations from groups like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) must be backed by the creation of new economic institutions. The author suggests that the recent gathering of Asian powers lacked a foundational agreement similar to the Bretton Woods conference, which established the post-WWII financial system. The SCO, which includes China, Russia, and India and represents 27 nations in total, is positioned to add significant weight to such an initiative, but the West must also engage to prevent further global fragmentation into competing blocs.</p>

          <p>Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a formal coming-of-age ceremony, making him the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As the second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his status has intensified the ongoing debate in Japan over the male-only succession law. With only two male heirs younger than the current emperor, conservatives are pushing to maintain the tradition, while public support grows for allowing female members, like the emperor's daughter Princess Aiko, to ascend the throne to ensure the monarchy's future.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. The centennial occurs amid political pressure from Germany's far-right AfD party, which has criticized the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity" and sought to prevent its "glorification," echoing the Nazi party's denunciation of Bauhaus as "degenerate art" before shutting it down in 1933. The foundation's director expressed concern about the party's cultural attacks but noted that, unlike in the 1930s, the institution now enjoys widespread public support.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts their journey of becoming a devoted Buffalo Bills fan despite having no prior interest in sports, initiated through their relationship with a Buffalonian partner. The piece explores how the team embodies the spirit of the city of Buffalo—resilient, hardworking, and often an underdog—and how rooting for the team fosters a powerful sense of community and shared identity. The author reflects on how this adopted allegiance has provided a feeling of home and connection, even after moving abroad, demonstrating that team loyalty can be gifted and embraced.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The package would grant him up to 12% of the company's stock over a decade, contingent on meeting extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing Tesla's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion by 2035. Analysts view the proposal, which requires shareholder approval, as a powerful incentive to retain Musk and ensure his focus remains on transforming Tesla into a dominant AI and robotics company.

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper Rene Higuita performed the legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium. The audacious maneuver, where he cleared the ball by diving forward and kicking it with his heels over his back, cemented his legacy as one of football's most flamboyant and eccentric characters. Known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), Higuita was a pioneer of the 'sweeper-keeper' role, famous for his risk-taking style, goal-scoring abilities, and a career that was as controversial as it was brilliant.</p>

The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating that it would force individuals back to dangerous situations, and found that she had exceeded her authority in revoking the protections.</p>
