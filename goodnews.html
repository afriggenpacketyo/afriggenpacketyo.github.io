          <p>The Dalai Lama has announced that the institution will continue after his death, confirming that a successor will be chosen through the traditional reincarnation process. This decision reverses previous speculation that he might be the final person to hold the title. He emphasized that the process should follow past Buddhist traditions and be managed by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, signaling that China should not interfere. The Chinese government maintains that it has the sole authority to approve the next leader, setting the stage for potential conflict over the selection of the 15th Dalai Lama.</p>

          <p>British tennis has seen contrasting fortunes at Wimbledon, with Sonay Kartal advancing while Katie Boulter faced a disappointing exit. After a strong first-round win, Boulter, the British number two, lost a lead to fall in three sets to a lower-ranked opponent. In contrast, 23-year-old Kartal has thrived, defeating a seeded player to reach the third round for the first time and enjoying an impressive rise in the rankings over the past year. Kartal's success highlights her rapid development and maturity, as she continues her run in front of a home crowd at the prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>A recent poll from the University of California Irvine indicates that former Vice President Kamala Harris would be the frontrunner in the California gubernatorial race if she chooses to run. The survey shows Harris with 41% support against an unnamed Republican candidate and leading a field of announced candidates with 24% support, despite a large number of undecided voters. Her high name recognition and favorability ratings give her a significant advantage over other contenders, who remain largely unknown to the public. Harris is expected to announce her decision on entering the race by the end of the summer.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a 10-year plan to "fundamentally rewire" the NHS in England by moving more services out of hospitals and into local communities. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the goal is to provide more convenient care and reduce hospital waiting lists by establishing around 200 new neighborhood health centers. These hubs will be staffed by a mix of GPs, nurses, mental health specialists, and other medics, offering services from scans to follow-up appointments. However, nursing unions and medical associations have raised concerns about the plan's feasibility without a clear strategy for funding and staffing.</p>

The project also includes renovating the adjacent two-story Spanish-style pool house and improving accessibility. While the plan means the community will be without the pool for several more years, with completion slated for 2028, local advocates are relieved that the beloved facility is finally set to be rebuilt for year-round use.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Los Angeles must adopt a more effective strategy to combat the widespread use of illegal fireworks, which pose significant risks of fire, injury, and pollution. The author, from the public safety organization MySafe:LA, suggests the city follow the example of Riverside, which uses surveillance drones to capture violations in real time and mail citations to offenders. This technology-driven approach could increase deterrence and accountability without straining emergency responders. The piece urges the City Council to implement a similar system with higher fines, especially with the upcoming World Cup and Olympics increasing fire risk.</p>

This level of security surpassed modern greats like Alastair Cook, Joe Root, and Steve Smith.
