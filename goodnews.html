          <p>U.S. airlines are aggressively competing for international business-class customers by introducing upgraded suites and enhanced amenities. American Airlines is launching new business-class suites with sliding doors and wireless charging, while United Airlines is introducing "Polaris Studio" seats with ottomans and larger 4K screens. This trend reflects airlines' strategies to attract high-paying customers amid weaker demand for lower-priced tickets. The upgrades are aimed at providing a more luxurious experience and attracting corporate clients who may not be permitted to purchase first-class tickets, but the upgrades may not come cheap for customers.</p>

          <p>Former Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams has been awarded ‚Ç¨100,000 in damages after winning a libel case against the BBC over a 2016 BBC NI Spotlight program and online article. The court found that Mr. Adams was defamed by allegations that he sanctioned the 2006 murder of Denis Donaldson, a claim Adams denies. The BBC argued it was fair and reasonable reporting on a matter of public interest, but the jury found the BBC did not report the allegations in good faith. Adams stated the case was about holding the BBC accountable and criticized its alignment with the British state in Ireland, while the Donaldson family called for a public inquiry into the murder.</p>

          <p>Shakira, Jason Aldean, and Brooks & Dunn had their scheduled concerts at Boston's Fenway Park abruptly canceled due to concerns about the structural integrity of the stage. Live Nation announced the cancellations after a pre-show check revealed that structural elements were not up to standard, and Boston Inspectorial Services found the staging to be structurally unsound. The cancellations impacted fans who had already gathered outside the stadium, with some expressing disappointment after traveling from out of state to attend the shows.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued inflation in April, with the personal consumption expenditures price index increasing only slightly. This has led the Federal Reserve to hold off on interest rate cuts until they have more clarity about President Trump's policies. The report also indicated that consumer spending slowed down, reflecting a more cautious economic mood. The Fed is closely watching these economic indicators to determine the future course of monetary policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk appeared together in the Oval Office as Musk concluded his tenure as a "special government employee." Musk, who led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), thanked Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Despite initial promises of significant budget cuts, DOGE's savings fell short of expectations, and some analyses suggest its actions may have cost the government money. Musk's departure marks a return to the private sector, though he will continue to advise the president.</p>

Kell Morris's wife, a retired Alaska State Trooper, held his head above water while waiting for rescuers. A sled dog tourism company overheard the 911 dispatch and offered their helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. It took seven men and inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off Morris, who sustained only minor injuries. Morris credits his survival to his wife's quick thinking and a series of fortunate events.</p>

Despite the positive financial results, Costco leaders acknowledged challenges related to tariffs, which have led to higher costs and supply chain adjustments. The company is working to mitigate the impact of tariffs by rerouting goods, sourcing more private-label items domestically, and negotiating prices with suppliers. Costco is trying to maintain competitive prices and attract customers through its membership model, discounted gas, and bulk discounts.</p>

Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism and are developing gene therapies that could improve the lives of those with profound autism.

          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Donald Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs has been hailed as a victory for the separation of powers and the rule of law. The court found that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The decision emphasized that the Constitution assigns Congress the exclusive power to impose taxes and regulate foreign commerce. The ruling blocks the IEEPA tariffs nationwide, but the administration has appealed the decision.</p>
