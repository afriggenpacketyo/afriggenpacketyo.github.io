          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old conservative, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hard-line conservative views and hawkish stance on China. Her victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after significant election losses under its previous leader, Shigeru Ishiba. Takaichi's leadership will be tested by domestic economic challenges and the need to navigate complex international relations, particularly with the United States and neighboring Asian countries.</p>

          <p>One month before Election Day 2025, gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia are being closely watched as early indicators of public sentiment toward President Donald Trump's second term. In New Jersey, Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are clashing over Trump's influence and the federal government shutdown. Virginia's historic race will see either Republican Winsome Earle-Sears or Democrat Abigail Spanberger become the state's first female governor. Other key contests include New York City's mayoral election, a contentious redistricting proposition in California, and crucial state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania that could shift the court's ideological balance.</p>

          <p>Scientists analyzing the first-ever rock samples from the far side of the moon, collected by China's Chang'e-6 mission, have discovered a significant thermal asymmetry between the moon's two hemispheres. The research, conducted by a team from China and the UK, indicates that minerals from the far side likely formed in interior lava that was about 100 degrees Celsius cooler than on the near side. This finding provides crucial new data for understanding the moon's formation and evolutionary processes. The stark differences in topography, crustal structure, and volcanic activity between the two sides have long been a subject of scientific inquiry, previously limited by the lack of physical samples.</p>

The article explains how this adjustment would impact retirees of different age groups, from 62 to 80, based on current benefit data from the Social Security Administration. It also notes the general trend of higher benefits for those who delay claiming until age 70 and the subsequent decrease for older retirees due to historical wage differences. The analysis provides a table showing the potential financial impact on average monthly payments for different age brackets. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A controversial new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The team's analysis, published in the journal Antiquity, points to stylistic similarities with mythical Chinese beasts and uses lead isotope testing to trace the statue's copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the 2.8-tonne object could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form. However, some scholars in China are expressing skepticism about this theory.</p>

          <p>The life of pioneering MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr is the subject of a new film, "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The movie, directed by Benny Safdie, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that chronicled Kerr's dominance in the sport as well as his severe addiction to opioids. After years of personal and professional struggles, including job-hopping and alcoholism, Kerr is now sober and has found a second act through his involvement with the film. Johnson, who has been a long-time admirer of Kerr's story, received a 16-minute standing ovation for his portrayal at the Venice Film Festival.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an audacious endurance project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The project, called "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling over 3,000 miles between peaks across six states and then running up each one. This effort is the latest in a series of personal challenges for Jornet, who has shifted his focus from competitive racing to exploring the limits of human endurance and connecting with natural landscapes. His approach emphasized finding "the most aesthetic line" through the mountains, often choosing more difficult and scenic traverses over direct routes to connect the summits.</p>

          <p>The BBC documentary "Premier Passions" offered an unprecedented, behind-the-scenes look at Sunderland's dramatic 1996-97 season, which ended in relegation from the Premier League. The series became famous for its raw depiction of dressing room dynamics, including manager Peter Reid's expletive-laden team talks, and chronicled the club's transition as it prepared to leave its historic Roker Park ground. At a time when the Premier League's commercial power was exploding, the documentary captured the tension between football's traditions and its modernizing future. Those involved reflect on the production as a historic document that, despite the team's on-field heartache, helped grow the club's profile and fanbase.</p>
