          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 14:30:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the returns on high-yield savings accounts have decreased from their recent peaks, though they remain significantly more profitable than traditional savings accounts. Currently, rates in the 4.20% to 4.30% range are considered good, offering a substantial advantage over the average 0.40% from standard accounts without the withdrawal restrictions of CDs. The article suggests that while the era of peak returns may be ending, these accounts still present a competitive option for savers looking to earn interest while maintaining liquidity.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, could conclude in the coming months. Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that the Fed is approaching its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks and is monitoring signs of tightening liquidity conditions. While he offered no new guidance on future interest rate cuts, he reiterated concerns about a softening labor market and the rising downside risks to employment, maintaining a cautious stance amidst the ongoing government shutdown's impact on economic data.

The move is part of Walmart's broader investment in artificial intelligence, positioning it to compete with other e-commerce giants like Amazon, which is also developing its own AI-driven purchasing tools.

          <p>Maggie Kang, co-director of the Netflix animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters," has expressed interest in exploring more stories within the film's universe, but strictly in animated form. In a recent interview, Kang and co-director Chris Appelhans stated that a live-action adaptation would not work, as the unique comedic tone and exaggerated action are best suited for animation. While no sequel is officially in development, they assured fans that any continuation would be a story that deserves to be told. The movie has been a massive success, breaking records on Netflix and music charts since its debut.</p>

          <p>Former player Kevin Muscat is reportedly the leading candidate to become the new manager of Scottish football club Rangers, following the departure of Russell Martin.

If appointed, Muscat would likely not be available until the conclusion of the Chinese league season in late November, potentially requiring an interim manager.

A new partnership with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators marks a significant pivot towards vertical integration, aiming for greater efficiency and performance. This strategy, combined with major deals with Nvidia and AMD and the acquisition of Jony Ive's design firm, positions OpenAI to build a complete AI platform akin to Apple's control over smartphones. The company's goal is to create an integrated system from the silicon up to the end-user application, solidifying its market dominance.</p>

          <p>Following a brief appearance alongside Donald Trump during the Gaza ceasefire announcement in Egypt, UK Labour leader Keir Starmer addressed the House of Commons with a more pragmatic and nuanced perspective. While acknowledging Trump's role, Starmer emphasized that the ceasefire is merely a fragile first step and that achieving a permanent peace will be a long and difficult process. He highlighted Britain's behind-the-scenes support for the peace process and its experience with decommissioning from the Good Friday agreement. His cautious tone contrasted with the more partisan response from his Conservative counterpart, Kemi Badenoch.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. The massive sum was awarded to the families of the victims by a Connecticut jury and judge in 2022 as compensation for the harassment and emotional distress they endured due to his lies. Jones had argued that the judgment, which his lawyers claim can never be paid, violated his free speech rights, but the high court's decision effectively ends his legal challenges in the case.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a climate of falling interest rates, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have become a more affordable borrowing option, with average rates now below 8%. This makes them significantly cheaper than many personal loans and credit cards. The article explains that a "good" HELOC rate is currently around 7.84% or lower, but this benchmark is expected to change as the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting cycle. To secure a low rate, homeowners are advised to maintain a good credit score, shop around with various lenders, and ensure a reasonable debt-to-income ratio. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With current average interest rates, a $15,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) would have an approximate monthly payment of $181 for a 10-year term or $142 for a 15-year term. The article notes that these costs are lower than in previous months due to falling rates and are likely to decrease further. A smaller HELOC can be a manageable way to access funds without significantly reducing home equity, and the initial draw period often requires only interest-only payments, further lowering the initial monthly cost. This makes it a potentially attractive option for homeowners needing a modest amount of capital. (not investment advice)</p>
