        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Burberry revealed plans to cut approximately 1,700 jobs globally as part of a larger cost-saving initiative aimed at revitalizing the luxury brand. These measures, expected to be completed by 2027, include cost reductions in procurement and real estate, projecting savings of ¬£60 million. This follows an earlier ¬£40 million cost-cutting phase, bringing total estimated savings to ¬£100 million. Despite sales declines in all regions, particularly Asia-Pacific, CEO Joshua Schulman expressed optimism about Burberry's future, emphasizing the company's diversification and ability to adapt to geopolitical tensions and tariff impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and China have tentatively eased trade tensions by agreeing to reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days while negotiating trade policy, marking a significant shift from earlier escalations. This agreement reflects a new understanding of "mutual respect" between the two nations, according to U.S. officials, though businesses remain wary of ongoing tariff uncertainty. China simultaneously announced strengthened export controls on critical minerals and emphasized self-reliance, signaling a continued focus on diversifying its trade relationships. Despite the temporary tariff reprieve, analysts caution that the U.S. remains on the offensive, and businesses must adapt to a landscape where the post-World War II trade framework is no longer guaranteed.</p>

          <p>The European Union's second-highest court ruled that the bloc should have released text messages exchanged between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla during negotiations for Covid-19 vaccines.

The court stated that the commission failed to provide credible explanations for not retaining and disclosing the messages, raising questions about transparency and accountability in public policy negotiations.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness. This decision marks a significant shift in U.S. policy, as Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011. The move comes after the Assad regime was toppled in 2024, and the country is now led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, who heads a transitional government. The removal of sanctions is expected to facilitate humanitarian aid and economic progress, which had been hindered by the restrictions.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post discussing vaping in airplane bathrooms has ignited a debate about onboard actions and the ability of passengers to evade detection. Flight attendants and other users claim that sensors throughout the plane can detect smoke or particulates, triggering alarms in the cockpit. Some commenters suggest using nicotine gum instead, while others recount instances of passengers vaping discreetly in their seats without intervention. Experts note that modern smoke detectors can detect aerosols from vaping, and the FAA prohibits vaping under the same rules as cigarette smoking.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading after the company announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) and reported better-than-expected operating income for the last quarter.

Despite these positive developments, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster.

          <p>President Donald Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and a general hostility toward renewable energy, are creating uncertainty and challenges for the clean energy sector in the U.S. While the Inflation Reduction Act provided significant incentives for clean energy development, Trump's actions have led to project cancellations and concerns about the future trajectory of clean tech. Tariffs on imports, particularly from Southeast Asia, could increase costs for renewable energy projects, potentially impacting affordability for consumers. Despite these headwinds, experts predict that the clean energy sector will continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace, as countries globally move away from fossil fuels.</p>

Trust is a key criterion for family offices, often outweighing other qualifications.

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils is challenging the idea that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting there were icy interludes in the dinosaurs' greenhouse. Scientists found that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes similar to today. The presence of polar ice during that time offers insights into current climate change, particularly the potential for continued reductions in Arctic and Antarctic ice. The findings highlight a transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice, impacting the planet's reflectivity.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The proposal was made by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and then shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from representatives from various countries. While the proposal is new and untested, it aims to address concerns about Iran's nuclear program and promote regional stability.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024, but prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs declined to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite the decline, the April average price was still significantly higher than the same month a year ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing $1 billion to help farmers improve biosecurity measures, and the U.S. has increased egg imports to stabilize the supply.</p>

          <p>British astronaut Rosemary Coogan is undergoing rigorous training at NASA's Johnson Space Center, preparing for a potential mission to the International Space Station by 2030. Her training includes spacewalk simulations in the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, which mimics weightlessness. Coogan is also learning about all aspects of space travel, including using the onboard toilet and managing resources. With NASA planning a return to the Moon through the Artemis program, Coogan may have the opportunity to become the first Briton to walk on the Moon.</p>
