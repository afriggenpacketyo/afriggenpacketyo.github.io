          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record high, climbing above $113,000 as investors showed increased appetite for risk assets and short sellers were forced to liquidate their positions. The rally was broad, with other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana also experiencing gains. According to data from CoinGlass, over $318 million in short positions were liquidated in a 24-hour period, a market dynamic that further fuels price increases. The upward trend is also supported by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds and large-scale purchases by public companies, which have helped maintain the cryptocurrency's price above the $100,000 mark for over two months.

          <p>During French President Emmanuel Macron's visit to London, France and the United Kingdom finalized several key agreements, including a new joint migration deal. The "one in, one out" pilot scheme will involve the UK returning undocumented migrants arriving by boat to France, while accepting an equal number of legitimate asylum seekers with family ties to Britain. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the plan aims to deter dangerous Channel crossings. The leaders also pledged to order more Storm Shadow cruise missiles for Ukraine and Macron advocated for a joint recognition of a Palestinian state to promote peace in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>NASA has released stunning new images from the James Webb Space Telescope, captured to celebrate the telescope's third anniversary. The images focus on a region of the Cat's Paw Nebula, located about 4,000 light-years from Earth, revealing an active star-forming area in unprecedented detail. The telescope's Near-Infrared Camera pierced through cosmic gas and dust to show young, yellow-hued stars carving out their environment and emitting bright blue light. The images also highlight glowing red areas where star formation is actively underway, providing new insights into the lifecycle of stars and the evolution of the universe.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Highlight Key Mistakes to Avoid with CD Accounts This Summer</h2>

          <p>As the economic landscape shifts with anticipated interest rate cuts, savers are advised to be more strategic with their Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. This article outlines three common mistakes to avoid this summer to maximize returns. These include incorrectly assuming CD rates will only change after official Federal Reserve action, becoming distracted by higher short-term rates at the expense of long-term stability, and failing to calculate the full interest-earning potential before making a deposit. With rate changes imminent, locking in a favorable long-term rate now could be more beneficial than waiting or opting for a short-term, high-rate CD that will mature in a less favorable environment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A White House request to rescind $9.4 billion in federal spending, including $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), is facing resistance in the Senate. Several Republican senators have expressed concern that the cuts would harm rural radio and television stations, which often serve as the sole source of local news and emergency alerts. Senators from states like South Dakota, Montana, and Alaska argue these stations are lifelines for their communities, particularly for Native American tribes. While the administration has targeted NPR and PBS for allegedly spreading "woke propaganda," lawmakers are now considering amendments to protect these essential rural broadcasters before a final vote.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines' stock jumped over 12% after the company reinstated its 2025 profit outlook and projected a stronger-than-expected summer travel season. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while bookings had stabilized after a dip earlier in the year, the full-year earnings forecast is now set at $5.25 to $6.25 a share, down from an earlier, more optimistic prediction. The airline reported strong second-quarter revenue from premium seats and its American Express partnership, which helped offset a decline in main cabin sales. The positive report boosted shares of other airlines as well, signaling renewed investor confidence in the travel sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial annuities can serve as more than just a supplementary income stream in retirement; they can also strategically influence how retirees utilize their Social Security benefits. By providing a guaranteed income, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security until age 70, which significantly boosts their monthly payments for life. Furthermore, annuity payments can create a stable income "floor," helping to manage budgets and cover essential expenses not fully met by Social Security. A well-structured annuity may also offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income and preserving more wealth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will use its upcoming All-Star Game in Atlanta to test the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System, marking another step toward its potential regular-season implementation. Under the system, each team will receive two challenges per game, which can be initiated by the batter, pitcher, or catcher to review a ball or strike call. The Hawk-Eye tracking system will then determine the pitch's location, with the result displayed on the scoreboard. MLB has been testing ABS in the minor leagues since 2021, and a successful trial at the All-Star Game could lead to its adoption for the 2026 season.</p>

The article highlights that these connections explain why many Liberians speak with an American-style accent, which may have been what President Trump noticed during the meeting.</p>
