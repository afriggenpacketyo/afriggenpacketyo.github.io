          <p>A suspect has been charged with attempted kidnapping and stalking after allegedly trespassing at the home of Memphis Mayor Paul Young. Police apprehended 25-year-old Trenton Abston after investigating suspicious activity and discovering he had a Taser, gloves, rope, and duct tape in his car. Surveillance footage showed Abston going directly to the mayor's residence after scaling a wall into the neighborhood. Mayor Young cited recent violence against elected officials and online threats against him and his wife, emphasizing the need to address the link between angry rhetoric and real-life violence, urging for a more loving and unified community.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at William & Mary University discovered a secret cellar beneath the Williamsburg Bray School, the oldest surviving schoolhouse for Black children. The cellar contained artifacts like slate pencil fragments and jewelry, providing new insights into the school's history. The Williamsburg Bray School primarily taught enslaved students in the 1760s, using a religious framework to justify slavery, and was later used as a dormitory for some of the first women to attend college. The excavation also unearthed handmade ceramics associated with enslavement and a shard of glass depicting Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, justice, war, and the arts, highlighting the interwoven history of the city and university.</p>

          <p>The Buss family has reportedly agreed to sell a majority stake in the Los Angeles Lakers to businessman Mark Walter, valuing the team at $10 billion, setting a new record for NBA valuations. Jeanie Buss will retain a minority stake and her governor seat, continuing her involvement with the team her family has owned since 1979. Walter, CEO of Guggenheim Partners, is also the majority owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, WNBA's Sparks, and Cadillac's forthcoming Formula 1 team. Magic Johnson praised the transaction, noting Walter is the right person to carry on the Lakers' legacy, as NBA valuations have surged since the league's latest media rights agreement, with the Lakers finishing the 2025 season as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are causing a rise in the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, prompting homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers of lumber, steel, and aluminum have increased prices, adding approximately $10,000 to the cost of a typical renovation, according to the NAHB. Builder David Perotti recommends pre-ordering materials and focusing on projects like painting to save money, advising clients to budget an additional 30% for tariff-related material costs. He also suggests prioritizing exterior damage repairs to prevent further degradation of the home.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the American Chemical Society have developed a system that could potentially detect Parkinson's disease at an early stage by analyzing the odor of ear wax. The study identified four volatile organic compounds in the sebum of people with Parkinson's that differ from those without the condition. Using these findings, researchers trained an artificial intelligence olfactory system that categorized samples with and without Parkinson's with 94% accuracy. This AI system could serve as a cost-effective screening tool for early detection, though further research is needed across different stages of the disease, multiple research centers, and ethnic groups to determine its broader practical application.</p>

          <p>Public pools are essential for mental, physical, and social well-being, offering mood-boosting exercise and a sense of transcendence. Historically, they served as social hubs, but desegregation led to their decline as some retreated to private clubs. Revitalizing public pools could provide a "third place" for people to meet and connect, counteracting the neglect and underfunding that have plagued these facilities. Investing in public pools would improve the health, happiness, and orderliness of communities, especially during hot summers.</p>

          <p>Wales will ban plastic wet wipes starting in December 2026, becoming the first UK nation to implement such a measure to reduce environmental harm. The ban, which follows a vote in the Senedd, makes it an offense to supply wet wipes containing plastic to consumers, with exemptions for medical-grade wipes and business-to-business supply. The new regulations add plastic wet wipes to a 2023 law prohibiting single-use plastic products, with Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies emphasizing the need to shift towards reusable and non-plastic products. Research from Cardiff University highlighted that wet wipes pose a significant risk to the environment, contributing to sewage blockages and river pollution.</p>
