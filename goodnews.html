          <p>A group of Quakers are marching from New York City to Washington D.C. to protest the current administration's immigration policies. The march is rooted in the Quaker tradition of activism for justice and peace. The protesters seek to show solidarity with migrants and other groups they believe are being unfairly targeted. They plan to deliver a copy of the Flushing Remonstrance, a 17th-century document advocating for religious freedom, to the U.S. Capitol, highlighting the importance of welcoming all.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to end the recruitment of care workers from abroad as part of a broader effort to reduce net migration. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that rules would change to prioritize hiring British nationals or extending visas for existing overseas workers. The government expects these changes to reduce lower-skilled visas by up to 50,000 in the next year. The plan also includes new training requirements to encourage more domestic workers to enter the labor market.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses the declining influence of Elon Musk within the current administration, suggesting his reputation has been damaged due to his unorthodox approach and criticisms of the president's policies. Despite initial support, Musk's actions, such as criticizing cabinet members and undermining the chain of command, led to his marginalization. The article argues that Musk's attempt to operate outside the established system of government ultimately led to his downfall, serving as a cautionary tale about the limits of power for unelected figures.</p>
