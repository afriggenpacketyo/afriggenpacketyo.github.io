          <p>A federal judge has approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by Grant House, permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually. It also includes $2.7 billion for former players who were previously barred from revenue. The agreement brings a seismic shift to hundreds of schools, forcing them to reckon with the reality that their players are the ones producing billions in TV and other revenue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a multibillion-dollar class-action legal settlement known as House v. NCAA, paving the way for a new era for college sports. Starting this fall, colleges and universities in the NCAA's top division will be allowed to directly pay athletes for the first time, capped at $20.5 million per school. The settlement also provides $2.75 billion to former college athletes who were not allowed to earn money while in school. This agreement marks a huge step forward for college sports and is a tremendously positive change that was long overdue.</p>
