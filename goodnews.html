          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly driven by Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to significantly impact the country. This is because most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, relying on a merchanting and processing system where intellectual property is key and manufacturing is contracted out.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice reserves to address soaring rice prices, which have reached near-record highs. This action is being considered due to a rice shortage partly caused by a poor harvest in the summer of 2023 and an increase in rice consumption at restaurants due to more foreign tourists. The government is studying the possibility of releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. To encourage participation in auctions, the government is also considering relaxing the requirement for distributors to buy back the same amount of rice within a year.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling approximately 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential installation defect that may cause a loss of brake function while driving. The front brake lines in the recalled vehicles may come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, potentially leading to a brake fluid leak and reduced braking performance. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning indicator. Ford dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge, with owner notifications scheduled to begin in late May.</p>

          <p>The Independent Schools Council (ISC) reports that the average cost of private school education in the UK has risen by 22.6% in the last year following the introduction of VAT on fees. This increase is higher than government predictions, and the ISC anticipates a decrease in private school applications as a result. The average termly fee for a day school in January was ¬£7,382, including 20% VAT. Parents are already leaving the sector due to the increased costs, with some families finding private education unaffordable due to the tax changes.</p>

Successful entries often sing about personal liberation in English, allude to folk music, and feature elaborate staging with fire. However, dramatic key changes and novelty acts are best avoided. Conchita Wurst's "Rise Like a Phoenix" exemplifies personal empowerment, while Ruslana's "Wild Dances" blends English lyrics with folk elements. The key is to be spectacular and slightly weird, but avoid being overly silly or relying on outdated gimmicks.</p>

          <p>Shao Chun Chen, a former Google employee, now lives in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and 'supercommutes' to Singapore once a week to work as an adjunct lecturer at the National University of Singapore. Chen's three-hour-a-week job teaching a digital marketing class provides him with $2,000 to $4,000 Singapore dollars ($1,540 to $3,070) per month, enough to cover his travels and all of his and his wife's living expenses in Thailand. Chen's financial independence stems from a seven-figure investment portfolio built over a decade, allowing him to pursue a lifestyle with a lower cost of living and more time for personal pursuits.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to support businesses and workers affected by the trade war, with officials from key government departments holding meetings with private sector representatives. The State Administration of Market Regulation (SAMR) met with representatives from major Chinese internet platforms and banks to discuss measures to support the self-employed, who rely on selling goods overseas via online platforms. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) also held a meeting with private sector representatives. The SAMR aims to "stabilize employment, companies, markets and expectations" by helping the self-employed navigate the challenges of the trade war.</p>
