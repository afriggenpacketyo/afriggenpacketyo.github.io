          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese goods, experts predict that Temu and Shein will continue to be major players in the U.S. e-commerce market. These companies are shifting to localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and using local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices on these platforms have increased, analysts believe that Temu and Shein's ability to offer products at significantly lower prices than competitors like Amazon will allow them to remain competitive. Furthermore, their agile supply chains and small-batch production methods enable them to quickly adapt to consumer trends.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced an increase after the company reported a smaller-than-anticipated decline in first-quarter sales and reaffirmed its financial outlook for the year.

CEO Daniel Grieder acknowledged the impact of macroeconomic uncertainty and global trade tensions on consumer sentiment, particularly in China. The company is closely monitoring these developments, including ongoing tariff discussions, but remains confident in achieving its full-year sales targets.</p>

The dismissals, which include high-ranking officers from the Rocket Force, raise concerns about the competence and reliability of China's military commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil suggests that Xi may not fully trust his advisors, potentially weakening his appetite for war.

          <p>Germany is still engaged in the painstaking process of searching for its fallen soldiers from World War II, 80 years after the war's end. The Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgr√§berf√ºrsorge, a nonprofit organization, is dedicated to finding, exhuming, and reburying the remains of German soldiers across Europe. Despite the controversial nature of honoring soldiers who fought for the Nazi regime, the organization focuses on providing a dignified burial to every person who died in the war. The effort underscores the lasting physical and emotional legacy of the conflict.</p>
