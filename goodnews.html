        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Court of International Trade stated that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations, which is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The White House has criticized the ruling and requested the court to block the order suspending tariffs while it appeals the case, and the case could eventually go to the Supreme Court. The ruling was based on two separate cases brought by small businesses and US state governments, challenging Trump's tariffs imposed on most of the US's trading partners.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining current federal funds rates, savers are considering whether to invest in short-term or long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) to maximize returns. Short-term CDs are currently offering higher interest rates compared to long-term CDs, making them an attractive option for those seeking the highest yields. However, long-term CDs can still be useful for those seeking a fixed rate for a longer period, though early withdrawal penalties apply. Experts recommend considering personal financial situations and goals before deciding between short-term and long-term CDs, and suggest using a CD ladder strategy to diversify investments across various maturity dates.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, stating it is not in the public interest for immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling is a reprieve for immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. had been threatened. The judge found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The order affects Ukrainians, Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the U.S. under Biden-era parole policies.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged at the opening of trading on Thursday after a federal court blocked President Donald Trump from imposing tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The ruling from the U.S. Court of International Trade invalidated levies on dozens of countries, but the Trump administration appealed the ruling within minutes, leaving the ultimate fate of the tariffs unclear. The ruling centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court affording the Trump administration up to 10 days to halt the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The United States Court of International Trade struck down almost all of President Trump‚Äôs tariffs, arguing that neither the Constitution nor any statute authorizes the president to impose them. The court‚Äôs ruling included a detailed discussion of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, concluding that the law does not authorize any of Trump‚Äôs tariff orders. The ruling affirms Congress's power over tariffs, as Article I of the Constitution delegates the tariff power to Congress. The court's decision is viewed as a vindication of the rule of law, not a judicial coup.</p>

Cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue, and the company is focusing on the potential for its GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers through AI inference.
