          <p>The 2025 local elections in England saw Reform UK make significant gains, securing control of 10 councils. Both Labour and the Conservatives experienced substantial losses, failing to retain control of any councils they previously held. The Liberal Democrats and Greens also made gains, while mayoral contests presented a mixed outcome. Reform UK's success was particularly notable in former Conservative strongholds, suggesting a shift in voter allegiance and a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' grip on the electorate.
