          <p>President Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. and the United Kingdom have reached a "full and comprehensive" trade agreement. The deal, according to Trump, will solidify the relationship between the two countries for years to come, marking the UK as the first to reach such an agreement with the U.S. after recent tariff announcements. A spokesperson for the U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed ongoing talks and promised an update later in the day, while The New York Times initially reported the impending announcement. The agreement is expected to alleviate some tariff burdens and foster closer economic ties between the U.S. and the U.K.</p>

          <p>An interim report indicates that the root cause of the fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport in March, disrupting hundreds of thousands of journeys, remains undetermined. The fire occurred at a nearby electrical substation, causing a power outage at the airport. The National Energy System Operator's (Neso) report noted that a transformer disconnected and caught fire, but the cause of the incident is still under investigation, with a final report due by the end of June. Heathrow Airport welcomed the findings and hopes the final report will provide answers to prevent future occurrences.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals might be announced this week as his administration faces pressure to finalize agreements before a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs expires. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this timeline, stating that deals could be announced soon, with a "major trade deal" with a "big, highly respected country" expected. The announcement comes amidst ongoing market volatility and fears of a U.S. recession due to recently implemented tariffs. While the administration has not specified which countries are involved, negotiations have been ongoing with Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.</p>

          <p>President Trump briefly announced a 100 percent tariff on movies made outside America, causing immediate concern in Hollywood. Filmmakers feared the move would hurt U.S. filmmaking, leading to a drop in shares for Netflix and other entertainment companies. However, the White House quickly retracted the announcement, stating no tariff would take effect. The article explores the reasons behind Trump's consideration of protectionism for Hollywood, noting the industry's challenges, including the shift of filming locations overseas due to cheaper labor and tax incentives.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will reduce the burden of President Trump's sweeping tariffs. This deal would be a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article explains the science behind mRNA vaccines, addressing concerns about their safety and potential. It details how mRNA, found in all cells, carries information from DNA to build proteins, and how mRNA vaccines use this process to trigger an immune response. The article clarifies that mRNA cannot alter DNA and discusses the use of mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases like COVID-19 and RSV, as well as potential applications in treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, and genetic disorders. The article concludes by emphasizing that mRNA therapy is still a drug technology like any other.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs later. It's thought US President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports will stay, but that the UK will see cuts to the 25% tariffs on some of its biggest exports. What is announced today is likely to be only the bare bones of a narrow agreement. There will be months of negotiations and legal paperwork to follow. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is unknown.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth, possibly on Saturday. The spacecraft, intended to land on Venus, never made it out of Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts estimate the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, with a small chance of impacting someone or something. The spacecraft's landing capsule, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive reentry.</p>

          <p>This commentary suggests that older Americans are increasingly disapproving of President Trump. Issues such as proposed cuts to Social Security and Medicaid, dismantling of federal agencies, and controversial nominees are contributing to this shift. The author argues that older voters, having witnessed the benefits of government programs and historical progress, are more resistant to Trump's policies. Older voters vote in higher numbers than any other age group.</p>
