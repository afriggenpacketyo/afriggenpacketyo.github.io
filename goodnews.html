          <p>Chinese government scientists have reported successful results from a weather modification experiment in Xinjiang, where a fleet of cloud seeding drones increased rainfall by over 4 percent across more than 8,000 sq km in a single day. The operation generated over 70,000 cubic meters of additional precipitation using just 1kg of silver iodide. The test, detailed in a peer-reviewed paper, was led by the CMA‚Äôs key laboratory of cloud-precipitation physics and weather modification in Beijing.</p>

          <p>Romania held a re-run of its presidential election after the original November vote was annulled due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The initial vote saw far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but the election was annulled due to issues with campaign financing and organization. Alleged electoral violations included the spread of pro-Georgescu messaging via social media as part of a Russian hybrid attack. George Simion, a Georgescu ally, is expected to progress to a second-round run-off, while other candidates are running on pro-EU platforms.</p>

          <p>The Canton Fair, China's largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a surge in foreign buyers from around the world, with the notable exception of American buyers, whose presence has diminished due to intensifying tariffs from the US. The fair is adapting to this shift by providing premium service to potential overseas buyers, including multilingual support and a focus on markets beyond the US. This reflects a broader trend of Chinese exporters seeking new markets and reducing their dependence on the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food pouches, arguing that it's another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author acknowledges concerns about the sugar content and nutritional value of these pouches but questions the moral judgment placed on mothers who use them for convenience. She argues that the debate often ignores the social, political, and economic factors at play, such as the time and labor involved in preparing fresh baby food. The author advocates for a society that supports and facilitates good food choices for parents, rather than shaming them.</p>
