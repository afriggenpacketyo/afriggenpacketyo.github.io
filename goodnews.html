          <p>China and Russia are collaborating to construct a nuclear power station on the moon by 2035, which will power the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). This project, seen as a rival to NASA's Artemis Program, aims to establish a permanent lunar base for long-term exploration and scientific research. The ILRS will be located near the lunar south pole and involve numerous international partners, with China inviting many countries and researchers to participate in its "555 Project." The moon's resources, including metal oxides and helium-3, are a key motivation for spacefaring nations.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating proposed changes to a bill that would legalize assisted dying in England and Wales for terminally ill adults expected to die within six months. The debate has sparked clashes among MPs regarding the role of doctors and safeguards to protect vulnerable individuals. Concerns have been raised about potential pressure on individuals to end their lives and the exclusion of medical staff from initiating the discussion about assisted dying with patients. The bill has undergone scrutiny and amendments, with a vote expected to take place in June.</p>

          <p>South Korean shipbuilders might anticipate increased orders due to trade tensions between the US and China, which are causing disruptions in the global shipbuilding sector. However, experts suggest that competition from China will remain fierce. The United States is set to impose higher docking fees on vessels manufactured in China, which could lead to some Chinese shipbuilders losing orders to their Korean competitors. Despite these challenges, China remains a dominant force in the shipbuilding industry.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime scene‚Äîbloody, bare footprints‚Äîeventually led to the conviction of Jerry Westrom for the murder of Jeanie Childs.

Decades later, DNA evidence from the crime scene was linked to Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Ultimately, forensic analysis confirmed that the bloody footprints at the scene matched Westrom, leading to his arrest and conviction despite his denial of knowing the victim.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the anxiety many people, especially women, experience when inviting friends over due to the pressure to have a perfectly clean home. Experts suggest the only rule to follow is to ensure the house is tidy enough for guests to relax, focusing on the comfort of the gathering space rather than striving for perfection. The piece also addresses the tendency to compare homes to idealized images on social media and the importance of suspending judgment about others' living spaces. The key takeaway is to prioritize spending quality time with friends over maintaining an immaculate house.</p>
