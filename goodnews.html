          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, marking the steepest decline since September 2024, though the decrease was less severe than economists had anticipated. This downturn follows a 2% gain in April and comes after the Bank of Japan cautioned about a potential moderation in the country's growth due to trade-related factors. The decline in exports has already impacted Japan's GDP, which contracted by 0.2% in the quarter ending March. Amidst these economic concerns, trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S. remain unresolved, with Japan facing potential tariff increases if a deal is not reached by July 9.

          <p>China is leading the world in repurposing decommissioned coal mines into solar power projects, a trend that could boost the clean energy transition and alleviate a surplus of solar panels from Chinese manufacturers. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), 90 former coal mines in mainland China are now operating as solar-power facilities, with an additional 46 projects in the planning stages. This initiative offers a way to restore land, create local jobs, and deploy clean energy, with other countries like Australia, the US, and Greece also exploring similar conversion projects.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passports. The ruling allows individuals renewing passports or changing their name or sex designation to choose their identified gender, including selecting "X" on the application form. This decision expands upon an earlier ruling in April and addresses a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which claimed the policy was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals.

          <p>Texas has ceased providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, reversing course after completing only 65 miles of the project. The decision follows a new budget approved by state lawmakers that excludes further funding for the wall, which had been a priority for Governor Greg Abbott.
