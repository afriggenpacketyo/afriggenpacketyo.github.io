          <p>Canada has committed to meeting NATO's defense spending target of 2% of GDP within a year, significantly earlier than previously planned. Prime Minister Mark Carney announced this military buildup, which includes investments in submarines, aircraft, and ships, citing the need to address multiplying threats from hostile governments, terrorist entities, and cyber criminals. Carney criticized Canada's over-reliance on the United States for defense, noting Washington's reduction in its contribution to collective security. The new strategy will focus on investing in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defense industry, and diversifying defense partnerships. </p>

          <p>Dell Technologies has pledged to contribute $1,000 to "Trump accounts" for new children of its employees, matching the government's proposed contribution to the savings program for newborns. CEO Michael Dell made this commitment during a White House roundtable event with President Donald Trump, who is promoting the savings account plan as part of a Republican-backed budget bill. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi and Goldman Sachs chief David Solomon also expressed support for the initiative, but did not make the same financial commitment. The program, which would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, faces pushback in the Senate.

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Merck's RSV shot, Enflonsia, designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus during their first season. This approval introduces a rival to Sanofi and AstraZeneca's similar treatment, Beyfortus, which experienced supply shortages during the previous RSV season. Enflonsia, a preventative monoclonal antibody, offers doctors a new option for tackling the virus, a leading cause of hospitalization among newborns. Merck anticipates orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the RSV season starts. Sanofi has announced efforts to increase Beyfortus supply, including early shipping in the third quarter.</p>

          <p>The global transition to clean energy is heavily dependent on a handful of elements and minerals known as "critical minerals." These minerals, including lithium, cobalt, and copper, are essential for producing, storing, and transmitting electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. The demand for these materials is expected to surge as the world races towards cleaner energy solutions. However, the uneven distribution of these minerals and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. The Trump administration has focused on increasing domestic critical mineral production, while international trade tensions have further complicated the supply of these essential resources.</p>
