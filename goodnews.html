        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, buoyed by increasing sales to home improvement professionals, which compensated for a slowdown in demand from do-it-yourself consumers. The company's first-quarter earnings slightly missed sales expectations but exceeded earnings estimates, leading to a rise in Lowe's stock during premarket trading. CEO Marvin Ellison credited the company's investments in stores, technology, and customer service for navigating the current challenges in the housing market. The article notes that both Lowe's and its competitor, Home Depot, are focusing on attracting professional clients to offset weaker sales from individual consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lowe's reported earnings that exceeded expectations, driving the company's stock higher, as the home improvement chain continues to recover from post-pandemic challenges. The article reports that while revenue declined slightly year-over-year, adjusted earnings per share surpassed estimates, and same-store sales fell less than anticipated. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the positive results to strategic investments in technology and store environments. Despite tariff uncertainty and a sluggish housing market, Lowe's reiterated its financial guidance for the year, projecting flat to modest growth in same-store sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's reputation for disregarding public opinion, there are instances where public sentiment appears to influence his administration's actions. The article analyzes Trump's handling of issues like birthright citizenship, deportations, and tariffs, noting cases where he has defied public outcry and others where he has seemingly responded to it. Examples include his administration's compliance with court rulings and his scaling back of tariffs after widespread opposition. The analysis suggests that while Trump's policies are often polarizing, public anger can still sway his administration's priorities, particularly on issues with lasting political implications.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed the first detection of West Nile virus in UK mosquitoes, although no human cases acquired within the UK have been reported to date. The virus fragments were found in Aedes vexans mosquitoes collected in Britain in 2023 as part of a research program. Officials emphasize that the risk to the general public remains very low but are issuing guidance to healthcare professionals. This discovery highlights the changing landscape of mosquito-borne diseases due to climate change, which may introduce non-native species and infectious diseases to the UK.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has affirmed the legal right to wild camping on Dartmoor, rejecting an appeal by landowners who sought to restrict public access. The judges ruled that the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act, granting the public access for ‚Äúopen-air recreation,‚Äù includes camping. This decision is likely to reignite the debate over public access to land in England, where Dartmoor National Park is a rare exception to the general lack of wild camping rights. Campaigners and organizations have celebrated the ruling and are calling for an extension of wild camping rights to other parts of England.</p>
