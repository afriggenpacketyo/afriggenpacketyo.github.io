          <h2>UK to Implement Stricter Affordability Checks for 'Buy Now, Pay Later' Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 05:32:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting next July, shoppers in the UK using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services will face stricter affordability checks under new regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is introducing these rules to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and unexpected late fees. This means some users may be denied credit, and the process for making purchases could be slowed down. The move aims to bring the rapidly growing, currently unregulated BNPL sector in line with other forms of credit, following concerns from debt charities about the financial risks to consumers.

          <p>A metro train in Shanghai experienced a sudden malfunction on July 14, causing the lights to go out and the train to stop abruptly between stations. According to a statement from the Shanghai Metro, all passengers on board were safely evacuated from the train. They were then guided to the nearest station to continue their journeys. The brief article documents the incident, highlighting the orderly evacuation process following the unexpected technical failure on the city's public transit system, and no injuries were reported.</p>

          <p>Estonia has become a world leader in digitalization, offering nearly all public services online, from tax filing to divorce applications, with over 90% citizen uptake. This success is attributed to user-friendly systems, like a versatile national e-ID, and the 'once-only principle,' where citizens provide data to the government just once. The efficiency gains are significant, with administrative costs for tax collection being just one-sixth of Germany's on a per capita basis. This comprehensive digital transformation offers a model for other nations seeking to modernize and streamline bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>The defeat of 25-year-old Deja Foxx in an Arizona congressional primary highlights the challenges younger candidates face, even as they aim to bring generational change to politics. While some, like New York mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani, have found success with a progressive, anti-establishment playbook, it remains a difficult path. Experts note that winning requires more than a youth-focused message; factors like institutional support, fundraising, and clear policy distinctions from opponents are crucial. Despite some high-profile victories, many young candidates struggle to overcome these systemic hurdles in the current political environment.</p>

          <h2>Netflix Confirms First-Time Use of Generative AI for Visual Effects to Reduce Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix has used generative artificial intelligence to create visual effects in one of its original shows for the first time, according to co-CEO Ted Sarandos. The technology was employed in the Argentine sci-fi series 'The Eternauts' to create a scene of a building collapsing, a task completed ten times faster and at a lower cost than with traditional methods. While Sarandos highlighted the benefits for smaller-budget productions, the use of AI in entertainment remains controversial. The move comes amid ongoing industry debate over AI's potential to replace human jobs and its use of existing work to generate content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government plans to introduce legislation that would lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, potentially adding 1.5 million teenagers to the electorate. This would be the most significant expansion of the franchise since 1969 and would align national election rules with those already in place in Scotland and Wales. The move presents a new challenge for political parties, who must now engage a generation of voters that primarily consumes news through social media platforms. Analysts suggest parties will need to develop authentic digital strategies to appeal to these new voters.</p>

          <p>Swedish defense manufacturer Saab saw its shares jump significantly after reporting second-quarter profits and sales that exceeded market expectations. The company's operating income rose by 49% year-on-year, driven by a broad push across Europe to increase defense spending in an 'era of rearmament.' Saab's CEO noted that activity in the European defense market is extremely high, and the company is ramping up production to meet demand. The stock's performance reflects a larger trend benefiting the European defense industry as NATO members increase their security budgets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States has officially designated The Resistance Front (TRF) as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, holding it responsible for the April attack in Pahalgam, India, that killed 26 people. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the TRF as a proxy for the Pakistan-based, UN-designated terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The move was welcomed by India as a strong affirmation of U.S.-India counterterrorism cooperation. The designation enforces sanctions on the group and is seen as a sign of deepening U.S. support for India following the deadly attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>The recent ban of high-frequency trading firm Jane Street by India's market regulator has brought the gray area between legal arbitrage and illegal market manipulation into sharp focus. Arbitrage involves exploiting price differences across markets, while manipulation involves intentionally distorting prices for unfair gain. Experts suggest the key distinction lies in intent and market impact; creating an artificial price discrepancy to profit from it crosses the line into manipulation. The case alleges the firm deliberately moved India's Nifty 50 index to profit from large options positions. (not investment advice)</p>
