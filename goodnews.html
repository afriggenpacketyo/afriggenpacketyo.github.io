          <p>A new study by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the United States, ranking cities based on factors like unemployment rates, income growth, and work-life balance. Bend, Oregon, secured the top spot due to its low unemployment, significant income growth of 44% since 2020, and short commute times. The report also highlights cities excelling in specific areas, such as Santa Clara, California, for employee health insurance coverage and Frisco, Texas, for the high prevalence of remote work. This analysis provides valuable insights for job-seekers navigating the current economic landscape of slowing hiring nationwide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ken Griffin's hedge fund firm, Citadel, has successfully navigated a volatile market, with all its major funds posting gains in the first half of 2025. The firm's tactical trading fund led the performance with a 6.1% increase, while its largest multistrategy fund, Wellington, gained 2.5%. These positive returns come despite market challenges, including trade policy and geopolitical conflict, and as the S&P 500 itself rose over 5% in the same period. With $66 billion in assets, Citadel's performance highlights its ability to generate profits even amid economic uncertainty and Griffin's own criticism of protectionist trade policies.

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has been officially confirmed as the winner of New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, securing a stunning upset over former Governor Andrew Cuomo. The final ranked-choice vote count showed Mamdani winning by a 12-point margin, cementing a victory that sends shockwaves through the political establishment. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assembly member, ran on a populist platform focused on the cost of living and built an energetic campaign that resonated with voters. He will now face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who is running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa in the November general election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), in an effort to accelerate housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the changes, which exempt most new housing projects built within existing urban areas from the stringent CEQA review process. Proponents argue this will remove bureaucratic hurdles that have been weaponized to block development, while some environmental and social justice groups oppose the move. They fear it will undermine public participation and facilitate industrial projects in low-income neighborhoods without proper oversight.</p>

This record heat follows what the Met Office has provisionally declared as the warmest June on record for England. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for several English regions until Wednesday morning, when temperatures are expected to cool down.

          <p>NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch advises job-seekers to ask one specific question to uncover a company's true values: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" She argues this question cuts through corporate platitudes about innovation and excellence, yielding more honest and revealing answers about the actual work culture. Examples of real responses include warnings against people who are "too social" or those unwilling to text on weekends. By asking this question, preferably after receiving an offer, candidates can better assess if a company's values align with their own, leading to better job satisfaction and retention.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) becoming more favorable, this article highlights four critical mistakes homeowners should avoid this July. These include not monitoring the current rate climate to find the best offers and incorrectly assuming that HELOC rates will perfectly mirror any future Federal Reserve rate cuts. Another key mistake is overborrowing; even with lower rates than personal loans or credit cards, the home serves as collateral, posing a significant risk. Finally, homeowners are advised to use HELOCs for strategic purposes like value-adding renovations rather than for discretionary spending like vacations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers whose certificates of deposit (CDs) are maturing this July, the interest rate landscape has changed significantly from the highs of recent years.

Instead, they should actively shop around for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, before anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts further reduce them. Given the changing environment, the article also suggests considering a long-term CD to lock in today's relatively high rates for several years, provided the funds will not be needed before maturity.
