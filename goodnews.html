The MIND diet emphasizes everyday brain foods such as leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil, which are known to protect brain cells, improve memory, and reduce inflammation. Even small improvements to diet over time were linked to an average 9% drop in dementia risk. The article provides tips on how to incorporate these foods into your daily meals.</p>

The report highlights the complexity of Britain's fare system and calls for rail firms to stop taking disproportionate action against travelers. The ORR cited cases where passengers were threatened with court action for accidental errors. Rail Minister Lord Peter Hendy acknowledged that ham-fisted prosecutions were punishing innocent passengers and that the government plans to simplify ticketing to tackle fare-dodging.</p>

          <p>Three former Salvadoran military officers have been convicted for the 1982 killings of four Dutch TV journalists during El Salvador's civil war. The officers received 15-year prison sentences after a jury found them guilty of murder. The case was reopened in 2018 after the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a general amnesty passed following the war. The Dutch journalists were ambushed and killed by Salvadoran soldiers while reporting behind rebel lines. The trial was closed to the public, but the convictions have been hailed as an important step in the fight against impunity.</p>
