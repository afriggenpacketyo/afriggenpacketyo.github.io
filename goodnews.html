          <p>Marco Rubio, already serving as Secretary of State and acting administrator of USAID, has been appointed interim National Security Advisor, raising concerns about his capacity to effectively manage all responsibilities. The New York Times article highlights the unprecedented nature of Rubio holding four high-level positions simultaneously, drawing comparisons to Henry Kissinger's dual roles in the past. The article raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and the practical challenges of juggling multiple agencies, particularly under a president known for unconventional governance.

The article explains that Border Patrol recorded approximately 8,400 apprehensions, consistent with the previous two months, representing a significant decrease compared to the Biden administration. The Trump administration attributes the drop to its policies, including rapid deportations, increased troop deployment, and dismantling of Biden-era programs.
