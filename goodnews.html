          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," offers a dramatic portrayal of the life of pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr, with Dwayne Johnson in the lead role. The movie explores Kerr's crisis after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse, relationship turmoil, and the existential dread of no longer being invincible. While the article notes the film doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the story, it praises Johnson's powerful and vulnerable performance, supported by a strong turn from Emily Blunt as his girlfriend, Dawn.</p>

The 25th seed triumphed 7-5 6-3 6-4 on Arthur Ashe Stadium, marking his first appearance in the tournament's last eight since his 2021 semi-final run. Overcoming a poor head-to-head record against Rublev, Auger-Aliassime's dominant performance, featuring 42 winners, sets up a compelling quarter-final match against Australia's Alex de Minaur.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has warned his team against complacency, stating that their upcoming defense at Bethpage will require a different strategy than their 2023 victory in Rome. Despite confirming a team with 11 of the 12 players from the previous win, Donald emphasized that playing on American soil presents a unique challenge, particularly with a hostile crowd. He stressed that he will not simply "rinse and repeat" pairings and lineups, and that players must be prepared to embrace the pressurized atmosphere to succeed.</p>

          <h2>Margaret Atwood Criticizes Alberta Book Ban with Satirical Short Story</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:21:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta, which has led to her iconic novel "The Handmaid's Tale" being removed from some school libraries. The provincial government ordered schools to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," a move that has impacted numerous literary classics. Atwood's new story sarcastically describes perfectly chaste characters who reproduce without sex, directly mocking the policy and its supporters, including Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, in a creative defense of literary freedom.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains on Monday, led by a surge in the defense sector after the United Kingdom announced a £10 billion warship export deal with Norway. Shares of BAE Systems, which will build the Type 26 frigates, rose significantly, boosting the broader Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index. The health-care sector also performed well, with Novo Nordisk shares climbing after new trial data suggested its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective at reducing heart disease risk than its main rival, Zepbound.

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Influence Caused Divergence in Animal Size Evolution in Middle Ages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier has found that human activities during the Middle Ages caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones from southern France discovered that while both groups previously followed similar size cycles, a split occurred around 1000 AD. As human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like deer and foxes shrank, while selective breeding and controlled management led to an increase in the size of domestic animals like cattle and chickens.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's nationalized rail operator, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, a move that significantly lowers costs for commuters and raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could follow. The policy aims to encourage more train travel, leveraging post-pandemic changes in commuting patterns that have left more capacity on rush-hour services. While passengers welcome cheaper tickets, experts are divided, with some warning that without government investment to increase capacity on busy English routes, a similar move there could lead to severe overcrowding or necessitate overall price hikes.</p>
