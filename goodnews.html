        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has achieved unprecedented success, becoming Netflix's most-viewed film ever, surpassing the action-comedy "Red Notice" with over 236 million watches since its June release. The movie, which follows a fictional K-pop girl band using music and fighting skills to protect humans from demons, gained significant global momentum through positive word-of-mouth, viral videos, and memes on social media platforms. Its soundtrack has also achieved remarkable success, with multiple songs topping online streaming charts and the Billboard Hot 100, even outperforming real-life K-pop groups. Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, the film is widely praised for its eye-catching animation, its authentic depiction of Korean culture, and its exceptionally catchy K-pop songs, with discussions for a sequel already in early stages.</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a new "We the People DC" tourism campaign to actively counter negative perceptions, even as National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing duties like picking up trash. Approximately 110 Guard members are assigned to cleanup duty as part of a White House-directed "Safe and Beautiful Task Force," presenting unusual optics that highlight a persistent image problem for the capital. Despite a record 27.2 million visitors in 2024, international visitation is projected to drop in 2025, a troubling trend given overseas tourists' higher spending. The campaign aims to promote the city's vibrant local life and upcoming attractions for America's 250th anniversary in 2026, positioning the city's public relations efforts against a broader political battle over its future vision.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff overcame a challenging first-round match at the US Open, ultimately defeating Ajla Tomljanović 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in a grueling, nearly three-hour marathon on Arthur Ashe Stadium. Gauff struggled notably with her serve throughout the contest, committing ten double faults and being broken six times, even squandering an opportunity when serving for the match in the third set. However, the 21-year-old American demonstrated remarkable resilience, breaking back immediately before securing the hard-fought victory. Gauff acknowledged her serve remains a clear work in progress but viewed the demanding contest as a crucial early-round test, and she continues her campaign with the prospect of reaching the world No. 1 ranking still within reach.</p>

          <h2>China's Industrial Profits Show Slowest Decline in Five Months During July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 22:36:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits declined by 1.5% from a year earlier in July, marking the slowest pace of decrease in five months and indicating a notable recovery following months of steeper declines. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels, which have helped to improve profitability for companies. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell by 1.7% overall. State-backed industrial firms saw their bottom line drop more significantly by 7.5% in the January to July period, while businesses with foreign investments experienced a positive increase of 1.8%. The manufacturing and utilities sectors showed profit improvements, contrasting with a significant plunge in the mining industry, reflecting the mixed economic landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Less than eight months after devastating wildfires destroyed 16,000 buildings, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it is nearing completion of debris removal from nearly 10,000 residential properties in Los Angeles County, four months ahead of its January 2026 goal. Officials, including U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman and L.A. County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, lauded the federal response as the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history, clearing 2.5 million tons of fire debris. While some homeowners reported instances of sloppy work by federal contractors, the rapid progress has significantly paved the way for the rebuilding phase, with hundreds of permits already issued. This remarkable transformation from widespread devastation to active reconstruction provides a crucial foundation for healing and starting anew for affected communities.</p>

          <p>Authorities have successfully dismantled a sophisticated retail crime ring responsible for over 600 thefts at Home Depot locations across Southern California, collectively netting an estimated $10 million in stolen merchandise. Nine key individuals have been charged in a comprehensive 48-count criminal complaint following "Operation Kill Switch," which led to 14 arrests. The alleged leader, David Ahl, is accused of directing theft crews, known as "boosters," to seize high-value items which he then resold through his electronics storefront, a practice known as fencing. The operation, which involved family members, resulted in authorities seizing at least $3.7 million in stolen property and over $800,000 in suspected illicit money, aided by new legislation consolidating multi-county retail crimes.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, marking a significant achievement after a series of prior catastrophic failures this year. The Starship upper stage reached a suborbital trajectory, successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators, and performed a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean as planned, despite some damage to its heat shield and a control flap. The Super Heavy first stage also completed its planned return and splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico, demonstrating an alternate landing strategy. This success is crucial for SpaceX's ambitious goals to colonize Mars and for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on a modified Starship for future moon landings, boosting confidence in the vehicle's rapid development.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking collaborative team of U.S. and Chinese researchers has achieved a significant scientific breakthrough by developing a one-step method to efficiently convert diverse mixed plastic waste into valuable products like petrol, chemical raw materials, and hydrochloric acid. This innovative process, a first of its kind for difficult-to-degrade plastics, occurs remarkably at ambient temperature and pressure, reducing energy requirements. Published in the peer-reviewed journal "Science," this method strongly supports a circular economy by transforming otherwise polluting waste into useful products applicable across various essential industries, including water treatment, metal processing, pharmaceuticals, food production, and the petroleum sector, representing a major step forward in addressing plastic pollution and enhancing resource recovery.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their 53-man roster for the upcoming season, with Trey Lance notably winning the backup quarterback position behind starter Justin Herbert. The team waived 25 players, including veteran quarterback Taylor Heinicke and safety Tony Jefferson, and placed several others on injured reserve, reflecting ongoing strategic adjustments. The roster largely reflects coach Jim Harbaugh's vision for a run-oriented offense, featuring a new running back duo in Omarion Hampton and Najee Harris, who is recovering from an eye injury. While the offensive line faces injury challenges, the defensive line is considered the deepest group, and Khalil Mack is expected to remain a dominant force off the edge, aiming for a Super Bowl run.</p>
