          <p>The Chicago Sky secured a 92-85 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks, spoiling the jersey retirement ceremony for Sparks legend Candace Parker. Chicago's Angel Reese delivered a dominant performance with 24 points and 16 rebounds, a stat line only previously achieved by Parker and Lisa Leslie at the venue. Despite a third-quarter surge from the Sparks, fueled by Emma Cannon's season-high 15 points, Chicago's strong fourth-quarter play proved decisive. The halftime ceremony celebrated Parker's legacy as her No. 3 jersey was raised to the rafters.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a U.S. expert on Chinese law, suggests that current tensions in U.S.-China relations echo past disruptions, such as the period following 1989.

Mahboubi reflects on the immense changes in China over the past 30 years but sees a parallel in the current slow return of American students and scholars.

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the Club World Cup quarter-finals with a decisive 4-0 victory over Inter Miami. The European champions demonstrated their superiority from the outset, with two goals from Jo√£o Neves, one from Achraf Hakimi, and a Tom√°s Avil√©s own goal all coming before halftime. PSG controlled the match completely, leaving Inter Miami's star-studded lineup, including Lionel Messi and Luis Su√°rez, with little opportunity to impact the game. The result reflected the vast difference in resources and current competitive level between the two clubs.</p>
