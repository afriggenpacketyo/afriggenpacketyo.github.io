          <p>Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner has publicly supported late-night host Jimmy Kimmel following his indefinite suspension by ABC. In a social media post, Eisner criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for what he termed "out-of-control intimidation" of Disney and ABC, which preceded the network's decision to pull the show. Eisner questioned the state of corporate leadership in the face of such pressure and reaffirmed his view of Kimmel as a talented and funny performer. The suspension came after Kimmel made controversial comments regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling it "decidedly improper and impermissible." While tossing the lengthy 85-page complaint for being filled with "vituperation and invective," Judge Steven Merryday is allowing Trump's legal team to refile a more concise, 40-page version within 28 days. The judge criticized the original filing as a political document rather than a serious legal complaint. The lawsuit also targets four reporters and publisher Penguin Random House over a book about Trump's finances.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping "made progress" on a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok during a productive phone call. Following the conversation, Trump stated he has agreed to visit China early next year, and Xi will visit the U.S. at a later date. The call was intended to finalize a framework agreement that would resolve U.S. concerns over the social media platform's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Despite a law requiring ByteDance to divest, Trump has delayed its enforcement while negotiations for a potential deal continue.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a new funding round that values the company at $200 billion. This massive valuation reflects the intense investor interest in foundational AI models, following similar large-scale funding for competitors like Anthropic and OpenAI. Although Musk later denied the report, the funds would likely be used to acquire vast numbers of AI chips and build out the necessary computing infrastructure to compete in the AI arms race. The company's Grok chatbot has previously faced controversy for generating offensive and problematic content.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year note reaching its highest level in two weeks, in a counterintuitive move following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The yield climbed to 4.127% as investors balanced the Fed's monetary policy against signs of a resilient U.S. economy. While the Fed's cut was aimed at managing risks, strong economic indicators, like a recent dip in jobless claims, have tempered concerns about a slowdown. Investors in longer-term debt are weighing factors beyond short-term rates, including future growth, inflation, and government borrowing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The analysis notes that strong demand and controlled production capacity are creating favorable pricing dynamics for these firms.

The provision allows eligible workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually, but the guidance specifies which occupations qualify and which do not. Notably, workers in "specified service trades or businesses," such as healthcare and financial services, are excluded. The regulations also confirm that mandatory or automatic gratuities do not qualify for the deduction because they are not given voluntarily by the customer.

          <p>Following a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, borrowers now have more affordable options for financing. Among the cheapest ways to borrow money are home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which currently have average rates around 8.05% and are variable, meaning they could become cheaper with future cuts. Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, while personal loans provide an unsecured option that is still less expensive than high-interest credit cards. The downward trend in rates provides welcome relief for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, arguing that a central theme of his work was the hollowness and corrupting nature of victory. Despite his "golden-boy" image, Redford often portrayed characters whose athletic or personal deftness was a double-edged sword, leading to Pyrrhic victories. Films like *Downhill Racer*, *The Candidate*, and *Quiz Show* are highlighted as examples of his deep-seated distrust of the American obsession with winning at all costs. The article suggests Redford's legacy is that of a thoughtful artist who used his platform to explore complex truths.</p>
