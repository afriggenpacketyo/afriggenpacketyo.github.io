          <p>Republican-led tax legislation is poised to reignite international tax and trade wars, potentially straining relationships with key allies. The legislation aims to penalize foreign companies from countries enforcing the global minimum tax agreed upon in 2021, increasing their tax rates in the U.S. This move has raised concerns among finance ministers from the Group of 7 nations and could lead to retaliatory measures against American companies. The article explains that the Trump administration's actions could cripple international tax agreements and disrupt global investment.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett believes the stock market offers more opportunities than real estate for long-term investment. During Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett explained that while his long-time associate Charlie Munger enjoyed real estate deals later in life, stocks provide greater potential for growth, especially in the United States. The article supports Buffett's argument by comparing the historical performance of the S&P 500 to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, showing significantly higher returns in the stock market.</p>

          <p>The US has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar to join the Air Force One fleet, a gift that has sparked controversy, including criticism from some of President Trump's supporters. The plane, valued at an estimated $400 million, will require extensive modifications to meet security requirements for presidential transport. The White House insists the gift is legal and that the plane will be transferred to Trump's presidential library after his term, but concerns remain over the cost of retrofitting and potential influence from Qatar.</p>

          <p>The FDA has cleared the first blood test to detect amyloid plaques, a key marker of Alzheimer's disease, potentially revolutionizing diagnosis and treatment. The test, for individuals 55 and older with cognitive symptoms, offers a quicker and more accurate assessment compared to current methods like PET scans and spinal taps. Experts believe the blood test will improve diagnostic accuracy, enable earlier diagnoses, and increase access to testing, especially in underserved communities. This could lead to more patients receiving timely treatment with amyloid-reducing drugs.</p>

Over 10 million pensioners lost eligibility for the payments when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. The ministers will change the threshold to allow more pensioners to qualify again. The income threshold for pension credit is currently ¬£11,800 a year for individuals and ¬£18,023 for pensioner couples. The prime minister's spokesman declined to guarantee it would be in place this coming winter.</p>
