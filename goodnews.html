          <p>A woman whose body was discovered in Spain over 20 years ago has been identified as 31-year-old Russian citizen Liudmila Zavada. The breakthrough came through 'Operation Identify Me,' an Interpol-led campaign that publicly shares information on unidentified female murder victims in Europe. Ms. Zavada's body was found in July 2005 near Barcelona, and her death was considered suspicious, but her identity remained a mystery. Turkish police matched her fingerprints to a national database earlier this year, leading to a DNA confirmation with a relative in Russia. She is the third person identified by the initiative, which aims to solve dozens of similar cold cases across the continent.</p>

          <p>Three weeks after his £18.1 million transfer to Manchester United, 23-year-old goalkeeper Senne Lammens has yet to make his debut for the club. Despite impressing in training with his calm presence and strong fundamentals, head coach Ruben Amorim has opted to start the incumbent Altay Bayindir, citing Lammens' need to adapt to a new league and country. However, Bayindir's recent performances and statistics have been subpar, leading many to believe it is only a matter of time before Lammens is given his chance. The club's early exit from the EFL Cup has removed a potential 'soft landing' for his first appearance, meaning his debut will likely come under the high pressure of a Premier League match.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch, once a struggling talent at Bayern Munich, has transformed into one of Europe's top midfielders under the guidance of manager Arne Slot. After a quiet first season, Slot repurposed Gravenberch as a holding midfielder, a role in which he excelled, before granting him more attacking freedom this season to great effect. The Dutch player has been a standout performer, scoring two goals in four league games after scoring none last season, and demonstrating superior defensive and creative statistics. This resurgence has vindicated the faith shown by Slot and has positioned Gravenberch as a key player for both Liverpool and the Netherlands national team.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche has announced its ambition to become a top-three global player in the lucrative obesity drug market, directly challenging leaders Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The company is advancing its experimental weight-loss injection, CT-388, into a phase III trial, the final stage before seeking regulatory approval. This move is part of a broader strategy that includes other drug candidates like Petrelintide, acquired through major partnerships and biotech purchases. Roche's CEO expressed confidence that its diverse pipeline of treatments will enable the company to successfully enter the highly competitive market, with a target launch for its suite of obesity drugs by 2030.</p>

          <p>State-affiliated buyers in China, known as the "national team," held a combined $553.1 billion in domestic stocks as of June, a figure that now exceeds the total holdings of foreign investors. This strategic buying accounts for 4.8% of the market's publicly tradable shares and is seen as a key factor in a major stock benchmark reaching a decade high last month. The intervention reflects a government effort to ensure financial stability and promote the stock market as a means for household wealth preservation amid a property market downturn. Analysts suggest this state support is likely to continue, potentially driving stocks higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has vowed to speed up the global rollout of its homegrown BeiDou navigation system, a rival to the U.S.-owned Global Positioning System (GPS). At a recent summit, Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang stated that the system has entered a new phase of global development after 31 years of work, with improved performance and widespread application. The BeiDou system, which achieved global coverage in 2020, already dominates the Chinese domestic market, powering over 70% of consumer devices like smartphones and wearables. The push for international expansion aims to enlarge its "circle of international friends" and establish it as critical infrastructure for users worldwide.</p>

After the Dodgers' bullpen squandered a 4-1 lead in the eighth inning, Kershaw pitched a perfect ninth to send the game to extras. Tommy Edman's RBI single in the 11th inning provided the winning run, capping a resilient team effort that showcased the kind of improvisation the team may need for a successful postseason run.</p>

Mainland China's CSI 300 also advanced, while markets in South Korea and Australia posted modest gains.

The ruling is a victory for 20 states that sued the administration, arguing that their critical disaster response funding was being held hostage to enforce the president's immigration agenda. U.S. District Judge William Smith found the policy to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," stating that the potential loss of these funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety.

This surge is driven by falling technology costs and the development of large-scale energy plants by Chinese firms, particularly in countries like South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria.
