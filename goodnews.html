          <p>The chancellor has announced a partial U-turn on winter fuel payments, ensuring more people will receive the allowance this winter. The payment, which helps cover energy costs during the coldest months, was previously limited to those on pension credit, a policy criticized for disproportionately affecting lower-income pensioners. While details are pending the autumn Budget, the means test will be increased to broaden eligibility, however, the pensions minister clarified that the payment will not return to being universally distributed to all pensioners, as the government aims to avoid paying millionaires. This adjustment seeks to balance fiscal responsibility with support for vulnerable pensioners.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands' Rijksmuseum is showcasing a nearly 200-year-old condom decorated with erotic art as part of an exhibition called "Safe Sex?" about 19th-century sex work. Believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, the condom features an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen, with the phrase "This is my choice" written along the sheath in French. The museum acquired the condom at an auction and highlights both the playful and serious sides of sexual health in an era fraught with fears of unwanted pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History stumbled upon a new understanding of the Oort Cloud while preparing a planetarium show called "Encounters in the Milky Way." During a test run of a scene depicting the Oort Cloud, they noticed a spiral shape within the inner section, resembling a bar with two waving arms, similar to the Milky Way galaxy. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell. The researchers published their findings in The Astrophysical Journal, noting the difficulty of confirming the shape through observations but suggesting that further study of distant comet orbits could provide clues.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country, marking a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules that have historically favored London and the south-east. The funding will support tram, train, and bus projects in mayoral authorities, including Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Liverpool City Region, the North East, West of England, Tees Valley, and the East Midlands. While some Conservative figures acknowledged the importance of the funding, shadow chancellor Mel Stride criticized Labour's promises, and Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper urged the chancellor to deliver on the promises. The transport investment marks Reeves' first open move away from the stringent rules in the Treasury's Green Book.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, leading to increased benefits and retroactive payments for nearly 3 million individuals. The Fairness Act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for those receiving income from public pensions not subject to Social Security payroll taxes. The agency credits automation for expediting payments and aims to update all beneficiary records by early November. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has committed to completing the updates swiftly, emphasizing the agency's commitment to fulfilling its obligations.</p>

          <p>The UK secured an exemption from the doubling of US tariffs on imported steel, providing relief to UK trade officials following President Trump's executive order. Despite a previous agreement on May 8 to reduce tariffs on metals to zero, the UK government was uncertain about receiving special treatment until the announcement. However, the exemption is contingent on finalizing the deal by July 9, creating uncertainty for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The UK also agreed to cut tariffs on some US beef products and ethanol, which has raised concerns about potential impacts on domestic steelmakers and the UK ethanol market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that emotions persist due to a sustained signal in the brain following an experience, creating a broader state that influences subsequent events. Researchers recreated emotional responses in a lab using air puffs to the cornea, observing two distinct phases of brain activity: an initial sensory input spike and a later, sustained activity in emotion-related circuits. The study, published in the journal Science, found that this sustained response strengthens with repeated stimuli and can be blocked by ketamine, an anesthetic. While some experts question whether this lingering signal is specific to emotion, the research highlights the role of persistent brain signals in altering brain states.</p>

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is scheduled to vote on proposed regulations aimed at limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to smog. The rules would set zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, beginning in 2027 and increasing to 90% by 2036. While supporters say the plan is crucial for improving air quality and public health, opponents argue it will strain the electric grid and increase costs for consumers.</p>
