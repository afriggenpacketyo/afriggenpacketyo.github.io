This victory comes after a dramatic collapse in the 2018 Giro and several subsequent attempts, with Yates now set to support Jonas Vingegaard in the Tour de France.

          <p>AB Hernandez, a teenage transgender athlete in California, won two track events over the weekend, tying for first place in both the high jump and triple jump. This occurred amidst ongoing political attacks from right-wing figures and the Trump administration, which threatened to withhold federal funding from California for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports. The California Interscholastic Federation recently changed its rules so that if a transgender athlete places in a girls' event, the athlete finishing behind will also receive the same medal and placement. Hernandez's participation and success have sparked national attention and debate, with the Justice Department investigating potential violations of federal sex-discrimination law.</p>
