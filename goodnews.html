        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia has announced a monumental plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, aimed at facilitating a massive expansion of artificial intelligence infrastructure. This strategic partnership will support OpenAI's goal to construct and deploy data centers requiring 10 gigawatts of power, built around Nvidia's advanced AI processors. The investment will be deployed progressively as infrastructure milestones are met, with the first phase utilizing Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin systems. This collaboration underscores the deepening ties between the two companies at the forefront of the AI boom and signals the immense computational power required for future AI development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against the Revolution Wind farm, allowing construction to resume. The Danish renewable energy company Orsted announced it will restart work as soon as possible on the nearly completed project off the coast of New England. The judge ruled that Orsted demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. This decision marks a significant setback for the administration's efforts to halt the development of the offshore wind industry in the United States.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia's commitment to invest $100 billion in OpenAI is being interpreted by market analysts as a clear indicator that the artificial intelligence boom is still in its nascent stages. The scale of the investment, intended for a massive 10-gigawatt AI data center buildout, suggests an unprecedented demand for computational power that far exceeds current forecasts. This partnership is expected to fuel further growth not only for Nvidia but for the entire AI ecosystem, including energy and cloud providers. The deal is seen as additive to Nvidia's existing projections, signaling a new phase of accelerated expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments for a $100,000 home equity loan have become slightly more affordable. For a 15-year loan, the average monthly cost is now around $974, a modest decrease from earlier in the year, reflecting the minor drop in associated interest rates. While the savings are not substantial, they contribute to a trend of slowly decreasing costs for homeowners looking to borrow against their record-high equity levels. The article provides a breakdown of current costs compared to previous periods and discusses the alternative of a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance more than doubled after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his successful call on Opendoor, recommended the stock. Jackson dubbed the company "the Shopify of mortgages" and suggested it could be a "potential 350-bagger in 2 years," causing the stock to soar to an intraday high of $94.06. He argued that the company is undervalued compared to newly public competitors like Figure Technology Solutions, despite growing faster. Jackson's firm, EMJ Capital, has taken a position in the company, fueling intense investor interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has overtaken Modelo Especial to become the best-selling beer in the United States, according to recent retail data. This marks a significant shift in the market, as Modelo had previously unseated Bud Light from the top spot following a consumer backlash two years ago. The change in leadership reflects a reversal of fortunes for parent company AB InBev, while Modelo's brewer, Constellation Brands, has faced challenges including tariffs and weaker demand from its core Hispanic consumer base. Michelob Ultra's success signals a comeback for the brewing giant in the competitive U.S. market.</p>

          <p>In his first major address, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a case for aggressive interest rate cuts, arguing that current policy is overly restrictive. Miran, who dissented in the Fed's recent quarter-point cut by advocating for a half-point reduction, believes rates should be nearly two percentage points lower. He cited factors like changing immigration policies, easing rental costs, and tariff revenues as creating a new economic landscape that warrants a more accommodative stance.

Experts generally recommend investing through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as a more efficient and liquid option than buying physical coins or bars. Gold is considered a safe-haven asset that performs well during periods of economic uncertainty and low interest rates.
