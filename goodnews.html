        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global equities experienced modest gains following President Trump's announcement of a potential ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Investor sentiment appears subdued, possibly indicating a growing desensitization to Trump's policy changes. The muted market response is also attributed to Iran's relatively restrained reaction to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, specifically the missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar that resulted in no casualties. This suggests a market that is becoming less reactive to geopolitical events and more focused on underlying economic fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, compounded by U.S. military strikes, is forcing airlines to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western airlines face greater disruption compared to their Chinese counterparts because they remain barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to utilize it. The airspace closures in Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Jordan due to the conflict have led to flight diversions and cancellations. Western firms are rerouting flights through Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, while Chinese airlines have more flexibility due to access to Russian airspace.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is considering mandating changes to Google's search services to foster greater competition. This investigation stems from a new law empowering the CMA to demand alterations if a company wields excessive power in a specific market. Google dominates the UK search market, accounting for over 90% of searches, and 200,000 businesses rely on its search advertising. While Google has pledged to cooperate with the CMA, the company acknowledges that the announcement poses significant challenges to its UK operations. The outcome of this investigation could reshape the digital landscape and influence how businesses and consumers interact with online search engines.</p>

The island, featuring a ruined castle, a working farm, and holiday accommodations, is on the market for ¬£5.5 million. Jim Gully, whose family has lived on the island for generations, described an idyllic childhood spent on its beaches and coves. The castle on the island was commissioned by a New Zealand-born adventurer in 1911, but fell into disrepair in the 1980s due to high upkeep costs.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% following a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar that resulted in no reported casualties. The decline suggests investors believe the conflict between Iran and the U.S. will de-escalate. Prices had previously surged after the U.S. joined Israel's campaign against Iran, but the limited impact of Iran's response led to a market sell-off. Analysts suggest that President Trump's strategy of escalating to de-escalate may be working, as the lack of casualties eased fears of further conflict.</p>
