          <p>President Donald Trump concluded his four-day visit to Scotland, engaging in discussions with First Minister John Swinney primarily focused on securing an exemption for Scotch whisky from a 10% US tariff. This tariff significantly impacts the Scottish economy, with whisky exports to the US valued at nearly £1 billion. Beyond trade, the President also opened a new course at his Aberdeenshire golf resort and reiterated his strong opposition to wind turbines, advocating for increased exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. The article captures the dual nature of his trip, combining political diplomacy with personal business interests.</p>

          <p>As the trendy Labubu collectible toy gains popularity, this article highlights its "ancestor," the Monchhichi, and its East German counterpart, the Tiemi. While Monchhichi dolls were a global sensation in the 1980s, their import was banned in communist East Germany. The Tiemi, named after designer Susanne Tieme, was produced in Sonneberg, a historic toy-making town, and became popular across the Eastern Bloc. This piece explores how the Tiemi circumvented authenticity issues by being a distinct, state-produced version, becoming a unique collectible item after German reunification.</p>

          <h2>Barclays Exceeds Second-Quarter Profit Forecasts Driven by Strong Investment Banking Performance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British bank Barclays reported pre-tax profits of £2.5 billion in the second quarter, surpassing analyst estimates, largely due to a surge in investment banking revenues. The unit's income rose 10% year-on-year, benefiting from market volatility following US President Donald Trump's tariff policies. This article notes that Barclays, like other major banks, capitalized on turbulent markets. CEO C.S. Venkatakrishnan stated the bank is on track to achieve its three-year plan objectives, delivering higher and more stable returns despite ongoing challenges like potential US capital rule changes.
