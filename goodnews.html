          <p>A California appeals court upheld a $1 million jury verdict against the El Segundo Unified School District for failing to protect a former middle school student from bullying. Eleri Irons sued the district in 2019, alleging she was subjected to verbal and cyberbullying by fellow students. The court found the district negligent in supervising and training its employees, contributing to the harm suffered by Irons. The district's arguments for immunity and lack of mandatory duty to protect students were rejected by the appeals court.</p>
