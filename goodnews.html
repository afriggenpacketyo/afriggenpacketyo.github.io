        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump publicly weighed in on Cracker Barrel's controversial rebranding, urging the company to revert to its old logo and "admit a mistake based on customer response." In a Truth Social post, Trump suggested the company had received "a Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" and should leverage it to become a "WINNER again." The White House's official X account amplified this sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet featuring a Trump-themed Cracker Barrel logo. This commentary follows similar criticism from Donald Trump Jr. and a drop in the company's stock after the new minimalist logo was unveiled, highlighting the politicalization of corporate branding.</p>

          <p>Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has expressed doubts about England's "killer instinct" needed to secure victory in the upcoming Ashes 2025 series in Australia. Langer, a four-time Ashes winner as a player and two-time unbeaten coach, noted England's recent 2-2 series draws against India and Australia as evidence of their struggle to decisively close out contests. He asserted that England must employ an aggressive "Bazball" strategy down under to effectively counter Australia's formidable bowling attack, including Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins. This pre-series commentary contributes to the growing psychological battle, intensifying anticipation for the highly awaited cricket tournament.</p>

          <p>Schools in flood-devastated regions of Texas have successfully reopened for students, transitioning from their critical role as "relief hubs" for volunteers responding to the deadly Fourth of July flash floods. Institutions like Hunt school provided vital shelter, food, and operational bases for recovery efforts, exemplifying profound community resilience. With 135 lives lost and over 100 people still missing, a significant challenge for educators now involves balancing academic progress with addressing the profound social and emotional needs of children grappling with tragedy. School leaders are prioritizing compassion and support, aiming to create safe and nurturing environments for healing and learning, acknowledging that "it's OK to not be OK."</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 75% after AT&T announced an agreement to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash deal. This transaction will add about 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network across over 400 US markets, with the deal expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval. EchoStar stated the sale is part of its efforts to address FCC inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, following complaints from Elon Musk's SpaceX about underused spectrum. The companies also expanded their network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Credit Card Debt: Comparing Balance Transfers, Personal Loans, and HELOCs</h2>

          <p>With average credit card interest rates high and balances growing, many seek ways to manage and reduce debt. This article compares three primary tools: balance transfer credit cards, personal loans, and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). Balance transfers offer temporary 0% interest but incur fees and have an expiry. Personal loans provide fixed payments and an end date but often have higher rates. HELOCs offer low rates by leveraging home equity but carry the risk of foreclosure. Choosing the best option depends on credit score, income, home equity, and payoff timeline, requiring careful consideration of mechanics, costs, and potential drawbacks (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Experts Forecast Modest Mortgage Interest Rate Drops for Fall 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:37:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently around 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are expected to see modest drops by late fall 2025, according to experts. While the Federal Reserve may cut the federal funds rate in September, mortgage rates, which follow the bond market, might not immediately mirror this. Analysts project rates could trend towards 6% by year-end, a "psychological barrier" that could significantly increase homebuyer demand. This potential influx of buyers could, however, push home prices up, creating a "double-edged sword" for prospective homeowners. Borrowers are advised to shop around and maintain good credit to navigate the evolving market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Plus-size model Ashley Alexiss, known for her "Beauty is not a size" motto, expressed sadness that some no longer consider her a role model after her unintentional 100-pound weight loss. The transformation began after she quit drinking and experienced profound grief following her father's death. Alexiss highlights the challenge of accepting her new body after years of advocating for body acceptance in her previous size, noting she now receives attention and respect she believes she should have received heavier. She is using non-invasive CellSound treatments for skin tightening and emphasizes self-care and self-love, stating her identity remains unchanged regardless of size.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts advise that setting your home's air conditioning thermostat a few degrees higher than normal when you are away is generally the most effective strategy for balancing energy efficiency, comfort, and humidity. While completely turning off the AC for several hours can save money, it poses a risk of mold in humid environments and can increase wear and tear on the system when it has to work harder to rapidly recool. The optimal approach varies based on climate, home insulation, and the type of AC unit. Simple, "time-honored strategies" like blocking sunlight and opening windows at night can also significantly contribute to keeping homes cool and managing rising electricity costs.</p>

This needle-free alternative aims to boost supply and accessibility in the lucrative GLP-1 market, potentially launching next year.

          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a significant shift, with rent growth slowing and luxury amenities losing their appeal amidst broader economic concerns. Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing operator, notes a "fall-off at the top and the bottom," with students opting for cheaper, older rentals over new, amenity-rich buildings. Preferences are moving towards functional spaces like co-working rooms over recreational features. This trend, coupled with a drop in new development due to higher construction costs, is driving investment towards large, flagship public universities experiencing record enrollment growth, creating opportunities for operators focused on affordability and practical value.</p>

          <p>UK budget retailer Poundland has narrowly avoided administration after the High Court approved its turnaround plan, just days before it was set to run out of cash. The rescue deal involves a significant £90 million injection from its private equity owner, Gordon Brothers, alongside a three-year deferral of £276.5 million in loans and rent reductions for unprofitable stores. This restructuring, which includes closing 68 stores and a distribution site, aims to stabilize the business and return it to growth by revamping ranges and lowering prices. The decision secures the future of approximately 14,700 staff, though some job losses are anticipated from store closures.</p>

          <p>As many francophone African nations celebrate 65 years of independence, President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast calls for reflection on their journey. While some nations, particularly in the Sahel, still rank low on the Human Development Index due to factors like infertile land, limited resources, high birthrates, and political instability, overall progress is evident. Over the past 65 years, extreme poverty has declined, life expectancy has risen, and infant mortality has fallen across most of these countries. Despite waning French political influence, close economic ties, including the CFA franc currency system, endure, and remittances from the diaspora significantly contribute to development.</p>
