          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit, surpassing market estimates and setting a new company record. This growth is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strength of the AI market, TSMC's CEO raised the company's 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The company is also monitoring potential impacts from U.S. tariff policies but expects its significant investments in U.S. facilities to mitigate some risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Melissa Tran, a mother of five from Maryland, has been released from ICE custody after being detained for over five months due to a non-violent theft conviction from two decades ago. Tran, who came to the U.S. legally as a refugee from Vietnam, was unexpectedly detained during a routine annual check-in with immigration authorities. A federal judge ordered her release, finding her continued detention unnecessary, but she still faces the possibility of deportation. Her case highlights the complexities of the U.S. immigration system, as her lawyers argue her past offense has been reclassified and she has since built a stable life.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and issued an optimistic profit forecast for the final quarter of the year. The carrier anticipates earning between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, above the consensus estimate of $2.86. While adjusted earnings were strong, total revenue of $15.23 billion fell slightly short of projections, and unit revenue declined amid increased flight capacity. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the company's resilience to long-term investments in customer experience and network expansion, which have helped attract loyal, high-paying travelers.

          <p>The Guide Dogs charity in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has welcomed a litter of 13 puppies, its largest in three years. Affectionately named "the baker's dozen," the puppies have all been given bakery-themed names such as Biscuit, Crumpet, and Ginger. The charity, which runs the world's largest breeding program for assistance dogs, was surprised by the large number of arrivals. These puppies will soon be placed with volunteer puppy raisers across the UK, beginning their journey to become life-changing guide dogs for visually impaired individuals by 2027.</p>

          <p>London's Royal Albert Hall is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament, marking only the second time in the sport's 1,500-year history that its most prestigious competition has been held outside of Japan. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days. To ensure authenticity, organizers shipped 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the traditional ring, or dohyo. The tournament underscores the deep cultural and religious significance of sumo, which is interwoven with Shinto rituals, and offers a rare opportunity for a Western audience to experience the ancient sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instagram has announced a new default content setting for teen accounts that aims to filter their experience to be similar to a "PG-13 movie." This move is part of a broader effort by social media platforms to address concerns about protecting young users from inappropriate content, as lawmakers push for stricter regulations like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). While creating a safer, age-appropriate internet is a widely shared goal, the article notes the significant technical and privacy challenges of effective age verification online. Critics argue that such measures are a step toward making platforms safer, but the path to a truly regulated online environment remains complex.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's legislature has passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia, making it the first country in South America to do so via legislation. The law permits a healthcare professional to end the life of a mentally competent patient suffering from an incurable illness that causes unbearable suffering, even if the condition is not terminal. The move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the most socially liberal nations in the region, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. The legislation was passed despite opposition from the Catholic Church in the highly secular country.</p>

          <h2>British Library Reissues Oscar Wilde's Library Card 130 Years After It Was Revoked</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 06:30:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to the celebrated Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after his original was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." Wilde was excluded from the library's reading room due to his criminal charge for homosexual relationships. The new card, which will be collected by his grandson, is intended as a symbolic gesture to acknowledge the injustice and suffering Wilde endured. His grandson, Merlin Holland, called the act a "lovely gesture of forgiveness," which fittingly took place on what would have been Wilde's 171st birthday.</p>
