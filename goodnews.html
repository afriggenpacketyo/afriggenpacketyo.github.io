          <p>Alibaba Group Holding plans to significantly increase its capital expenditures on artificial intelligence infrastructure, surpassing its initial 380 billion yuan ($53 billion) commitment over the next three years. CEO Eddie Wu Yongming, also chairman of Alibaba Cloud, announced this at the Apsara Conference, aiming for Alibaba Cloud to become a global leader in full-stack AI services. Wu believes Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will usher in a new era, potentially automating 80% of existing jobs and empowering "super scientists" to tackle global challenges like healthcare and climate change. This move reflects a broader trend of increased AI investment by tech giants, including Nvidia's $100 billion pledge to OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, successfully filling the congressional seat left vacant by her late father, Raul Grijalva. This victory significantly narrows the Republican Party's razor-thin majority in the US House of Representatives. Grijalva, who garnered support from progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, campaigned against President Trump's policies and advocated for the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. Her win in this heavily Democratic district, which she secured over Republican Daniel Butierez, shifts the House balance to 219 Republicans and 214 Democrats, with two seats still open.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump voiced his surprise and disapproval on Truth Social regarding ABC's decision to reinstate late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel's show had been suspended after comments he made about the death of Charlie Kirk.

He also hinted at potential action against ABC, referencing a past settlement.

          <p>USC's football team faces uncertainty regarding the availability of star wideout Ja’Kobi Lane and starting left tackle Elijah Paige as they enter a crucial conference schedule. Lane, recovering from an upper body injury, returned to practice but his game status remains unclear, while Paige was absent from practice after leaving a previous game early. Coach Lincoln Riley declined to provide updates, referring to the Big Ten's official availability report. The team's offensive line has already seen shifts due to Paige's absence, and Illinois, USC's next opponent, is also dealing with significant defensive injuries.</p>

          <p>A recent decennial parade in Beijing held significant meaning for Hong Kong and Macau, transcending mere spectacle to project national destiny and institutional resilience. The article argues that such displays, often viewed through a Western-centric lens as mere "muscle flexing," are instead declarations of deep national cohesion for the Chinese people. It suggests the orderly and formidable ranks of the parade offer an emotional release and resonance with the nation's trajectory, allowing individuals to connect with a collective identity amidst a fragmented global order. This event reinforces China's established global influence and internal unity.</p>

          <p>Chicago Cubs third baseman Matt Shaw defended his decision to miss a crucial playoff-implication game to attend a memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona. Shaw, who bonded with Kirk over their shared Christian faith, stated he had no regrets despite the Cubs losing 1-0 in his absence. This decision, made after consulting teammates and management, was met with understanding from some, like veteran outfielder Ian Happ, who acknowledged the "human element" of losing a friend. However, it also drew criticism from others, including Mets announcer Gary Cohen, who found it unusual to prioritize a non-family memorial during a playoff race.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly shifted his position on the war in Ukraine, now stating that Kyiv can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form" with European and NATO support. This declaration, made on Truth Social after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Ukraine might need to cede territory. Trump cited Russia's "BIG Economic trouble" as a key factor, calling Russia a "paper tiger." Zelenskyy hailed this as a "big shift" and a "positive signal," indicating an improved understanding between the two leaders regarding Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>The US Secret Service has successfully dismantled a vast telecommunications network in the New York Tri-State Area, which posed a significant threat to NYC's telecom systems and the ongoing UN General Assembly meetings. Investigators discovered 300 SIM servers containing over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending 30 million texts per minute and potentially disabling cell phone towers or blocking emergency communications. The sophisticated and well-funded network, linked to foreign governments, organized crime, and human trafficking, was uncovered following telephonic threats to senior US officials. While the immediate threat is neutralized, the investigation is ongoing, with potential arrests to follow.</p>

          <p>China's successive five-year plans, implemented since 1953, have been foundational in shaping the country's economic trajectory, despite its shift away from a command economy.

The article provides a historical survey, highlighting milestones like the first plan's emphasis on heavy industry, and sets the stage for the upcoming 15th five-year plan.

          <p>The US Air Force is planning to replace its C-17A Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo planes with a single Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) platform, targeting a mid-2040s deployment. This "two-for-one" replacement aims for greater speed, operational flexibility, and enhanced defensive capabilities against evolving threats on the ground and in the air. Air Mobility Command head Gen. John Lamontagne emphasized the need for agility and survivability, acknowledging the challenges of combining the distinct capabilities of the C-17 and C-5 into one aircraft. The initiative seeks to proactively recapitalize aging fleets before they become unserviceable.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media announced it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, even as the late-night show returns to ABC after a week-long suspension. This decision mirrors Sinclair's earlier announcement, meaning dozens of ABC affiliates will not broadcast Kimmel's show. Both companies cited the need for "respectful, constructive dialogue" following Kimmel's comments on Charlie Kirk's death, which initially led to the show's indefinite hiatus. Nexstar highlighted that the show remains available on Disney-owned streaming platforms, while its stations will focus on local programming.

          <p>International health experts and organizations are strongly rejecting President Trump's announcement linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism. The European Medicines Agency, UK's MHRA, and Australian health authorities have all issued statements affirming the safety of paracetamol during pregnancy, citing robust scientific evidence that contradicts these claims. Spain's Minister of Health explicitly criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, referencing his past controversial health suggestions. This global consensus underscores the lack of scientific basis for Trump's assertions, reinforcing the importance of established medical guidance over unsubstantiated claims.</p>

Now nearly 12 years sober, she sought help in 2013 after confiding in her family, leading to a six-week rehab stay and commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous. Lulu described herself as a "highly functioning alcoholic," even participating in "Strictly Come Dancing" while secretly drinking. She attributes her secretiveness to shame and a desire to maintain a "squeaky clean" image, and her childhood experiences with an alcoholic, abusive father.
