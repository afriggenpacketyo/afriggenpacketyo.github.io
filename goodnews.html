        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, primarily boosted by warm, sunny weather and the Women's Euro football tournament. Sectors like clothing, footwear, and online retail reported strong growth, contributing to this positive monthly performance. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also acknowledged and revised errors in its past data, which had led to concerns about statistical quality and delays in reporting. Despite the strong July figures, overall sales for the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous quarter, with economists cautioning that these specific, temporary factors are unlikely to be repeated, suggesting a more tempered outlook for the broader economy amidst rising retailer costs.</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher on Friday, extending gains as investors awaited a crucial U.S. jobs report expected to influence Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. The regional Stoxx 600 index increased by 0.25%, with mining stocks leading the rally. Market sentiment improved following Thursday's U.S. payrolls data, which strengthened bets on a September Fed rate cut without signaling a severe economic downturn. All attention is now on the August jobs report, which economists forecast to show an addition of 75,000 jobs, hoping for a 'Goldilocks' reading to reinforce rate cut expectations. Shares of Danish wind farm developer Orsted fell 2% after cutting its full-year earnings guidance, citing lower wind speeds and ongoing political obstructions to its U.S. projects.

          <p>A growing number of millennials and Gen Zers are becoming entrepreneurs by acquiring existing small businesses through an investment vehicle called 'search funds.' This trend addresses a looming succession crisis as many baby boomer business owners prepare for retirement without a clear plan. Search funds allow individuals to raise capital from investors to buy and operate established companies, aiming for growth and a profitable exit. This model offers lower risk than starting from scratch, leveraging existing customers and revenue, and has shown impressive returns, with an internal rate of return of 35.1% over 40 years. These funds also provide aspiring CEOs with crucial mentorship and resources, offering a supported path to business ownership in a turbulent economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italy is experiencing a surge in ultra-wealthy arrivals, drawn by its investor-friendly environment, thriving real estate market, and an accommodative flat-tax regime introduced in 2017.

This influx has made Italy a top relocation destination for millionaires in Europe this year, with an estimated 3,600 new high-net-worth individuals. The increased wealth has spurred a boom in Milan's property prices, which have risen 49% since the tax regime's inception, and fostered new businesses catering to this affluent demographic.
