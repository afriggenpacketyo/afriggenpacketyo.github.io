          <p>The end of the 'de minimis' rule, which allowed low-value packages from China to enter the US without tariffs, has led to panic-buying and price hikes for online shoppers. President Trump's decision to end the carve-out, coupled with new trade tariffs, has caused e-commerce brands to warn of potential failures for smaller firms. Shoppers are bracing for higher costs and potential shortages, with some canceling orders due to significant price increases. The article explores the economic impact of the policy change, particularly on lower-income households, and the potential benefits for larger American retailers.</p>

          <p>Faced with crippling tariffs from the US, Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their manufacturing operations to Vietnam. This move aims to circumvent tariffs and maintain access to the American market, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the relocation process. However, Vietnam faces challenges in accommodating the influx of factories and is working with US officials to prevent China from using the country as a tariff loophole. Despite increased costs and logistical hurdles, many Chinese companies see Vietnam as a viable short-term and long-term solution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping job cuts at numerous federal agencies, citing concerns about the legality of the administration's reorganization efforts. The judge ruled that the federal employee unions are likely to prove that the administration exceeded its legal authority in attempting to downsize the government. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or putting workers on administrative leave, pending further consideration of the case.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has been reportedly subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, though Swift's representative denies her direct involvement in the film's creative decisions. The lawsuit stems from Lively's allegations of on-set sexual harassment and Baldoni's countersuit claiming defamation. Baldoni's team suggests Lively and a 'megacelebrity friend' pressured him to accept script changes. Swift's representative stated that her only connection to the film was licensing her song 'My Tears Ricochet' for the trailer and a scene.</p>
