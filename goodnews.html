          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence algorithms, narrowing the gap with the United States despite lagging significantly in chip technology. Shum, the former head of AI at Microsoft, noted that the U.S. maintains a clear and substantial lead in AI chip production, a challenge that will take years for China to overcome. However, he highlighted Chinese firm DeepSeek as an example of algorithmic progress, achieving top-tier results with far fewer resources than its American counterparts. This suggests China's strategic focus on algorithm engineering could be a key factor in the ongoing tech competition.</p>

          <p>Investor Warren Buffett has announced a new donation of $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable foundations, continuing his long-standing philanthropic pledge. This latest contribution brings his total giving since 2006 to approximately $60 billion. The largest portion of the new donation is designated for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. Buffett, who plans to step down as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO, has committed to giving away about 99.5% of his estate to philanthropy, emphasizing that his wealth was a product of sound decisions and the "American tailwind."</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor cuts after being bitten in waist-deep water at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. While the woman did not see what bit her, officials believe the injuries are consistent with those from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended as a precaution, but resumed the next day after drone and lifeguard checks of the water found no further threats. The woman was treated for non-life-threatening injuries and is expected to recover fully.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has again rejected an attempt by former President Donald Trump to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated "Central Park Five" dismissed. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The five men, who were wrongfully convicted as teenagers, are suing Trump for defamatory statements he made during a 2024 presidential debate. They allege he falsely claimed they had killed someone and pleaded guilty, statements which are demonstrably false.</p>

          <p>On the tenth anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage, a pioneering Maryland couple, Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, are reflecting on their journey. They were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit that, while unsuccessful in court, helped build momentum for marriage equality in the state, which was achieved in 2012. The couple shared their experiences of facing obstacles in healthcare and daily life, emphasizing their fight was for their children and for basic rights. They also expressed concern over recent legal challenges and rhetoric that threaten to roll back these hard-won protections for LGBTQ+ people.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a specialized printer that adds braille to beer can labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), the state's largest employer of blind and low-vision workers. The student-invented machine can handle materials that commercial braille printers cannot and is designed with open hardware, making it accessible for operators with low vision. The printer has already produced 400 labels for a special "Blind Spot" beer, created for a fundraiser supporting individuals with vision loss.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new record highs, navigating a week that began with significant geopolitical risk following U.S. strikes in Iran. The market quickly stabilized as fears of a wider conflict subsided, leading to a sharp drop in oil prices, which eased inflation concerns. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by growing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year, despite a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation report. This optimism allowed major indices to post strong weekly gains, with the Nasdaq having its best quarter since 2020. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that upon marriage, men likely moved into their wife's household, and female offspring remained connected to their maternal homes. The findings challenge traditional assumptions about ancient social structures and suggest that maternal lineage played a key role in the community's identity and organization.</p>

The strong result comes after McLaren introduced car upgrades aimed at improving front-end feel, which Norris credited for his renewed confidence.
