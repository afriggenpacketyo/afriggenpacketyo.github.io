        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill, at the request of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, although experts argue that concerns are largely unfounded and fueled by biased reports. Mifepristone was initially approved by the FDA in 2000 after a comprehensive review determined its safety and effectiveness, and periodic reviews since then have not revealed new safety concerns. The review comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the pill's availability in 2024, preserving access to the drug.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a review of its rice policy in response to soaring grain prices, aiming to increase production and prevent supply shortages. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to ensure stable rice supplies, as prices have doubled over the past year, leading to the release of government stockpiles to curb the surge. The government is examining why the price uptrend has persisted and exploring potential responses, given that small fluctuations in rice harvests can lead to significant price swings. The meeting also addressed concerns about the declining number of rice farmers and the need for a safety net to support farmers vulnerable to price fluctuations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has trimmed interest rates by 25 basis points, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the 2% ECB target rate in May, hitting 1.9%, prompting the central bank to take action. The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, compared to a previous forecast of 2.3%. Despite the rate cut, economic growth remains lacklustre, and the ECB acknowledged that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual due to geopolitical tensions and trade policies.</p>

          <p>NBA teams have seen an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, largely driven by the addition of sponsor patches on team jerseys. The number of jersey patch deals more than doubled year-over-year, with six first-time NBA jersey partners contributing over $80 million in new spending. The opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome has also contributed to the overall sponsorship revenue increase.

          <p>The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to mitigate a future labor shortage, but analysts have differing views on its near-term impact on deflationary pressures. Morgan Stanley analysts suggest that AI could worsen deflationary pressures by disrupting the employment market, especially given China's existing high youth unemployment. They believe companies might prioritize AI adoption over hiring, leading to wage deceleration. However, Standard Chartered's Ding Shuang argues that AI is not a primary driver of deflation, citing overcapacity in some industries and sluggish domestic demand as the main causes. The article discusses the potential economic impacts of AI adoption in China.</p>
