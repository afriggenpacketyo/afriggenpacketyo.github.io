          <p>Tesla is asking its investors to approve a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him additional shares if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. The proposal would also give Musk more voting power within the company, which he has been requesting since early 2024. Tesla Chairwoman Robyn Denholm stated that the plan is intended to keep Musk motivated and focused on delivering for the company, with rewards tied to ambitious market capitalization and operational targets. Shareholders will also vote on whether Tesla should invest in Musk's AI venture, xAI, which has merged with his social network, X.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A French couple received suspended jail sentences for illegally keeping a black panther named Louise in their apartment, after the animal escaped and was found roaming on rooftops. The court condemned the man to 18 months in jail, suspended, and a $17,000 fine, while the woman received a four-month suspended sentence. Animal rights groups argued that keeping Louise was a form of species trafficking and mistreatment, as the animal's needs could not be met in captivity. Louise, now renamed Akilla, resides at a big cat sanctuary in the Netherlands and is reportedly doing well. </p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Chinese citizens are divided over whether China should seek global dominance or share leadership in world affairs. While a majority does not view the U.S. as a friend, they favor a balanced approach toward Washington, cooperating when possible and limiting U.S. power when necessary. The top two perceived threats to China involve the United States: economic competition and potential conflict over Taiwan. Most Chinese citizens support their country's participation in world affairs and believe international trade is beneficial, contrasting with opinions in the U.S. The study provides unique insights into Chinese views on international relations amid global instability. </p>

          <p>Retail sales in July saw a boost from sunny weather and the women's Euro football tournament, according to official figures. Sales volumes rose by 0.6%, exceeding analysts' expectations, with clothing and footwear stores, as well as online retailers, experiencing strong growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) noted that while sales volumes rose in July, sales in the three months to July were down 0.6% compared to the previous three months. The ONS apologized for errors in past data and said it had improvement plans in place, while economists cautioned that the boosts from weather and football were temporary.

          <p>The Dearborn Heights Police Department in Michigan has introduced an "optional patch" featuring text in both Arabic and English. The patch includes the words "DEARBORN HEIGHTS" and "POLICE" written in both languages, designed to reflect and honor the diversity of the community. Officer Emily Murdoch created the patch to represent unity, respect, and a shared commitment to service, particularly for residents of Arabic descent. While the department emphasized the patch is optional and celebrates the city's rich cultures, it has drawn criticism from some, including Republican Rep. Randy Fine, who suggested it was a step towards implementing sharia law. </p>

          <p>Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska believes that China needs to develop a yuan-based payment system to build a multipolar world, but that Chinese banks are too dependent on dollar assets and scared to take any risk. China should also accelerate its efforts to expand a yuan-based debt market to boost international use of the Chinese currency in financial settlements. China needs a global debt market for its trade. Deripaska's remarks come as China seeks to increase its global influence and challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.  (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The author reflects on a Brightline train trip from Orlando to Miami, highlighting the potential for improved transportation in Florida. The author suggests that a Tampa station could materialize by 2029, although others are less certain of that prediction. Despite Brightline's financial and safety concerns, the author believes train travel is a welcome relief from highway travel and that a Brightline train in Tampa could offer more convenient access to Orlando attractions. They envision a future where residents can easily access theme parks and events without the stress of driving, making the experience more enjoyable and less expensive. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study suggests that a single dose of LSD can alleviate anxiety and depression for months, particularly in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Participants receiving higher doses of LSD (100 or 200 micrograms) showed significant improvements by the next day, which lasted throughout the 12-week study. However, some experts caution that non-drug factors, such as the sensory environment during treatment, may have influenced the results. The research represents a growing trend in psychedelic studies, with larger, more rigorous trials aimed at gaining FDA approval for psychedelic drugs like LSD, MDMA, and psilocybin to treat psychiatric conditions. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is releasing a record $387 million for affordable housing projects this fall, marking the largest solicitation in the L.A. Housing Department's history. The majority of the funds come from Measure ULA, the "mansion tax" on property sales above $5 million. The funds will support new construction, housing preservation, and operating assistance, with applications open to nonprofit and for-profit developers. The strategic shift aims to expedite construction amid a housing crisis, with funding based on a percentage of development costs.

          <p>The Troubadour Theater Company's latest production, "Oedipus the King, Mama!," combines the tragedy of Sophocles' "Oedipus the King" with the music of Elvis Presley at the Getty Villa. The show, directed by Matt Walker, features a Freudian carnival of psychosexual madness with an Elvis impersonator and commedia dell'arte-style shenanigans. While the music still captivates, the show feels overextended, and the Elvis parody seems tired, but Beth Kennedy's performance as Jocasta is a standout. The costumes and puppet design do the heavy lifting, and the production offers levity, even if it feels half-baked. </p>

          <p>The article explores why, despite broad support for organ donation, the number of organ donors remains relatively low. Only a small fraction of registered donors die in circumstances suitable for organ retrieval, and families can block donations. Living donation is also limited by psychological and practical barriers, such as costs and lengthy evaluations. Medical mistrust and religious concerns also contribute to low registration rates. The End Kidney Deaths Act, which would provide tax credits to kidney donors, is presented as a potential solution to increase donation rates. </p>

Despite the challenges, investors welcomed the reprieve, and Orsted shares rose. The company also cut its full-year operating profit outlook due to lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds. </p>
