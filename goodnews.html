          <p>Eli Lilly announced its diabetes drug Mounjaro demonstrated significant health benefits in a large-scale trial compared to its older drug, Trulicity. The study showed Mounjaro reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by 8% and, more profoundly, lowered the rate of death from any cause by 16%. While the results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a primary treatment for Type 2 diabetes, its higher cost and slightly more prevalent side effects remain key considerations for doctors and insurers. The company plans to submit the data to regulators, potentially expanding its approved uses by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that artificial intelligence does not pose an imminent threat to the design software company. He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. The company, which recently priced its IPO shares at $33, is valued at $19.3 billion after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory challenges. Field's comments contrast with the growing focus on superintelligence by other tech leaders like Meta's Mark Zuckerberg.</p>

          <p>Meta's stock jumped over 10% after the company reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations. The social media giant posted revenue of $47.52 billion, a 22% year-over-year increase, driven by strong advertising performance attributed to its AI technology. CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined a vision for developing "superintelligence" to empower users, justifying the company's massive investments in AI talent and infrastructure. Despite a $4.53 billion operating loss in its Reality Labs division, Meta raised its third-quarter sales forecast, signaling continued confidence in its growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old boy named Majid Shaghnobi, who suffered severe jaw injuries from an Israeli tank shell in Gaza, has become the first war-injured child to be brought to the UK for medical care. His arrival was facilitated by Project Pure Hope, a volunteer group of medical professionals, for reconstructive surgery at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital. The procedure aims to restore function to his face so he can eat and speak properly again. This development comes nearly two years into the conflict and follows a recent promise by the UK Prime Minister to evacuate more seriously injured children from the region.</p>

          <p>NASA and SpaceX were forced to scrub the launch of the Crew-11 mission to the International Space Station just 67 seconds before liftoff due to adverse weather conditions. A cumulus cloud over the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center violated safety rules, delaying the flight. The crew includes commander Zena Cardman and pilot Michael Fincke, who were reassigned to this mission after issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule altered previous flight plans. The next launch opportunity is scheduled for Friday, though the weather forecast remains a concern for the mission aboard the record-setting sixth flight of the Crew Dragon Endeavour.</p>

          <p>Chaplain Joon Park of Tampa General Hospital in Florida provides spiritual care to patients facing death, an experience he believes is profoundly spiritual. He observes that in moments of crisis, people often turn to faith, though their reactions can range from seeking comfort to expressing anger at God, both of which he validates as spiritual experiences. Park, who found his own path to faith after a difficult childhood, says he is more likely to find God in the hospital's hallways than in a church. He has learned that where there is suffering, the presence of love reflects the divine.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee has advanced legislation to prohibit members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. In an 8-7 vote, Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats to move the bill forward, despite opposition from other Republicans who argued it was an unfair attack on wealth. The bill, now called the Honest Act, aims to curb potential conflicts of interest and has received conceptual support from President Trump, though he later criticized Hawley on social media. It remains uncertain if the legislation will receive a full vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

          <p>This article explores impostor syndrome, the psychological phenomenon where high-achieving individuals doubt their skills and fear being exposed as a fraud. First identified in the 1970s, it particularly affects those in technical fields, perfectionists, and introverts. To combat these feelings, the article suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of accomplishments, and joining a community of peers to share insecurities and realize such doubts are common. The author notes that genuinely feeling like an impostor is often a sign that you are not one.</p>
