          <p>Researchers are increasingly uncovering instances of harmful AI responses, including hate speech, copyright infringements, and sexual content, highlighting the urgent need for regulations and thorough testing. Javier Rando, an AI researcher, points out the current inability to fully control AI behavior, while Shayne Longpre advocates for expanding AI testing to include diverse users like journalists and subject matter experts. Standardized AI flaw reports and incentives are proposed to disseminate information effectively, mirroring successful practices in software security. Combining user-centered practices with governance and policy is crucial for understanding and mitigating the risks posed by AI tools and users. The adoption of these practices would ensure a better understanding of AI's potential risks.</p>

          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, is now available at GP surgeries in England for individuals meeting strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. This phased approach aims to prioritize those most in need while managing GP workload and NHS resources, although some practices caution patients not meeting the criteria against booking appointments. Pharmacy trade organizations express concerns about potential supply shortages due to high demand, as Mounjaro requires monthly check-ups and wrap-around care. The drug, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, has shown significant weight loss results in clinical trials, making it a promising but carefully managed treatment option.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with nearly half of all cars sold last year being electric. Government subsidies, long-term planning, and a focus on dominating future technologies have driven this success. China's BYD now leads the global EV market, surpassing Tesla, and numerous Chinese start-ups are producing affordable EVs for the mass market. The government's investment of around $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 has fostered a competitive landscape and a culture of innovation, with companies like CATL dominating battery production.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist is planning to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year as an alternative treatment for severe depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire offering ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression. While ketamine is not licensed for routine depression treatment, it can be prescribed 'off-label' by doctors and psychiatrists. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution over the use of ketamine therapy but is due to publish a new report on psychedelics later this year, with updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>60 Minutes explores the lives of sloths, the world's slowest mammal, and how their slow-paced lifestyle has enabled them to survive for 64 million years. Zoologist Lucy Cooke explains that sloths' slow movements are an energy-saving adaptation to their vegetarian diet, which involves digesting toxins from leaves. Cooke highlights the unique adaptations of sloths, including their poor eyesight and hearing, and their ability to move like tai chi masters in trees. The story also touches on conservation efforts to protect sloths from human threats, such as power lines, and the impact of climate change on their survival.</p>
