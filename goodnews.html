          <p>The long-running mystery of the band 'Patchwork' on the Glastonbury Festival lineup was solved when Britpop icons Pulp took the Pyramid Stage for a surprise performance. Lead singer Jarvis Cocker and the band played a set celebrating the 30th anniversary of their historic 1995 headline appearance at the festival. The performance included classic hits like "Common People" and "Sorted for E's & Wizz," alongside new material from their chart-topping album "More!". The nostalgic and celebratory set was a major highlight of the festival, culminating in a flypast by the Red Arrows.</p>

          <p>A massive crowd, estimated by organizers at up to 200,000 people, participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a new "child protection" law that restricts gatherings considered to be promoting homosexuality, with attendees risking fines and organizers facing potential prison time. The march was attended by numerous European officials and MEPs in a show of solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ+ community. The defiance is seen as a significant challenge to Orban's nationalist government and its policies restricting civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A parent expresses strong support for their 17-year-old son's decision to attend flight school after high school instead of pursuing a traditional four-year university degree. The article highlights the rising cost of college tuition and the burden of student loan debt as key factors making alternative career paths more appealing. The author notes that for their son, who is passionate and focused on becoming an airline pilot, a direct path through a private flight school is a more practical and financially sound choice. This plan allows him to gain specific career training without incurring debt for a degree he is not interested in.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outperforming the rest of the field by more than half a second. Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, signaling a return to form after a season marked by qualifying errors. The strong performance was aided by recent car upgrades, including a revised front suspension designed to improve his feel for the car. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start second, with Norris's teammate and championship leader Oscar Piastri in third, while rival Max Verstappen had a difficult session, qualifying seventh.</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Co. has announced its plan to remove all artificial colors from its consumer products by the end of 2027. The company will also eliminate synthetic dyes from food sold to K-12 schools by the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its products, like Uncrustables, are already free of these additives, some items such as sugar-free jams, ice cream toppings, and certain Hostess brand snacks still contain them. This move follows similar pledges from other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz amid increased regulatory scrutiny of artificial dyes.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team started their Australian tour with a decisive victory over the Western Force in Perth, but the win was marred by an injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams. Williams, who scored two tries, left the field with a tight hamstring, raising concerns about depth at the position and a potential need for a replacement player to be called up. Coach Andy Farrell also noted a high penalty count in the first half, which he attributed to over-eagerness. Despite the imperfections, the team showcased an ambitious attacking style, with fly-half Finn Russell's creativity central to their play.</p>

The dealership contacted police, who set up a sting operation and arrested three men.

The massive haul, which is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the UK, was discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The UK Border Force stated that container ships are a primary method used by criminal organizations to smuggle drugs into the country.
