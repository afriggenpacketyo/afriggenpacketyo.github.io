          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a roughly 2% increase amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a 250 billion yen share buyback and an operating income that surpassed estimates. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year reached 203.6 billion yen, exceeding analyst expectations. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to Sony Group shareholders through dividends. Despite this positive news, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March was somewhat lackluster, with a slight 0.3% increase in operating profit forecasted due to potential impacts from trade relations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face challenges in finding qualified money managers. A major issue is trust, with families often prioritizing lifelong relationships over expertise when hiring. This selectivity, combined with competition from banks and private equity firms, leads to a talent crunch. Additionally, younger employees are reluctant to work at family offices due to a lack of clear corporate structure and the perception of it being a "retirement job," and this is compounded by the fact that investment-related roles in family offices tend to be harder to fill compared to other roles.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages in key sectors. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to prioritize British workers over cheaper overseas labor. However, businesses fear that Brits cannot or will not fill the gap, especially in sectors like health and social care, which heavily rely on migrant staff. Care England warns that ending overseas recruitment for social care visas could have serious consequences for a sector already under immense pressure with 131,000 vacancies.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that Iran dismantle its nuclear program, according to The New York Times article. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi suggested the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The proposal entails Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. This plan would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal, and could address American concerns about Iran's nuclear program.</p>

The luxury jet was offered due to delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump clarified that the jet is a gift to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar and will be retired to the presidential library once Boeing delivers the new AF1 fleet. He also noted that it would save taxpayers money, as the military would not have to pay for a new plane.</p>

          <p>President Trump received a warm and opulent welcome from the Saudi crown prince, reflecting the amity between a royal family and presidential family with diplomatic and business alliances, according to The New York Times article. The Royal Court had the feel of a Mar-a-Lago East, with giant crystal chandeliers, polished marble, and prominently displayed portraits of King Salman bin Abdulaziz. Trump spoke at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, where he was given a tour of what his Saudi hosts called the “gallery of memories,” which told a story of “nearly eight decades of Saudi-American partnership.”</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez were resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole, marking the latest step in their years-long effort to be released after 35 years behind bars. Judge Michael Jesic reduced their sentence, and a decision on their potential release must next be made by the state parole board. The Menendezes claimed they killed their parents out of self-defense after years of sexual assault. The article notes that family members and those who worked with them in prison detailed the educational courses they completed and programs they created to improve the lives of inmates.</p>
