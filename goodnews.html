          <p>A severe heat wave is affecting the eastern United States, with numerous cities experiencing record-high temperatures as a result of a "heat dome" phenomenon, where high pressure traps heat and humidity. New York City's JFK Airport recorded 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the highest since 2013, and other cities like Boston and Baltimore also saw temperatures exceeding 100 degrees. Hospitals reported an increase in heat-related illnesses, and public transportation faced disruptions, while utilities urged customers to conserve power. The National Weather Service anticipates improved conditions in the coming days, but the heat wave has already impacted over 150 million people. </p>

Additionally, SBI Shinsei Bank plans to repay the remaining 230 billion yen in public funds received after the collapse of its predecessor, marking the completion of government bailout repayments following Japan's asset price bubble.

          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory over former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who conceded before ranked-choice votes were fully counted. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, led with 44% of the first-choice votes, capitalizing on social media virality and enthusiasm among younger voters. Cuomo, who resigned from the governorship amidst sexual harassment allegations, conceded, stating that Mamdani had put together a great campaign and inspired young people.

          <p>A study led by China proposes creating a global green-energy network to meet the world's energy demands by 2050, using interconnected solar and wind energy systems. The proposed network would produce three times the amount of power needed at a lower cost than independent regional systems, according to researchers from China, Denmark, and the United States. The team acknowledges that establishing such a system would require navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, but successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, reduce decarbonization costs, and enhance resilience against conflict and climate extremes.</p>

The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, awarding her damages of A$70,000.

          <p>The Boston Celtics are trading Kristaps Porzingis to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team deal that also involves the Brooklyn Nets. The move aims to give the Celtics more flexibility moving forward, after they agreed to trade Jrue Holiday to Portland earlier in the week. Elsewhere, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks have agreed to a $119 million, three-year contract extension. The new contract aligns Irving with co-star Anthony Davis, who joined the Mavericks in a trade that sent Luka Donƒçiƒá to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>

          <h2>Plan to Sell Off Public Lands Halted for Now</h2>

          <p>A controversial proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was stripped from the Republican tax and spending bill for violating Senate rules. The proposal, advanced by Senator Mike Lee, aimed to sell up to 3.3 million acres of public land managed by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management for housing needs. The Senate parliamentarian determined the proposal didn‚Äôt meet the Byrd Rule. While the initial plan was scrapped, Senator Lee is working to revise the proposal.</p>
