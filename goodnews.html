        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow thunderstorm warning for much of southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, effective from 09:00 BST to 18:00 BST on Saturday. The agency cautions about potential transport disruptions due to heavy showers, spray, and standing water, which may cause longer journey times and delays to train services. Short-term power losses and damage to buildings from potential lightning strikes are also likely, with the possibility of 10-15mm of rain falling in less than an hour in some areas. This follows a record-breaking dry spring, where England experienced only 32.8mm of rain last month, indicating that rainfall on Saturday could exceed the entire amount from May. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered interest rates by 100 basis points to 20%, marking the first cut since September 2022, signaling an easing of inflation pressures. The rates had been held at 21% since October of last year, the highest level since the new benchmark rate was introduced in 2013. Inflation in April was reported at 6.2%, down from an average of 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025, indicating a positive shift in the country's economic landscape. Russia's economy has faced immense strain due to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which has impacted prices and necessitated economic re-orientation amidst ongoing conflict.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As stablecoins gain mainstream acceptance, the U.S. Treasury market, particularly short-term securities, could face increased volatility due to their close ties with the cryptocurrency world. Proposed legislation aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially boosting their activity and increasing demand for short-term U.S. government debt. However, concerns arise that a sudden loss of confidence or regulatory pressures could trigger large-scale liquidations, depressing Treasury prices and disrupting fixed-income markets. If passed, the stablecoin bill would require tokens to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasury bills, potentially increasing the amount of U.S. Treasuries held by stablecoin issuers.

          <p>For the U.S. men's national team (USMNT), the upcoming Concacaf Gold Cup presents a unique challenge, where winning may not necessarily equate to success. With key players missing, the tournament offers an opportunity to rehabilitate the team's reputation after a disappointing performance in the Concacaf Nations League. Coach Mauricio Pochettino can use this time to scout new depth pieces and tactical alternatives, particularly from Major League Soccer. The focus will be on cultivating a stronger team identity and intensity, even if winning the Gold Cup remains the ultimate goal, and this would provide a solid foundation for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States in northern Michigan. Using drone-based laser mapping, researchers revealed parallel rows of earthen mounds, remnants of raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. The scale of agriculture in this northerly location, which is not a major population center, is surprising, especially given the challenging growing conditions and the availability of wild rice nearby. The find highlights the advanced agricultural practices of Native Americans before European colonization and may represent just the "tip of the iceberg" in terms of previously underestimated agricultural landscapes.</p>

Topol also recommends specific medical tests beyond standard insurance coverage, such as Polygenic Risk Scores and DEXA scans, to personalize medical care and identify potential disease risks. He highlights the significance of nourishing the "gut-brain axis" through a diverse diet and vagus nerve stimulation, while also cautioning against both insufficient and excessive sleep.</p>

          <p>Recreational salmon fishing is resuming in California this weekend after a two-year shutdown aimed at helping the population recover, but with strict limits in place. While commercial fishing remains canceled for a third consecutive year, fishery regulators have allowed a limited recreational season with quotas. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is limiting ocean fishing under quotas in two windows in the summer and fall, with the first opening this weekend and allowing up to 7,000 salmon to be caught statewide. Biologists attribute the decline in salmon populations to dams, habitat loss, and global warming, and those in the fishing industry are hopeful for responsible water management and restoration efforts.</p>
