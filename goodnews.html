          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and lower the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) in an effort to bolster economic growth amid trade tensions with the United States. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, made the announcement shortly after China affirmed that Vice Premier He Lifeng would engage in trade talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. These measures signal Beijing's commitment to stabilizing its economy and supporting businesses affected by the ongoing trade war. The move also reflects China's willingness to negotiate with the US to resolve trade disputes. Optimism Score: 60</p>

          <p>Some fans expressed disappointment that Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh, both first-time attendees at the Met Gala, were seemingly dismissed during the event's coverage. During an interview, Vogue livestream co-hosts appeared unaware of Khan's global fame, prompting criticism online. Similarly, Dosanjh's red carpet appearance was brief and lacked an interview, leading to concerns that South Asian talent was not receiving adequate recognition.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, a major aluminum producer and consumer, relies on imported bauxite due to a lack of high-quality domestic ore. However, a French technology developed by Yves Ocello of IB2 could change this. The technology transforms low-grade bauxite into a high-quality material by neutralizing silica and sulfur, making it suitable for the Bayer process. IB2 has signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement this technology, potentially reducing China's dependence on imported aluminum ore.

The move comes as the trade war is redrawing the map of global supply chains, with tariffs reshaping the way goods are sourced and traded across borders. Therrien's shift reflects a growing trend among businesses seeking to adapt to the changing global trade landscape. Optimism Score: 65</p>
