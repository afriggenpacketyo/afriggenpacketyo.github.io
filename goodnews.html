          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract by the U.S. Defense Department to develop artificial intelligence tools for national security challenges, marking the first such contract for the company. The agreement falls under OpenAI's new initiative, OpenAI for Government, and aims to improve administrative operations, healthcare services for service members, and cyber defense. CEO Sam Altman expressed pride in engaging in national security areas, while emphasizing that all use cases must align with OpenAI's usage policies. This contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, which is generating over $10 billion in annualized sales, and follows Microsoft's authorization to use Azure OpenAI service with classified information.</p>

          <p>The Senate Finance Committee's version of President Trump's tax bill differs from the House-passed version, potentially leading to a clash between the two chambers. Key differences include the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, Medicaid work requirements, and child tax credit amounts. The Senate proposes keeping the SALT cap at $10,000, while the House offers deductions up to $40,000 for those making less than $500,000 annually. The Senate bill also includes a $5 trillion increase to the federal debt limit, which some senators oppose, and phases out solar energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act at a slower rate than the House version.

          <p>The capsizing and subsequent relaunch of a North Korean warship provides insights into Kim Jong Un's regime, highlighting its focus on building a nuclear-armed navy. Kim Jong Un publicly denounced the failure as a "criminal act" and ordered immediate restoration, showcasing his seriousness about modernizing North Korea's naval capabilities. Experts suggest that publicizing the incident was a deliberate political strategy, shifting away from concealing negative truths to demonstrate accountability. The rapid repair of the warship, completed in just over three weeks, defied expectations and was used to demonstrate the regime's effectiveness.</p>

          <p>China is using its dominance in rare earth elements as leverage in trade negotiations with the United States. Rare earths are vital components in various modern technologies, including smartphones, electric vehicles, and military applications. During recent high-level trade talks in London, China and the U.S. agreed in principle to a framework for review by their leaders. This strategy contrasts with previous trade talks in 2018, where China's attempts at moral persuasion failed to impress then-President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite National Park's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, adding an extra 500 campsites.

The additional openings are expected to be a welcome relief for the park, which had more than 4 million visitors in 2024. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a spot at the famed park is notoriously competitive, and reservations often fill up minutes after they open.</p>

The steel industry still faces 25% tariffs for now, although this is less than the US‚Äôs global rate of 50% on steel and aluminium.

The judge ordered that grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit be reinstated.
