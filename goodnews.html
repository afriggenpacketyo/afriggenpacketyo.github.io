        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kraft Heinz announced it will remove artificial dyes from its U.S. products by the end of 2027 and will immediately cease producing new products containing these dyes. This decision follows a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to replace synthetic food dyes with natural alternatives. The company stated that 10% of its products currently contain artificial dyes and that they have already invested in finding natural replacements, with many products already using natural or no colors. The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, but some states have enacted bans to restrict their use. The company plans to focus on beverages and desserts portfolios, including certain products sold under brands like Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate in the 4.25% to 4.5% range at its upcoming meeting. This decision reflects a cautious approach as the Fed monitors the impact of President Trump's economic policies, particularly tariffs. While consumer sentiment has shown some improvement, uncertainty remains, and the inflation rate slightly increased in May to 2.4%. Experts predict a very high probability that the Fed will hold steady, citing a lack of compelling reasons to cut rates given the current economic conditions. The Fed's decision will be announced at 2 p.m. EST, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell.</p>

          <p>Streaming services have surpassed the combined viewership of broadcast and cable TV for the first time, representing 44.8% of total TV viewership in May, according to Nielsen. This milestone marks a significant shift in viewing habits, with streaming's share increasing by 71% since 2021, while broadcast and cable have declined. The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV (FAST) channels, the rise of YouTube, and traditional media companies shifting to streaming-centric models. YouTube now represents the highest share of any streamer, accounting for 12.5% of all television viewing.</p>

          <p>A cultural shift is occurring in which women are increasingly embracing strength training, challenging traditional beauty standards that prioritize thinness. Three new books explore the meaning of women embracing strength and the cultural symbolism of muscles. While strength training is seen as an empowering alternative, there is concern that old body neuroses from the pursuit of thinness are transferring to the new muscular ideal. The trend of women getting stronger is part of a larger wellness culture, where optimizing health is increasingly valued.</p>

          <p>While meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at the G7 summit, President Trump displayed a trade agreement signed with the UK, accidentally dropping the document and initially misidentifying it as an agreement with the European Union. The White House clarified that the agreement was indeed with the United Kingdom. Trump stated that the agreement was similar to one signed in May and praised Starmer's performance as Prime Minister. The White House provided additional details on steel and aluminum in the US-UK agreement, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick setting a quota of products that can enter the U.S. without being subject to the 25% Section 232 tariff.</p>

          <p>The value of Costco's gold bars has increased significantly due to a sharp rise in spot gold prices, leading to high demand and purchase restrictions. Gold is currently trading near record highs, driven by geopolitical instability and concerns about the U.S. dollar. A 1-ounce gold bar purchased at Costco in June 2024 for $2,399.99 could now be worth $3,390, representing a 41.3% increase. Selling gold involves considering the spot price, potential fees, and tax implications, with profits taxed at a higher rate than other investments. (not investment advice)</p>
